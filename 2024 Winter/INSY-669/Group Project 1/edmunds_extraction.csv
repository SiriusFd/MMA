BTW - trunk volume of the TL is only 12.5 cubic feet compared with 14.8 for the G35 (330i is 12.0) so I could argue that the G35 is overall (passenger plus trunk) a larger car than the TL with a much smaller turning radius. The TL is at a disadvantage in terms of maneuverability because of its front wheel drive design....not trying to reopen the front-vs-rear debate.I think that the TL is a great overall car.

An e90 M3 sedan would be great but far too many people make an ignorant connection between 2 doors and sports cars v. 4 door cars.

I have a TL (big) and a 911 (small) and I can honestly say that neither one of them can do a complete one shot U-turn on my street, and yet neither one of them has ever presented me with the slightest problem in DC's tightest underground parking garages.

Came out to find the only other car in the section, a FX35, immediately on my left a full two feet into my parking space, making it impossible for me to open my door wide enough to access the back seat. Intentional, who knows? But as I was loading both of my kids into the back from the passenger side, guy pulls up in a utility van and says ""looks like you need help"". He then pulls in tight next to the drivers side of the Infiniti with about 3"" to spare and has his buddy back into the space I'm vacating. There was no way anyone was getting inside that Infiniti except through the rear hatch. Not something I would encourage in front of my kids, but I definitely got a kick out of it.  "

My husband and I decided we need to get another car given my outback can't be in two places at the same time and his '67 MGB--WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE GARAGE SINCE WE GOT MARRIED--isn't about to leave it soon, at least not in my lifetime. So as we were about to sign on the dotted line for an Avalon last weekend, we came to our senses in time and decided we weren't ready for the grave yet. So what do you buy when you don't want to end up with the babyboomers version of your parents' Pontiac? A G35coupe of course. Since this is a website for owners, surely you'll understand the logic. I haven't seen much discussion about the 06, so I'm hoping someone can enlighten me. Have the paint problems been resolved? have they upgraded the rotors? I am completely confused about the tires. I know we will need to buy snows--we live in Boston, and I've been traumatized since driving school a million years ago about hydroplanning in the rain, so what's the best tire strategy. Since I can't read a map, I like the idea of a nav system, but I don't like it that my husband can't reprogram it while I'm driving. Does this mean i should get a Magellean at Costco and defile the dash with it? Biggest question, and one that's been asked in another forum I think, should we wait until the 07 come out (and when is that?). We're planning on leasing. I'm thinking we should go ahead with the 06, allow time for the problems in the 07 to surface, and trade in for the 08, or something like that. Is there conventional wisdom about this?Please advise. Thanks.  "
"mnrep2","April 2006"," The paint is soft on most new cars,although it sounds like some posters have run into a relatively small batch of G35's that have problems with the clear coat. You would need snow tires with the coupe. Stay away from the G NAV option. For that money there are much better aftermarket solutions. The brake problems were nothing more than high performance pads that shed a lot of dust and wore out quickly. The 06 models have gone to a different type of pad. The new coupe will be out in 2007. If you did a two year lease now you could get the next generation model after it has been on the market for a year Why don't you look at and then test drive the G35x. You have AWD, (when you need it) four doors and pretty great performance and handling. I own a 05 X and love it.

"primetime79","May 2006"," Let me preface my post by unequivocally stating the mere facts. I am not an automobile professional. I have no loyalty to any automobile manufacturer. I enjoy a exhilirating driving experience.Three years ago (2003), I was in the market for a sedan that had a certain level of sport and luxury. I narrowed my search to four cars. 1.) BMW 330I 2.) Audi A4 1.8T 3.) Lexus Is 300 4.) Infinity G 35 . Quickly this search was down to two as the Lexus IS 300 had absolutely nothing to offer in the form a luxury offering and the Infinity was much of the same although not to Lexus extreme. The ""feel"" of the steering wheel and all other components of the Inifity made it quite apparent that the build quality of this car was not up to par. So it was down to two cars, The BMW 330I and the Audi A4 1.8T. The 330I was much faster than the A4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the A4. Maybe it's me, but the 330I was not impressive at all. I felt like it was a regular family sedan. I have nothing against BMW, but sometimes I wonder if sometimes their maybe a little bit of brainwashing or speaking something to existent, with the over hyped driving (handling) experience. For me it came down to the getting the best car for ME. The A4 exemplified te best handling (feedback), the best interior. The build quality on this car was impeccable. Unfortunately due to circumstance beyond my control (wife) I had to trade in my Audi a year ago for a SUV. Fast forward to the present, and I have been blessed to make the same purchase decision again. Again it came down to the eact same 4 cars with a little thought given to the Acura TSX. But after a close up encounter with the TSX , while the car is a phenomenal value it was apparent is was nothing more than that a ""phenomenal value"". So i test drove the same 4 cars again. The Infinity now with the 6MT was a nice car but lacked in the same area interior refinement and the short throw clutch felt like my brothers 95 Mitsubishi Eclipse (cheap). Next on the list was the Audi. The new Audi A4 had undergone some minor changes most notably HP improvement. Overall the car was better than the one I once had, but suprisingly was 6k more similiarly equipped. This posed a problem. It was then down to two cars the IS 350 and the 330I. Lots of people do not like the new 330I exterior. But I think while it may not be a sporty as the IS per se, it is definielty more profounding and unique. As usual when I went for my test drive of the BMW i walked into the dealership and was treated as an outkast. I guess this car either sells itself, or I did not look like the typical BMW client ready to make a purchase. In my usual car shopping attire I wore shorts, flip flops and a white wife-beater shirt with my bling bling on. Finally someone came to help me and I was in the BMW 330I. First glance of the 330I interior I did know what to think. After 30 seconds of looking at it, this understated interior started looking growingly bland. Once on the road, I could not figure out what all this Hoopla was about. Immediately I went straight to Lexus dealership to figure out what changes Lexus made to the IS. At first glance I fell in love with it's beauty. I then told the sales person order me a black on black with navi, but it has to be manual. It was at that time my heart was broken. No manual for 350. Never had I ever thought, I would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. But the sales person was adamant that I at least try it out. The rest is history. I am a proud owner of a IS 350 Crystal White Navi. This car is not only super quick but handles excellent. I have driven it several times with the VDIM off and it makes a huge difference. Around corners with the VDIM on it cuts the throttle to quickly. I must advise the average driver to be careful, because this is a RWd car and they tend to spin out rather quickly. But after two weeks of owning it I am extremely ecstatic about my decision. I personally think BMW might be overhyped, Audi are underpowered, Infiiniti are built with less interior refinement and overall build quailty. Lexus Is 350 for me at least is the perfect blend, if you do not want to buy the car do not test drive it!!!!!!!!!p.s sorry I am a little long winded "
"pgsmith","May 2006"," My experience @ BMW was similar. Obviously I did not conform to their image of a BMW owner having worn a t-shirt and shorts into their showroom. They wasted no time in regaling stories of who they knew when I explained where I worked (Ho-hum, I was there to see the vehicles). After we spent (too much) time in the the salesman's cubicle, I learned they did not have a car with the equipment they learned I might be wanting, but they would happily order it for me.I said great, but I wanted to actually drive a car to see if the car was really what I would like. I was told that:1. They did not even have a car that had an automatic (wife's requirement, not mine) I could test drive (which I saw later the same day on the lot). :confuse: 2. They would not let me test drive a red car since I was not interested in red and that would put miles on a car someone else would buy. :confuse:3. They had a blue one waiting to be prepped. When I indicated that it might be OK to accept blue, The vehicle was not prepped even within a week, at which point I had to ""make them"" let me test drive the red one. :confuse: End results:1. I was offended by their arrogance. :mad: 2. I was not very impressed by the vehicle.3. I bought a competitors vehicle (C280), which I am happy with.4. I will continue to vehicle shop in the future in shorts, jeans, t-shirts, flip-flops, running shoes, as this will help me decide about they ability of the dealership to be confident in the car not try to sell the ""image"".5.

"redsoxgirl","May 2006"," I respect your right to have the opinion that the IS350 is the right car for you, but I strongly disagee that it is even close to the ""best luxury/sport sedan"" on any objective basis.Clearly you have a different definition of ""sport"" than I do as it pertains to how a car accelerates, handles, steers, brakes, performs - as well as how connected to the road and driver it is. As evidence:The 330I was much faster than the A4, but to me it lacked the handling prowlness of the A4.How anyone could conclude the ""handling prowess"" of a 60/40 imbalanced FWD A4 is superior to that of the 50/50 balanced RWD 330i is an enigma. Are you sure you weren't overly enamored with the interior of the A4 to forget to put it through a serious test drive against the 330i? Never had I ever thought, I would own a sports/luxury car that was not manual. But the sales person was adamant that I at least try it out. The rest is history.Again, perhaps having come out of a 170 hp A4, you were enamored with the 300+ hp IS350. But that automatic transmission removes any ""sport"" there might have been in the car for me. Sorry, drag racing doesn't fit my driving style. I have never owned a BMW and I am not sure I ever will. But in searching for a compact to mid size sport sedan to replace my Boxster S this fall, the IS350 doesn't make the long list, let alone the short list on the ""sport"" criteria. Great little luxury car, perhaps. True sport sedan compared to the 3-series, no way. At least not for me. "
"primetime79","May 2006"," Just ought of curiousity. Have you ever test driven the IS 350 before. Because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth. The car has excellent steering feel. My only complaint is the VDIM killing the throttle to early when the wheel starts losing traction. I guess I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner. "
"redsoxgirl","May 2006"," Just ought of curiousity. Have you ever test driven the IS 350 before. Because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter smooth.Yes, I've driven the IS350. My cousins own a Lexus dealership and they will sell me one (or any Lexus model) for their cost, so I had hoped to like it. The IS350 is a decent automatic. But it's an automatic. It's probably better than BMW steptronic, comparable to the Mercedes/AMG ""manumatic"" and not as good as the Porsche tiptronic. And I would never own one of those. I wouldn't even be happy with the BMW M3 ""SMG"" transmission. It's not an ""objective"" performance thing for me, it's a subjective feel, control and driving enjoyment. If you are enough of a ""driver"" to have tested the limits of the VDIM and don't like that interference, I am surprised you don't agree, but that's your perogative. I am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the IS wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the BMW handles/feels/brakes better and declare them a winner.I think your curiosity stems from thinking that 2 or 3 objective performance measures capture the entire essence of driving feel and enjoyment - and even true performance - for everybody. Gross oversimplification. As a management consultant, I spend 60 hours a week boiling down complex business strategy and financial issues to a few spreadsheets, graphs and Power Point slides. But at the end of the day, I can immediately tell you what executives ""get it"" and what ones don't, by how much they go behind the numbers rather than focus on them. So the last thing I'm going to do is pick my next car by looking in the back of Car and Driver or Road and Track at a bunch of statistics without spending a lot of time in the drivers seat froming my own subjective opinions. "
"primetime79","May 2006"," Apparently we have a few things in common as I too am a financial/management professional (Senior Investment Analyst). I honestly felt exactly the same way you did about automatics before I test drove the IS 350. This is the first automatic I have ever owned. The reason I don't have any significant issues with the VDIM is because it only comes into play when I feel like driving the car to it's limit (2% of the time). And besides as I mentioned you can easily turn it off in 15 seconds by starting the car with the parking brakes then tapping the brakes twice then the park brakes twice then the brakes twice. This takes no more than 15 seconds.I love my 350 dearly, however my first choice would have been the M3 if I was only patient enough to wait for the new M3 to come out. "

The dealer talked me into trying automatic (i was very surprised they don't have manual with this engine). After getting into it I saw nice pad-shifters and was prepared for a good impression. But after a minute a realized that you can't control CURRENT gear of your car - you only limit your MAXIMUM gear. you don't even know the gear that's currently on! My current automatic Subaru Legacy(165hp) is more sportier in that aspect (it always shows the actual gear that's on). I can't say anything about handling - I simply hadn't got that far with a test drive. It's a luxury, but not anywhere near sport regardless of numbers. Someone at Lexus should be fired for that type of design. "

The place where the e90 shines against the current competition - balance, handling, driver-feedback. Driving, there's no other sport sedan that feels the same right now. Or better. Bummer. At 140+ on the autobahn my e90 feels buttoned down and lets me know everything going on. That makes the car worth owning. Drive the Is350 hard and it becomes really clear it's not a sport sedan. It's a luxury cruiser with a big engine.The 07 G35 may finally be some competition for the 330i. Of course the 07 335i with 300 hp and 300 ft-lbs of torque from 1400-5000rpm will be hard to be in any fashion. "

"laurasdada","May 2006"," Having never driven one because of the following, imho:Credit to Caddy for beginning to define/redefine itself with the CTS. However, the overdone, unattractive exterior and cheap looking, disjointed in design interior along with the window sticker sent me quickly on my way the first time I encountered the CTS. Now, I may be missing a great ride, but I truly enjoy a nicely styled exterior and an interior that suits me is a must. While the interior does not have to be of the ultimate in materials, I do want a logical and attractive layout (as a reference, Audi and Lexus do interiors right in my book) as, of course, that is where I spend my time driving. The CTS (which may have been upgraded since last I looked?) I found quite lacking, especially given the asking price. But, I find all Cadillac models a bit aggressive in their prices. Hence rebates and ""Employee Pricing...""I chose the Acura TL as FWD is not a four letter word to me. I grew up with FWD (Saab, Honda, Mitsu, Renault!, VW...) and appreciate the snow country advantage (New Englnader & avid skier). I believe that Honda/Acura produces the best handling FWDs out there (and I know some RWD afficionados would consider that statement an oxymoron!) which suits me just fine. I may lose out to RWD at 9 or 10/10ths, but that is really just not an issue to me. In my comparison shopping, the TL offered the best combo of style, luxury, sport, economy, power and value.Maybe the next CTS will be a more suitable candidate. "
"corvettefan427","May 2006"," The new CTS should address the current models interior. Based on spy photos I've seen, and a review I read from a journalist who saw the car and described the interior as outstanding. As far as the exterior, if you don't like Caddy's styling theme, you probably still won't like the new one, although I think now that the styling has been introduced, it may be slightly more ''organic'' for 2008, although it's hard to tell. "
"shipo","May 2006"," I've seen all of the spy shots and artistic renditions that have come out and, so far at least, the new CTS is a non-starter for me. Is it better than the original?

"davids5","May 2006"," I am not sure that most people are on the same page here. Most people may have their own definition of what a sport sedan is and what sporty driving is. Working for the USAF in Europe, active duty and civilian duty I feel that I have a good idea of what sporty driving and what a sports sedan is. have almost 23 years of driving experience in Europe and 20 of them in Germany.To me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races,probably most of these so called sport sedans are not even equipped with the proper tires for high speed sporty driving. While most Americans come over here for the first time with their so called sport sedans and wagens and think 80mph is fast when driving well over 100 mph is a daily and normal ocurance over here.You dont see American Ford, GM,Honda,Toyota,etc burning up the track.Many ruin there vehicles or even kill themselves trying to keep up and prove something against the real high speed and sport vehicles like MB,BMW,Audi-VW (VAG)and of course Porsche.I feel that most have been brain washed and are easily sold on bells and sirens,dodads and smoke and mirror tricks that really dont do a thing for true performance and true longevity of a vehicle. I dont give a damn if one car has a better DVD-CD changer than the other car or has 20 cup holders.Our American car industry needs to start building good solid dependable vehicles starting with high powered engines that dont spend most of its time at the garage or at the gas station because its such a gas hog.Off base here in Germany a gallon of gas cost $6.86.They build powerfull engines over here that use very little gas and last and gives you years of satisfaction...... "
"redsoxgirl","May 2006"," Sorry, but after another test drive late yesterday, I am even more convinced the IS350 is not for me. In my opinion, if Lexus were serious about ""sport"" they would have a manaul 6-speed or at least fast shifting SMG. Blueguydotcom is right, this is a painfully slow downshifting transmission for anyone who really prefers the control of picking their own gear at any time.But even with a manual transmission, I still think the suspension and steering feedback are a couple of rungs down from BMW. I hate to say it - because I don't like the car - but the G35 was better in that regard.Lastly, re-read your ""15 second solution"" to overly interfering VDIM. Porsche has a button. BMW has a button. This is not a solution from a comapnay that has any serious intention of backing up their ""sport"" marketing with the real thing.The Lexus IS350 is a nice car for someone other than me. "
"fedlawman","May 2006"," ""To me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races""I tend to agree with you for the most part, but I don't think you can generalize ""Americans"" as a whole. Historically, Europeans have placed a higher value on handling than straight-line speed, but things have changed today. American cars today handle as well as they accelerate, and todays European cars have placed an emphasis on 0-60 and 1/4 mile performance - why do you think that is?The roads here are different, as are the laws (because our society is different). As a result, driving is different here. So, while I agree overall that European cars tend to perform better than American cars, let me play devil's advocate here and consider some current American cars - Although they're not my cup of tea personally, I could go to a dealer tomorrow and purchase a 2006 Corvette or Cadillac STS for less than $40,000. Are they as good as the European ""equivalent?"" Not likely, but they are outstanding cars in their segment and cost 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a ""comparable"" European car. The Corvette may not have the elegance and refinement of a Porsche 911, but on a twisty road or racetrack, they're pretty comparable. Both are rewarding to drive and own in their own way - a personal choice. The Cadillac vs. Mercedes is a similar comparison. I've been driving an S-Class Mercedes for 2 years now (company car) and, while it is a very substantial car and suprememly comfortable, it's not at all rewarding to drive from a performance perspective. It floats over the road with light, overboosted steering, and rolls hard in corners. I haven't driven the Cadillac, but I can't imagine it's significantly worse than the M-B.So, while I personlly prefer and own European cars (I have an E30 BMW M3 and a Volvo V70), I can understand why someone might enjoy the performance and personality of American cars for what they offer the driver - especially on our poorly maintained, poorly designed American roads.

But I'm also not looking for the ""luxury"" side to be at the expense of the ""sport"" side. I have driven a friend's previous generation BMW M3 sedan and it would fit my bill. And it ""only"" has 240 horsepower, 60+ short of the IS350, but the true overall performance (given what I'm looking for) is miles above the Lexus.

"allargon","May 2006"," This is somewhat off-topic discussing European vehicle superiority, but nearly every manufacturer you mentioned has a horrible reliability record. MB, VW and Audi are notorious. 20 years ago American cars had horrible reliability ratings. Most don't think that is the case now. Buick and Cadillac surpass Infiniti and Acura in quality according to JDP. European cars (and maybe Chinese cars) are now the ones known for lacking reliability. What good is the great driving ability of the car if it's always in the shop?Back to the topic, I love the exterior styling of the CTS. If you want an exterior that doesn't offend (or provoke any emotion), the Infiniti G35 sedan is for you. The exterior of the new 3 series doesn't do it for me, but it provokes emotion.Unless one wants to spend a significant amount of moolah aftermarketing the interior of the CTS (or even the G35), the current kings of the segment seem to be the IS350 and the 3 series.IMHO, value wise the CTS, G35 and the TL are the leaders of the cars in this segment as they are midsize vehicles compared to the compacts that are the A4, the 3 series, the C class and the Lexus IS. They are on the lower end of the price scale, too as the CTS and G35 both dip into the high 20's.(Anyone know why the Saab 9-3 and the Jaguar X-type aren't subjects for this forum?) "
"blueguydotcom","May 2006"," Do they even make the 9-3 and X type anymore? lolAs for your question about shop time v. driving, I'll take absolute fun for a day and nothing for a week over decent fun all the time.

But given the lackluster competition, it's tough to see how I could opt for milquetoast (IS350, A4) over fun. Maybe the 07 G35 - much better interior, better engine, supposedly bettersuspension - will be the competition the 3 series has lacked for over 20 years. Then again, my eyes are already on 08 for a 335i sedan with that turbo...yummy. "

The E36 is the first 3-series that moved upmarket and became ""luxurious,"" but by modern standards, it's still lightweight and nimble.They're not the best built car BMW ever produced (a result of BMW cost-cutting attempts), but they do possess a good blend of sports car dynamics and everyday comfort.Good luck with whatever you decide...

The A4 has been superb! It has sufficient speed, perhaps could use some more though, it handles very nicely on curves -- and also at 85 with unanticipated quick lane changes (for safety reasons). The interior is simply amazing (unless you are stuck in the back). I suspect, and hope, that the 325 will handle a bit sharper, and be a bit quicker (it better, it has 8 years on the Audi, and much fatter tires). It will be interesting to see where I end up on this debate. Perhaps if the stars are aligned, I'll end up thinking both are some of the best cars out there.... "

"dhamilton","May 2006"," I've only driven the 1.8 for about 20 minutes so I can't comment to much on it. I have driven both the BMW 330, 325, and both Audi engines [2.0T, 3.2.] To me the clutch in the BMW is rubbery and feels a bit vague as to when it's going to engage/disengage. I do think that there was better road feedback with the steering wheel but the downside to that is a nervousness that while on the track might be ok, but for daily driving is tiresome. I think the seats in the Audi were far superior. The thing is, bimmers are set up to not understeer, and with better weight distribution can carry more speeds in to corners. That's great, but I probably won't be there. I used to want an S4 for a track/everyday car [still kinda do] and had one on order but a family tragedy put that on hold for a while. BMW's are the hot thing right now, and for good reason. They got Audi licked on the car to take to the track on the way home. To me Audi is the better car to live with on a daily basis.

"gordonwd","May 2006"," I moved from a '98 A4 1.8T Quattro to a '04 (non-sport)325i, so feel qualified to make a comparison. The 325i, IMO, is superior to the A4 in most every way that counts to me (except for driving in the snow on stock all-season tires). It's not nearly as much contrast as what blueguy says, but we all know that he tends to be somewhat -- shall we say? -- strong in his opinions. First off, the difference in horsepower was very evident. The 325i is no hotrod at a rated 185 (?), but I think the A4 was only rated at 150, and we all know that BMW's horses tend to be larger than most. The handling on the Bimmer is definitely crisper, and brought an actual ""Wow!"" out of me the first time I took it through some real esses. I had never felt turn-in like that before, since I'd been driving FWD for many years, and Detroit RWD sleds before that.Other than that, the ride and road manners are very comparable, and both are very quiet and comfortable out on the highways. But the A4 could definitely run out of steam in some passing situations on the two-laners. The interior of the A4 was very nice, and it definitely had better climate control logic, but now I'm so used to the 325's cockpit-style dash that I was disappointed in the interior styling of the E90.As for styling, I really think that the A4 peaked out with the model that I owned and that the later revisions and new models have gotten steadily worse. That latest grille is scary and reminds me too much of an Edsel (if any of you out there remember those days). I also think that the 3-series styling peaked out with the facelifted E46 (just coincidentally the model that I happen to own), but styling is always a matter of opinion.So I really don't think that drivers of either brand have cause to throw stones at the other, especially when there are so many other brands more worthy of being thrown at.

I was out for a run a month or two back and went by a Chrysler dealership that had a new 300 SRT8 all done up in a black metallic sitting out front, and I have to admit, I was sorely tempted to at least ask for a test drive.Regarding mileage, true the SRT8 mileage is something like 17 at best on the highway, however, the 300C (with its variable displacement engine) isn't half bad, more like mid twenties on the highway according to the folks that I work with that have one.In the end, it really isn't my cup-o-tea, but if I needed a large fast sedan with lots of goodies, I'd certainly consider a virtually loaded 300C for under $42,000 (with every option except rear seat video and ash trays) as opposed to an M35, which when comparably equipped weighs in at nearly $55,000.Best Regards,Shipo "
"dhanley","May 2006"," Actually, the m35x gets 17/24 mpg, same as the 300c, but the 300c has a much more potent v8. Aside from that, it's not clear that the m35 has much of an edge on the 300M. Infiniti's comparator doesn't make a very strong case to buy the m over the 300c awd, especially considering the $8K price difference. "
"ivorypearlg","May 2006"," So sorry for the comparo... I should have did some research about the gas mileage. But in comparison the Chrysler does not have Vehicle Speed-Sensitive Power Steering, does not have luxury trim on the doors,does not have memory settings for the steering wheel or a power adjustable steering wheel, does not have front-seat active head restraints, and does not have a rear-center seat head restraint. All these are standard on the Infiniti, and none of those things are standard or optional on the Chrysler.Options that you can get on the Infiniti you can't get on the Chrysler include, Heated Rear Seats, Reclining seats, Cruise Control Distance Sensors, a rear heater, rear seat controls for the audio system, Bose audio system which in my opinion is much better then a Boston Sound System, which are the speakers on my computer.Things that are standard on the Infiniti that are optional on the Chrysler include an electronic sunroof,and side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers.Infiniti M35X- 3.5 LTR V-6 280 HP / 270 LB-TQChrysler 300C AWD- 5.7 LTR V-8 340 HP / 390 LB-TQChrysler 300C AWD- 41,051.00 Includes CD Navigation System, Sirus Sat Radio, Power Sunroof, High-in Headlights,Protection Group 2,and Hands free communication,rear back-up sensors and a few other small options. to see: http://www-5.chrysler.com/vehsuite/dispatch.doInfiniti M35X- 49,090.00 Includes DVD Navigation System, Sirus Sat Radio, climate controlled front seats, 8-SPKR Bose Audio System 6 disc auto changer, Rear View Monitor with camera, and pre-crash seat belts.

Welldhanley if you can afford the 8,000 difference I would consider the Infiniti M35X. "
"dhanley","May 2006"," No sweat. I've made statements i've had to retract lots of times. There are some options on the infiniti that you can't get on the 300C. And, doubtlessly the infiniti interior will be higher quality. Just saying that power and economy and the majority of features aren't really differentiating factors. And, it is impressive to me that chrysler puts that thumping pushrod v8 in a car (390 lb-ft!) and matches infinti's mpg. Heck, a subaru legacy GT gets 19/25 with it's 2.5T and manual tranny. I'm not too big on bose, but i'd have to hear the systems back to back to judge. The stereo in my (aging) bmw sucks. My old saab SE (harmon-kardon) was much better. A good sterio is on my list of must-haves for the next davemobile. As for my choosing between these two cars and the 8K price diff, my preferences run to stick shift & smaller & sportier.

For me, the IIHS top pick means all the cars in that list are safer than other midsize, and I wouldn't pick a Saab over BMW because the rear only got an acceptable vs good. That for the most part would not make a Saab safer overall. It would be the active features, passive features and overall handling, combined with crash test ratings that would make a BMW safer. The BMW would run rings around the Saab, as would the Infiniti. Being able to make an emergency maneuver with confidence is just as important as surviving a crash.In answer to your question, check my profile. "

"gordonwd","May 2006"," Some years back, I took part in a marketing ""focus group"" session to discuss AWD vehicles. Everyone drove a different vehicle, from me with an A4 Quattro to people with Subarus, SUVs, etc. (we found out afterward that the study was commissioned by Subaru, and their people were observing our session).Anyway, when the subject of safety came up, I was really appalled to hear people say things like ""my wife and I both totalled out our cars last year..."", and the general focus was on all the safety equipment. When I was asked if I felt that AWD contributed to safety, I responded that ""the best way to survive an accident is not to have the accident in the first place"", and I went on to say that I felt AWD to be a safety advantage in allowing me to more easily steer around a situation or otherwise maintain control. The others mostly just stared at me...After the session finished, some of the observers came in to chat informally. One of them came up to me and said ""I can tell that you are the motorcycle rider in the group since you're the only one who talked about safety in terms of avoidance instead of survival!"" He was entirely correct about that, and I took it as a definite compliment.

"lovemyclk","May 2006"," The MB is about at the end of it's platform cycle with a new C-Class on the horizen. New engine series (280/350) has been a major plus. A fine sedan that has been around to have most kinks worked out. Interior design getting a bit dated compared to the BMW and Lexus.The Lexus and BMW are brand new platforms and both are appealing in distinct ways. I must say that the Lexus is designed for humans that are not much over 6'tall up front and ""Hobbit-like"" in the rear. Rear seat is useful only for your briefcase or groceries... in other words, practically useless.The BMW has a more friendly cabin size-wise and exemplifies the superb BMW driving traits of overall performance balance they are known for. Everything works in harmony (steering, braking, engine, handling) to deliver a terrific driving experience. The Lexus is its own interpretation of the BMW experience that may also appeal to you.That said, I'd certainly drive all three under conditions similar to your real-world requirements to develop your own opinion. Imagine living with each one and using in a manner that best reflects your needs... hauling additional people, kids, cargo, etc. Beyond that, imagine each of the three sitting in your driveway and determine which one most appeals to you given the right color and option combo.Also, bring a reference CD to test the sound system during your test-drive as well. I'm sure the total dealer and test-drive experience will help to tilt you in the right direction for you. "

You still have to live with whatever you select every day of those 4 years, so select what you really ""want"" to drive.The BMW will not cost you a cent to maintain for 4 years - not for brakes, windshield wiper inserts or oil changes. Not sure if the RF tires are an option, but BMW did tune the suspension for the firmer sidewall characteristics.The Lexus is just too small, but is a decent design and is a high quality piece.

"mikeinmd","May 2006"," Regarding pricing and value, specifically between Lexus IS and BMW 3 series, here is an example (from a reviewer) worth noting:  ""The IS 350 I drove, with $8,000 worth of Luxury Package, 18-inch wheels, Nav, and Mark Levinson audio, was $44,000. This suggests that Lexus is going toe-to-toe with BMW.  But this isn't really the case, because it doesn't take into account the significantly higher level of content on the IS. Even the base IS 250 with a price of $30,580 has leather, 10-way power seats, keyless access and ignition, a CD changer, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and metallic paint standard. All of these are optional on the BMW 325i. Adding just the leather, keyless system, and metallic paint to the BMW boosts its price, already $1,000 higher than that of the Lexus, to $3,400 higher than that of the Lexus. Adjusting for remaining feature differences boosts that gap even further, to $4,400. The gap is even larger, about $5,000, with the uplevel engines."" "
"blueguydotcom","May 2006"," Like I said, I ordered an 06 330i with 6 speed manual, leather, sport package, xenons, power seats/roof, comfort access (keyless ignition/entry) and pdc (park distance control) for less than 36k - MSRP of 41k. The exact car and color I wanted. Now, try going to Lexus and ordering an IS350 with the sport package and xenons. Best of luck on getting that car. When I visit the Lexus site it won't even show me a sport package equipped car. I called dealerships and they all offered to order the car for me - with a deposit and zero info on its delivery time. Better luck still getting that car in the exact color you want and for less than msrp. You're looking at over 39.7k - assuming a dealer will try to ""order"" (can't really order a Lexus) an IS350 for you that way. Of course he's gonna demand a deposit, it may take from 4-8 months to get the car and service isn't free (add at least another $1500 for service - brakes, oil changes, tune ups- over 45k miles).So, no the Lexus IS350 isn't in the same ballpark as a 330i as I wanted one. It wasn't even close. My 330i cost considerably less than the IS350 with sport/xenons, which if it ever arrived would have been crippled by an automatic transmission. "
"habitat1","May 2006"," With all due respect to those that might shop both the IS350 and 330i and make the decision based upon price, I think you're in the minority.Neither of these cars are inexpensive and the purchase decision is likely to be based upon personal preference, not a couple thousand dollars. With respect to the IS and 330, at least to me, they are very different in their driving character. I really don't think these cars are seriously cross shopped as much as this forum might suggest. Casually cross shopped, maybe. But if you prefer BMW handling, steering and driving dynamics, it's unlikely that 300 hp stuffed into an automatic sedan with a Lexus suspension is going to get you to switch your preference. And if you prefer Lexus interior aesthetics and ample electronic do dads, along with exceptional relability, you're probably not going to switch your preference to a more spartan drivers car.So, my guess is that the price/value debate is more of a friendly joust than a real factor for 90% of buyers. Lexus could sell the IS350 for $20k and I won't buy an automatic sport sedan. Not picking on Lexus - I wouldn't even buy the $85k M5 SMG for a similar discount. "
"blueguydotcom","May 2006"," Hey, I wouldn't have bought the lexus if it were 8k cheaper then my 330i. I hated the way it drove - zero roadfeel, numb steering, understeer, soft-suspension, etc. That it was more expensive and couldn't easily be ordered made it easy. "

Enough so that everyone who has ridden in or driven it comments favorably about the total experience... from acceleration to handling to steering and braking.

"kdshapiro","May 2006"," ""So please no more mountain, curvy, wavy road nonsense.""Obviously there are varying points of view out there. BMWs are not underpowered, I wouldn't think of the new M5 as being underpowered in any sense of the word. The M3 is not underpowered, the new twin turbo 335 isn't underpowered, the 330i is not underpowered nor is the 325.It doesn't seem like you have had the opportunity to really see what the 330i is capable of.

You can strap rockets to a soap box and get it to 60 faster than a Ferrari. BMW's philosophy has always been ""make the sespension faster than the car"". If you don't buy that ""nonsense"" then GM and Ford have lots of cars just for you. Has BMW ""fallen"" a couple of notches in power/acceleration? I don't think so. Others have tried to make 0-60 the metric of comparison. BMW makes a 5 passenger M5 that matches my 911S in straight line acceleration and runs circles around anything out of Japan in handling. The M3 that you ""absolutely love"" will still be a joy to drive for another 20 years, even if it's not the fastest car on the road then, just like a slower Ferrari 328 still is today. Mashing your foot into the floor of an overpowered, under-suspensioned automatic is a short lived thrill.

"dhanley","May 2006"," > That's my question for the BMW 3 series sedan as well as others in this discussion. Is handling everything?Not at all. Otherwise, we'd be driving elises, or we'd find some way to bring over an ariel atom.For me, what's great about the BMW is the overall balance. The handling is superb, yet the ride is not very harsh. Power is good, but the engine is not thrashy and the car still achieves good fuel economy. The car is roomy inside(you may argue this) yet it maintains a efficient outside package. The reliability is good. The interior is quite good. The resale is strong.IMO( again, just my opinion ) every other car in the category fails on at least one of these points, typically more, and for that reason, i wouldn't consider that car. The g35 gets bad fuel economy, the engine is thrashy, and it feels just a bit ponderous to me. The TL has nose-heavy FWD handling. The CTS has a pretty bad interior. The a4 is very nose heavy and the back seat is tight. All IMO and not reasons someone else shouldn't consider that car.

In addition, there was some commentary on the apparent ""slowness"" of the M3. Some of the hp issues will most likely be a non-issue with the arrival of the 335.

I'm currently looking at 2003 statistics and the U.S.A. actually has a very small edge in that we suffer roughly 9.4 fatalities per one billion kilometers driven versus 9.7 in Germany. That having been said, those statistics are for ALL roads in the referenced country. When you limit the statistics to just the ""Motorway"", the U.S.A. suffers 5.2 fatalities per one billion kilometers while Germany slides in at 3.8, a reduction of 27%.Over the years I've read lots of reports from lots of sources and the closest that I've ever heard (from an anti-autobahn group no less) was about 20% fewer fatalities than the U.S. per given distance.

High speed runs are for empty roads, clear line of sight, ideal conditions, etc. I maintain that the above behavior is a LOT safer than a soccer mom/dad yakking on their cell oblivious to what's happening around them. dave "
"louiswei","June 2006"," I agree with you that people should drive at the speed limit but I also think that the speed limit shouldn't be at 55 mph. I don't know what you drive but my car is just not designed to go 55 mph. In order to obey the speed limit I'll have to concentrate so hard on my speedometer which causes distractions and further endanger myself and other drivers. "

"blueguydotcom","June 2006"," Wow, talk about picking a random, isolated bit of the driving experience. I'm talking about open freeways, not bits of road locked into city planning errors. Logically, if one is driving an expressway that was designed in such a fashion and the speed limit is 50 (isn't that just a road? - 50 mph is slower than most of the normal roadways upon which I grew up driving), then yes someone doing 80 is outlandish.On the flipside, the I-15 corridor to Vegas is desolate for over 150 miles. It's nothing but dirt and road. Same with 350+ miles of I-5 between Valencia and SF/Sac.Just 15 minutes ago I drove out of Kansas City to the airport. Two to three lane freeway. It's 4:30-5 am. Repeatedly I was forced to pass on the right because jerks in the left lane felt they didn't need to move to the right for faster moving traffic. I was only doing 80 for god's sake! - on freeways with speeds ranging from 65 to 70. These selfish drivers could clearly see me approach. They couldn't have missed my slowing, flashing of my high beams, waiting, flashing and eventual circumvention of their inconsiderate driving. Yes, inconsiderate. If one is in the ""fast"" lane, a car is approaching from behind and it's safe to move right, then one, as a considerate driver, should move to the right post haste. It's that simple. Courteous, concientious drivers do this. The vast majority of drivers in the USA do not operate their vehicles in that manner. They feel entitled to any lane they pick. They merge in the same manner - speed limit is 65 and they get on the freeway at 55...then complain everybody drives too fast.Argh...Can't wait to get home. Hopefully my e90 has arrived and I can have some fun in the hills this weekend. "

Plain and simple.Accidents on highways (in MOST cases) are not caused by excessive speed, they're caused by INATTENTIVE drivers, worrying about their cell phone, rubber-necking at the car stuck in the median, putting on make-up, brushing their teeth (I've seen this more than once), or reading the paper (seen this countless times too), and NOT concentrating on the SOLE purpose of getting behind the wheel in the first place, to DRIVE!But I digress...

My brother owns a 330I and has owned BMW for the last 10 years. I have read at least 50 reviews on both these cars and after test driving both cars I have to tell you the majority of reviews are bologny! I initially was sold on the BMW until I saw the interior and recognized the car had absolutely no giddie up. Afterwards I checked out the IS 350. My favorite features on this car is the backup camera, tight handling, acceleration, luxury refinements, sporty but smooth ride. When you open up the ashtray or the sunvisor everything just moves so smoothly. Very impressive!!!!!!!Eventually I decided o get the IS 350 since IMO it provided the best combination of sport/luxury/looks. Handling feel definitely goes to BMW, but the handling on the IS 350 is just as tight also great just with not much feedback. After driving my car a few times and experiencing the driving amenities and overall package of the IS 350 my brother now has buyer remorse and seriously contemplating trading in his BMW 330I for and IS. Friends just don't believe every reviewer and takes anyone opinions as facts after all its all just an opinion. Make sure you test drive numerous cars in what ever segment your looking at Had I not done that I would have settled for the 330I and my brother would not be experiencing buyers remorse right now.

I want a purposeful interior that's got the gauges I need, hard, tight leather seats, an ergonomics focused on the driver. The 46 had it, the e90 is a step away but not nearly as bad as the competition. Give me the hard edged teutonic designs over anything buicky-soft (Infiniti, Lexus, Acura, Caddy). "
"louiswei","June 2006"," I don't know how Lexus dealers in San Diego function but dealers here in the Southeast do take special orders. I know this because I just purchased a new IS. My dealer explained to me that if you can't find anything you like on the lot there are 3 ways to obtain a car of your preference:1. Trade with other dealers (the simplest). Dealers usually trade car at port right after they arrived. For my region the port the Jacksonville.2. Request the car before they shipped out. This is not custom-build, instead the dealers request the car right after they rolled out of the assembly line. If dealers don't have special request then it's up to Lexus to distribute the cars.3. Customer-build. This option takes the longest (usually up to 120 days) and yes you can customize your car. The story I heard is that Lexus rarely builds IS with sports package and the only way to get it is through special order.As for the color, like I said the color options Lexus offered is plenty enough for me and also, Lexus doesn't charge extra for paint colors other than while, red and black like BMW does.

I've been researching and checking the interiors on these cars, meaning the dash layouts, instrumentation, even the styling contours of the seats.

Acura TL: Love the interior looks of this  car all the way from the electric blue  instrumentation, the entire dash layout, and I think the contour of the front bucket seats are gorgeous. Right now, the only thing I wish the TL had was the auto-headlights and split fold rear seat. The current Nissan Maxima: The fact that my 2002 Maxima has been an excellent car for  four years would probably always keep this car on my radar. I know the styling to  many people out there is subjective  inside and out on this car, but I still like  it.  Lexus IS250/350: It's a beautiful car, but.. It's just too small for my tastes. BMW 325/330: While I really like the  exterior styling, especially with the sport package, i.e., wider tires and such, I really am not crazy about the interior dash layout/ design. It's what keeps this car down on the list for me. I really feel that the previous generation 3 series had a much better looking dash layout/design. The Infiniti G35/coupe: Love these cars, but not crazy about the mpg's with today's gas prices. I'd rather get the TL or the Maxima with a little bit less hp and more mpg's. Just my two cents! "

The Infiniti ads are the same way. They want ridiculous amounts for a down payment on a lease. I get so P.O.'d when I see this every weekend.

Why the blazes would I care if someone can get 1500 over US invoice on a car? That's a lousy deal. In the end that wouldn't help terribly much with a lease (some but not alot). I'm talking v. MSRP it's a 14-15% savings.On the lease side, you also have to consider that you will be paying for at least a month that your car is on a boat or the portYou also get one month free from BMW. Add it up on a two year lease and it's a ridiculous savings. Yes, you pay a month without the car. I assume that month is covered by the BMWCCA rebate (and then some if it's a 5 series which gets a 1k rebate). More than the monetary savings you get a chance to do things with your car that a minute fraction have ever experienced. How many people can say they've motored along on the road legally at over 140 mph? In their own car? The car that's now sitting in the garage? My god, I may find my 330i ZSP boring as all hell (which gives you a hint at my distaste for the rest of this segment) but I have the fondest memories of that car and roaring through the alps, cruising through monaco, blasting down the autostrada, gliding along the french coast and of course streaking across Germany. For me, that will always be priceless. When I think about my stupid low lease on my car and how people are paying 550, 600, 650 for a 330i, it almost makes me like the car. "

It's important to not make the people who bought 330's just a year ago rue their purchase or to leave BMW with a mass of off-lease cars selling below their residuals. BMW seems to be working very hard at maintaining their position as a top-tier premium manufacturer while still having an attainable entry-level car. It does seems like a difficult line to walk.

"louiswei","July 2006"," Why? The 335i was a known factor over a year ago. No, the 335i was NOT a known factor a year ago. In fact, the current 06' 330i only came out a little over a year ago. The 335i rumor didn't surface until around March/April this year if my recollection is right.Hmm, don't see how. The Is350 doesn't compare to even a 325i, let alone something like the 335i.Exactly, the IS350 isn't comparable to the underpower 325i, the IS250 is a better candidate, both on price and performance. Oh yeah by the way, just in case you haven't figure out why BMW decided to go with the 335i after only one year into the E90 cycle: the 330i is underpowered comparing to the IS350 and G35. They need a product that's fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again. Although I am not a fan of the current 3's design I'll have to say that BMW did a great job with the 335i. The twin turbo will give it the speed that it was lacking and with BMW's superior handling no doubt the 335i will the ""undisputed"" leader of this segment again.not much of a comparison. The IS350's fast and that's it.I see it as a very good comparison. Here are my predictions of the comparison.Handling: hands down BMWAcceleration: Draw with a slight advantage toward the IS350 (Edmund's first drive clocked the 335i coupe at 5.6 sec from 0-60. However, the sedan version no doubt will be heavier so 5.6 is probably the BEST that it'll be able to do. I predict the 0-60 time for the sedan will be around 5.7, 5.8 sec)Interior/Luxurious: hands down LexusSo again, we are back at the same conclusion as earlier: if you want handling, get a Bimmer; if you want Luxurious, get the Lexus.PS. The 07' IS350 will come with the VDIM off button so it'll be interesting to see how does the comparison play out due to this factor (It's not like one can't turn off the VDIM before, they just choose to ignore it). "
"dewey","July 2006"," 335i drawback: No availability of either a sedan or touring version .A coupe provides lousy space efficinency with little gain in performance/handling. If I want a space inefficient car I will stick with a nimble and light two seater instead. "
"kdshapiro","July 2006"," ""So again, we are back at the same conclusion as earlier: if you want handling, get a Bimmer; if you want Luxurious, get the Lexus.""You're right a comparison is wasted. Not to mention that once the mags (read:C&D) get their hands on the car and apply their proprietary algorithms to determine true 0-60 we'll be all over the map again.Although not in the same price range, the upper end of the 3-series sedans should put to rest any concern on BMW 3 series performance.At 40K+ neither of these cars are entry level.

"louiswei","July 2006"," I think BMW will have a winner in 335i if they are able to manage not to raise the price too much (say less than $1000 from the current 330i). I am also sure that one will be able to find both the IS350 and 330i at below 40k if choose not to get all those high tech toys. Still though, you are right, with any additional options these are easily 40k+ cars. As for C&D, I can't wait to see what kind of ridiculous 0-60 time they'll have for the 335i. My first guess is: 4.9 sec. :surprise: "
"blueguydotcom","July 2006","  The 335i rumor didn't surface until around March/April this year if my recollection is right.Your recollection is wrong. Back in June of 05 people were already talking about the turbo engine from BMW. On bimmerfest the war had already broken out between the 3.5 people and the turbo people. Everybody knew a bigger 300 HP engine was on the way for 07. Exactly, the IS350 isn't comparable to the underpower 325i the IS250 is a better candidate, both on price and performance. No, the IS250 is quite simply a joke. All around sad. It's slow, expensive, cannot be ordered to specific specs without great trouble and has lousy handling. The Is350 is the same. Thus, i wrote exactly what I intended, the IS350 can't even compare to a lowly e90 (or e46) 325i.  They need a product that's fast enough to make the 3 series a class benchmark again. BMW has never been the fastest in their segment. They don't sell cars based on 0-60 times.Acceleration: Draw with a slight advantage toward the Again, this isn't a BMW thing. The 325i e90 on a track will devour the IS350 all day long. No need to be faster off the line if you can take a corner at a much higher rate of speed.Interior/Luxurious: hands down LexusI disagree. The Lexus interior is too soft and small. It's plush, coddling and worst of all you can't see anything out of the rear windows. And you can't order it to specs.  So again, we are back at the same conclusion as earlier: if you want handling, get a Bimmer; if you want Luxurious, get the Lexus.I believe this area is the entry level performance sedans...thus the Lexus fails for many reasons (some already mentioned):Lack of manual - the automanual in the lexus is a piece of steaming dog vomit. It's extremely slow to react - like all automanuals. Try a double downshift at 65 mph...the automanual allows it after a several second delay. Lack of ordering ability. you cannot order an IS350 as you desire. Talk to a lexus dealership. want it with xenons and that's it? Good luck. You have to wait and wait and Lexus may never build the car you want. You simply cannot order the car as you want it.Maintenance - the IS350 will cost money to maintain over a 3 year lease. Not so the BMW. BTW, turning off the VDIM won't change the loose handling, vague roadfeel, body rolls and in-general soft design of the buick-like IS350. "

A segment leader must contain both the performance and luxury. if this is simply entry peformance sedan segment then we can add cars like Mazda6, EVO, Impreza into discussion.Lack of manualA manual maybe a priority for you but that may not be so important to the majority. We gotta keep in mind that not everyone buys cars in this segment is an ethusiast. Many average Joe (like me) just want a car that's fast enough and feel comfortable driving it. We also don't want a manual since it's very likely we'll be stuck in traffic everyday while going to work and getting home. In fact for me the interior refinement is more important than a manual transmission.Lack of ordering abilityMy suggestion is...go to another dealer because when I bought my IS, my dealer allows special order (you'll just need to wait 3-4 months, that's it). Xenon wasn't a stand-alone option for the 06' MY and that's why you can't just get Xenon by itself.

"blueguydotcom","August 2006"," You got a great deal and the best that ED would have saved you might have been an additional 5-6%. There were other circumstances - emotional decisions essentially. I set foot on the lot May 22nd intent on ordering my 330i to spec. They were busy that day. I went home and thought about the ZHP I saw on the lot. The next morning I returned and asked if they had another ZHP. They did: silver gray in the back. It was untouched, the plastic still encasing the car, cardboard within the interior. We tore out the plastic and I drove the car. They told me $400 over invoice. I did the math on 10 MSDs over the base MF buy rate. Emotions took over. I didn't want to wait for the car - I had been driving a Jetta 1.8T that I desperately wanted out of. The ED deal was attractive and would have meant several thousand dollars in savings over the lease period. But I'd have to hold onto my current Jetta - which was killing me with its awfulness. I opted to pay more for the car I had driven and took the 330i ZHP that day. It was purely emotional and not the least bit rational.When my lease was coming up on the 2003 I spent several months test driving the competition again. Still nobody built a car as nice as my e46 ZHP - including the 06 e90 ZSP. My 03 ZHP was not an option - a myriad of electrical and mechanical problems BMW could not fix.Defeated, I opted to follow-through on the e90 ED lease, opting for a quick two-year lease. The cost was obscenely low, the car's still more fun than any of its competition (though a shadow of the e46 ZHP's fun) and it gave me a good excuse to go to Europe to see an ex-girlfriend and drive through Europe. The car's boring but the trip was awesome.Perhaps by 08 BMW will have a decent, fun car available. If not, maybe the competition will have finely created something fun.

The ergonomics - window controls are placed wrong, center stack isn't canted toward the driver, dual HVAC5. Slower6. Long throws of the 6 speed7. Higher ride height8. Car is taller, thus higher seating position (closer to a G35 now, no longer sports car low seating position)9. Less efficient engine10. Muted steering11. Extremely quiet ride12.

My prediction is if there aren't anything dramatic happening the 335i will continue to lead the field until the next generation of performance sedans come out (2010 maybe?).However, I am interesting to see how this HP war is going to play out. There is got to have an end for this because if not, 5 years from now we'll be looking at bunch of performance sedans with close to 400 HP :surprise: with sticker price pushing $50K. I really hope Lexus, Infiniti and even Acura to concentrate on improving their handlings in order to compete with BMW instead of trying to make some insane engine.

"habitat1","August 2006"," Thanks for the e90 vs. e46 review. I do think the e90 has been successful in the marketplace because many of the things that bother you (and would me) go right over the head of a lot of non-enthusiast drivers. Some of them are actually preferred - bigger, quieter, heavier.But I hope BMW doesn't forget that enthusiasts gave BMW much of it's brand equity. If everyone was happy with 4,000 lb A4 Quatros and 300-hp Buick - I mean Lexus - IS350's, there wouldn't be much need for a BMW brand at all.Some purists even feel Porsche went too far in taking the edge off the beloved 993 model 911 when they introduced the 996. Fortunately the 997, while being a good daily driver, puts back some of that precision and feel.Good luck in your hunt for a 911. I don't think Porsche and BMW are mutually exclusive in our house, but it would be tough to justify replacing a sedan (TL) that I'm only driving 25% of the time now. "
"graphicguy","August 2006"," But, some of the reasons some of you didn't buy a BMW e-90 are the same reasons I did......--bigger--more refined--perferred the new interior over the old--quieter (at least until you get up in the rev range where it's every bit as smooth....maybe smoother)That's not to say I didn't like the e-46. I just liked the e-90 better. "
"louiswei","August 2006"," Hmm...for me I like the e46 better than E90. Reasons:1. Better exterior style (BMW, please sent Bangle packing, pleasessssssss)2. Driver oriented interior design.I would definitely consider a 3 as my next car if BMW doesn't use the Bangle design anymore and implementing a more refined interior like the E46's. "
"dhanley","August 2006"," It's amazing how varied taste is. I picked an e36 over the e46 because of how much i disliked the e46 exterior. I thought it looked bland, like a bar of soap, and very feminine.I was sort of ""meh"" on the e90's appearance for awhile, but i quite like the looks of it now. I am also pleased with the new refinement and slightly bigger size. The interior is also a step up, i think, except that is is less driver focused. I'm not at all a fan of the runflats, and i didn't like HP/torue bias of the non-turbo 3.0L. The 3.0T fixes the torque issue in a big way, however. dave "

Contrast that with the convenience compromises of an auto transmissionThere is no convenience, IMHO. I travel often for work so i'm stuck driving autos quite often. Never a good thing, in my view. Never. I can be in LA bumper-to-bumper and I'd pick a manual. Gliding, controling the engine, very little braking, etc all make driving a manual more engaging and easier for me. automatics make driving difficult, spotty and dependent on a computer's guess of what you want.

Yes, I transport people in the backseat. Probably a few times a week. The backseat in the e46, in my eyes, was too commodious. The e90 is ridiculously large all the way around. too wide, too tall, too much interior space. If they'd go back to making BMWs the size of the e30 I'd be a happy, happy boy. The car is just too small for my lifestyle.Too big for mine, too small for yours. What exactly are you transporting? My mom had sports cars my whole life. As kids we road in the back of her Z28: trips, swim practice soccer carpools, etc. Even in high school we could fit in that car. Zero trunk space, tiny buckets, etc and we were fine. More importantly mom was happy. Of course now that she doesn't need a ""family"" car she's got a Miata and a 55 T-bird for her daily drivers. Shrug.

"tayl0rd","August 2006"," blueguydotcom, I'm confused as to why you would even buy a 3-series. You're complaining that it's too big and too spacious. Why didn't you opt for a Z28, Trans Am, or Mustang GT? You would have had a faster car right off the bat, and you could put some stout, reliable aftermarket suspension pieces on to make any one of them perform way better than a 3-series. And even after changing suspension bits, you'd still be several thousand under the cost of a 3-series. :confuse: Are you truly a ""driving enthusiast"" or did you just buy into the brand cachet? Because for the price of the 3-series, there are so many other cars that can do what you claim to prefer so much better for so much less money, i.e. 350Z, S2000, Mustang GT, Z28, Trans Am, (heck, Miata!), WRX STi, EVO IX, et al. And for the same investment of money, any one of those cars would absolutely annihilate a 3-series on a track, M3 or otherwise. :surprise: Why the BMW? The interior? Now you're into pretty much the same reason(s) that other people prefer the newer 3-series, myself included. I like the bigger size, nicer interior, and smoother lines of the new one. On a similar note, I've driven a new 330i SP and if that's what you call too smooth and refined, I'd hate to drive one of the older ones. :surprise: It was noisy, not plush at all, and stiff as a buckboard. That's fine for my Mustang GT (which isn't noisy at all), but if I'm spending 40 large on a luxury nameplate, there'd better be some luxury in it as well as more size; which is why I'm eyeballing the 550i.

"laurasdada","August 2006"," Poodog and Blueguy are both absoulutely correct. For themselves. And therein lies the rub. The car that you buy is the best for you! No one can argue that point. Only you can say, ""Ooops. I goofed. Shoulda bought the TL/3 because for me it would have been the better car...""I tend to agree with Poodog's post. Including driving an auto. For most of my life I drove sticks (learned on a 4 speed Saab 99, if I remember...), VW Scirocco, Mitsu Mirage Turbo, Acura Integra, Nissan Sentra SE-R (very poor man's, me, BMW 2002!) Saab 900-all sticks. But for me, commuting in the Boston area just took all the joy out of a manual (I actually taught the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her the Saab 900 so that I could enjoy it on the weekends, but she too grew tired of rowing her own during her commute and like all women now drives an RX300). I may indeed return to the manny tranny fold, never say never. But for now, to me the TL offered the best balance/value of all the attributes important to me, including FWD. Which, all things being equal (or even not equal?), I have found to be superior in the snow to RWD. 30 years of ski trips to the mountains of New England have proved it over and over to me.Blueguy?

The others simpyl can't.Ergonomics - only Audi comes close.Maintenance - BMW is the only one to offer free maintenance so they win automatically there.Pricing - 35.7k for my 330i with sport, xenons, leather, pdc, comfort access, RWD and 6 speed manual. Only the G35 comes close as it offers a 6 speed, RWD, comfort acces and xenons. CTS and C Class can be had with manual and RWD but they're boring cars on every level and no match for the Infiniti or BMW models. In the world of the IS, A4, Mazdaspeed6, Legacy, they lose because they either lack RWD or a manual. RWD - that discounts all FWD and AWD cars. MSRP is the only true baseline to go on.I view invoice as the baseline - start there and go up. And in the case of BMW I view ED invoice. Again, it's all subjective. I tried all the competition.

"graphicguy","August 2006"," tayl0rd.....your (and my previous) Mustang does what it does very well, as we both know. It does it at an unbelievable price, to boot.However, there is an apples to kumquats difference when comparing a Mustang to a BMW 3 Series.You and I both went through the Mustang GT vs the GTO wars. What we came away with was there was more to the Mustang than just a few 10ths 0-60 times and using a solid rear axle vs IRS. All that said, we know what won out in the end.....Mustang continues to sell well and the GTO is now defunct.Like you, I like the bigger size and more refinement & luxury of the 3 Series e90. Some call it ""blasphemy"" though. I also it depends on what some would call ""plush"". While I really like the e90's near ideal balance of lux and performance, there are those that feel BMW ""sold their soul"" in bringing it out, however. Fact is,you're right. If someone is spending $35K-$40K for an e90, it better embody lux and refinement elements.As far as your ""stiff ride"" experience with the e90, you may have driven one with the Bridgestone run flat tires. I purposely bought mine with Continental tires. The difference in ride/handling is night and day. From most reports, those Bridgestone runflats are garbage. They provide a buckboard ride, are noisier than the Continentals and seem to not be a well suited match to the suspension of the e90. "
"tayl0rd","August 2006"," Hmmm...Interesting info on the Bridgestones (and they felt like bridge stones, too! :P ) I'll have to give the 330i SP a second drive with different tires and see if I come away with a different opinion. Hopefully so because it sure is nice. "
"graphicguy","August 2006"," tayl0rd....I orginally drove a 3 series with the bridgestone run flats. I remember telling the sales guy after hitting a very moderate pot hole....""I think this thing's got a busted shock"". Of course, it didn't, but those tires really punish on anything other than relatively smooth pavement. They were loud on concrete, too. The 2nd test drive, at a different dealer, felt like a different car. Firm, yet supple, ride. It would shoot through the twisties almost telepathically and at speeds I wouldn't dare run in most other cars.Finished the test drive and looked at the tires....sure enough they were different....they were the continentals.I didn't buy the one I test drove, but told the sales person from the 2nd test drive that in order to make a sale, he'd have to find one for me that had the Continentals. Fortunately, I think the ones produced later in the year came with Continentals since he had more '06 330is with continentals than he did with Bridgestones.Mine had only 10 miles on it when I bought it so it was probably produced later in the model year.

Every Mercedes SLR McLaren comes with a five-speed automatic. Where the high end goes, the rest of the industry eventually follows. And the way this is going, the clutch pedal is doomed"" I love it when a poster says the BMW is too big and should be lighter, only include a manual, and have no special electronics. BMW is not making cars for you! They are making it for the professional that likes the image and wants a bigger, safer car with bells and whistles. So you know where I am coming from I sold an A4 for an IS. I loved the Audi and the Lexus is exceeding my expectations. The Lexus is more luxurious, and feels more sporty at times. The Audi was a great execution of simplicity and just did what it needed to do well. Preference - I don't have one yet, but the Lexus is exceeding the hype for me. For those that think of Lexus as just a Toyota (or Infiniti is just a Nissan) - stop being a snob. Is a Lamborghini just a VW/Audi? Cars should be (many other examples) judged on their own merits.End of Rant. "
"louiswei","August 2006"," I would have not looked at any Lexus until the IS. Man I couldn't say it better. I always thought Lexus was for old people and it has no character and totally lacks styles...until the IS came along. I was so impressed I made it the first car I bought by myself. So far I am very satisfy with it and it definitely does NOT suck.Also, I totally agree with you on the manual tranny. Lexus estimated they'll sale 70% IS250 and 30% IS350 (so far they're right on target) and about 25% of the 3 series sold were manual. By using those numbers, if Lexus puts manual on the 350 that'll consist about 7.5% of the total IS sale numbers. To Lexus that number is really not that significant and they might figure it's better not to produce manual 350 in order to cut production cost.However, I do believe that if Lexus really want to be a serious player in the performance sedan field they'll have to put manual tranny on their cars in order to shut those people up. Even of it's only availabe through special order. "
"shipo","August 2006"," ""However, I do believe that if Lexus really want to be a serious player in the performance sedan field they'll have to put manual tranny on their cars in order to shut those people up.""I suppose that's one way of putting it, however, as the IS350 doesn't have a manual gearbox, it won't even make my ""long list"". The reality for many of us is that we want a 4-Door RWD car with a manual transmission, good handling, good power and a back seat that isn't a joke for adults to ride in (the back seat in the IS is such a joke that my kids couldn't even fit). The ""G"" meets those criteria, so too do both the 3-Series and the 5-Series. Geez, even Cadillac has one (CTS, not my cup-o-tea looks wise) as does stodgy old Mercedes-Benz (C350 Sport). Why can't Lexus do it?Best Regards,Shipo "
"louiswei","August 2006"," I think IS350 is going to get a manual tranny sooner or later (maybe during the mid-life upgrade in 08'?). As for the backseat I'd agree with you, it is too small. However, I think Lexus purposely made the backseat of the IS smaller so it won't hurt ES's sales.One needs to realize that Lexus currently has two entry level sedans in IS and ES unlike the other brands. Since they know the ES will sell well no matter what as long as they put enough goodies in there. Thus, they have the luxury to experiment with the IS. One thing that puzzles me, I wonder what's Lexus' intended demography for the IS? "
"kdshapiro","August 2006"," ""One needs to realize that Lexus currently has two entry level sedans in IS and ES""Yes and no, mostly no. The ES 350 starts at 33K msrp. The IS 250 starts at 31K MSRP. So for almost the same price you get one car with a 3.5 liter engine and one car with a 2.5 liter engine. The IS350 is significantly more expensive. They are not the same cars (furthering the thought the ES 350 is a rebadged CAMRY). Most car manufacturers have some overlap with the price in their product lines as well.In reality the ES350 is a top of the line CAMRY, while the IS250 is a bottom of the line IS. "
"louiswei","August 2006"," The IS350 is significantly more expensiveNot really.Top of the line ES350: $44,774.00Top of the line IS350: $41,139.00IS350 has a higher MSRP than the ES but once you added all the goodies (most ES's do) the ES is priced higher than the IS350.From this we can see Lexus' strategy to have 2 entry level sedans in their lineup. ES will attract buyers whom have families and are looking for a comfortable and luxurious ride (there are a lot of them out there, in fact, more than the so called enthusiasts). IS is aiming for...I don't know, semi-enthusiasts (or so called poseur by some of you)? "
"merc1","August 2006"," An ES350 can run 44K? Yikes!M "
"kdshapiro","August 2006"," ""The IS350 is significantly more expensive""You're playing the option game. The IS350 is $5K more msrp, starting at $36K, than the 250. From what you post it is obvious that Lexus let's you option out the ES350 more heavily than the IS350.ES350 - $11K in options.IS350 - $5K in options.The IS350 is $3K more expensive then ES350 according to Lexus website.So that even furthers my contention the ES350 is a top of the line CAMRY. It is true Lexus does have 3 models of cars and two platforms within $5K base price of one another, but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an IS with the rear seat of an ES. It's like saying the MiniCooper and 325 are two entry level sedans within BMWs lineup.That's about the difference between the ES and IS. "
"louiswei","August 2006"," Please read my post before replying some random stuff...According to the Lexus website, a TOP OF THE LINE ES is more expensive than the IS. All what I was trying to say is Lexus has 2 entry level sedans aiming at different market demographic. THAT'S IT. Why you think Lexus let you option out the ES more heavily? Because they are aiming at the customers whom are looking for more luxury.At least the ES and IS belong to the same segment (entry lux), the MINI and your beloved 3er are not (not even close). 3er: entry luxMINI: subcompact?but there is no mistaking the rear seat of an IS with the rear seat of an ESDidn't you read my previous post?

I agree that the IS is not for you, but I would argue that Lexus and many other manufactures are willing to give up those sales. Lexus can do it - they choose not to. It makes their cars better for some and worst for others. Clearly the IS is not for people who carry 4 people often. It is for people that prefer coupes, but want/need the benefit of a sedan. I rarely have anyone in the back seat (one every few months), but it is nice to have it as extra storage. The rear doors help with utilizing the space for many reasons. Think of it as a roomier execution of the RX-8 concept. If one needs a full family car - then Lexus offers the ES and GS. I have had multiple people in my back seat as everyone wants a ride in the new car so the backseat is just fine for lunch trips, etc. I think people make too big a deal about the size unless they need a full size sedan. A lot of single or married (no/small kids) professionals that do not need a roomey back seat. Why would Lexus make the 350 have a manual? Retool and add the extra cost for maybe 5% more sales. Does that make economic sense? Time will tell if Lexus has judged the market correctly. If they have solid (does not have to be industry best) sales then they have targeted correctly. Early results are positive. Keep in mind, car makers are in business to sell cars - not satisfy a minority of posters. That is why the IS250 automatic will be the best seller in the lineup. I believe as stated in a previous post (reinforced by Edmunds article) that manuals are a dying breed. I had several through the years and have no desire to use a clutch ever again.The great thing is that there are a lot of good choices. If manual and a large engine is your thing then you can have a great car. Lexus will not mourn loosing you. I also believe (don't have the statistics) that automatics have a better resale since they are more desirable. Same as having leather.Enjoy whatever car you choose. "
"shipo","August 2006"," One of the many problems that I have with the IS is that it was originally touted by Lexus management as their answer to the 3-Series.

The first couple months they'll be sell at sticker and after that they'll be SLIGHTLY discounted like the current IS does.

Sure it was only $600 below MSRP but that's still a discount.This reminds me of the yahoos saying the BMW 335i won't sell below MSRP yet we've already seen people getting them for $1250 over invoice at Bimmerfest.

"jzalkin","August 2006"," 1) Is the Lexus IS large enough to be USED as a sedan on a regular basis? Yes. Most of these cars suck if you have 4 full size adults that need to use the seat often.

One couldn't shut up about how great the car is.2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine? Yes, in my book since I would not buy a manual. Fast is fast however it gets there. My A4 had zero gears (CVT) and I would say that it was a performance sedan. It comes in a manual, but why would I care since I would not by one. Is the SLR not a sports car? It only comes in an automatic. 3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?""

"jzalkin","August 2006"," Here it is. I will call you out as an idiot and you will be ridiculed by all if you argue against the basic points.Point 1: All of these cars (3 series, IS, G35, C Class, CTS, TL) belong in this group. Some are newer and some are getting long in the tooth, but they all are competition. If a lot off people cross shop a model then it IS competition. If only a few then it is not. I bet almost everyone looked at a few of these model before selecting their car.Point 2: Different is good. It leads to choices and ability to get the best fit for them. Some difference help and some hurt. Sales will determine if a model is a success. Point 3: Just because YOU want a feature - does not make it the end all be all definition. Just because you think a car should have a manual does not mean everyone else does. Just because the TL is not RWD, does not mean it does not belong. Get over yourself - you are not the resident expert. You are just like the rest of us posting nothing more than your OPINION. If you will only drive a manual then I guess that matters to YOU. Since the vast majority of people (BMW buyers included) do not drive a manual - that is not a criteria for selection. I could not see anyone saying ""I want an automatic, but I won't look at the IS since the 350 does not offer a manual."" Does anyone else see the absurdity of this argument?Point 4: Berating others is childish just makes you look like and idiot. Enough said.Point 5: No one car is the overall best. One may be best given certain criteria, but another criteria will put another car on top. -----------I picked the IS for me. Came down to the BMW and I just didn't like it as much.

And actually last night at a party me and my coworker picked up two blondes who were about 5 6"" 5 7"" and they fitted fine no complaints. Actually they sweated all aspects of the car from the navitgation, to the bluetooth, handsfree keyless entry, push button start. elegant interior, interior lighting, sound system.2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine? I initially was adamant about getting a manual and was quite disappointed when I found out the IS will only be offered in auto. But, the auto in the IS is quick. Some people(blueguydot.com constantly post the shifting is slow in the IS. I disagree, I find it very nimble and if you read most reviews, reviewers agree.  3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?""

I'm not qualified to anser this question because I've never sat in the back of a new generation IS.2) Does a small sedan qualify for the ""Performance"" moniker if it only offers a manual transmission on its most anemic engine?Toyota/Lexus has A LOT more money then BMW does. Even if a manual IS350 was to only make up a small percentage of sales, they could make a business case for it. An IS350 with a stick (and no doubt a MUCH sportier suspension) would get a lot of good press. 3) Based upon the pre-release Lexus marketing hype along with the pre-release rhetoric from Lexus management about the IS being a true 3-Series competitor, ""Has the IS lived up to its pre-release billing or is it something of a joke?""NO, it has not lived up to its marketing hype. Lexus really got me excited about this car. There are some BMW drivers out there who are dissatisfied with their 3ers for one reason or another whether it be a horrible service department, electrical problems... (on the flip side there are MANY who are extremely pleased with not only how their cars drive, but how well they run). Lexus has an impeccable reputation for customer service & quality. If they could take a small percentage of BMW owners away from their stick shift, sports package equipped 3ers they'd build on a performance reputation that will only help them grow more. How about people moving up from 6 speed, V6 Honda Accords who are ""afraid"" of buying a German car? There is definitely a market for an IS350 manual w/ sportier suspension.I'll admit that acceleration was blistering when I drove the 300+ horsepower IS350 at a LEXUS driving event. The suspension was sloppy & floaty, the steering felt way too light and disconnected to the road. The brakes were touchy & artificial feeling. The lack of a manual tranmission made it even harder to swallow. The 330iA (255hp version) equipped with Sports Package & Slushbox felt much more alive in my hands. I jumped in and it felt like the car was my own. YOu definitely felt the power deficit of the BMW. The steering was spot on. Handling was neutral. The BMW felt light on its feet. The brakes were strong and easy to modulate. "

"graphicguy","August 2006"," kd....I'm on a different side of the fence regarding the interior of the 3 Series compared to the IS. When shopping, I also wandered over to the Audi store since they were offering A6Q's for $9K off MSRP. I liked the Audi interior the best. Their reputation for making the best interiors in the Premium end is well-deserved.I always do the ""knuckle wrap"" test on interior surfaces. No matter where I tapped in the 3 Series, it was clear BMW used high quality, well put together parts. The whole car, from the doors to the dash, had a ""bank vault-like"" feel. Plus, the wood was more abundant and better looking in the 3 Series than in the IS (whose wood looked like plastic, IMHO).Didn't get that same result with the IS on the knuckle wrap test.Don't get me wrong, I thought the Lexus interior was nice. The BMW had more of an understated elegance to it in comparison, though (as did the Audi). But, that's not the real reason we buy BMWs....it's the drive, ride, performance of the cars that gets us.Breifly looked at the CTS...not bad, but I always qualified it with the adder...NOT BAD FOR GM. There was still a lot of large expanses of plastic. And the knuckle test didn't do much to float my boat, either. "
"kdshapiro","August 2006"," I think we have the same general opinion. When I test drove the top end CTS (not the V), I thought Caddy did a great job on the interior, ok ride and ok exterior.The interior was soothing. Which after the drive led me to the following observation about interiors and interior color: Understated interior look best in dark colors, while overstated interiors look best in lighter colors. "
"habitat1","August 2006"," Well, IMO I think the only people qualified to say that driving a SMG/DSG Porsche, AMG, M and (especially) Ferrari isn't serious sport are: 1. Race car drivers 2. Fighter pilots 3. Astronauts I wonder which group does habitat1 belong to?None of the above. But I do have a functioning left foot and right hand, and prefer using both in a sports sedan or sports car. Note, I did not say a million dollar Formula One race car. Which is capable of 4+ G's in flat out tight turns and, as such, places a premium on having both hands on the wheel. I'm pretty sure that most race car drivers would prefer an SMG at Monaco rather than having to do multiple sets of 100 lb arm curls like they used to in the 70's. But from the SMG/DSG cars I've driven, that don't require forearms like Arnold to control, I find SMG/DSG's to take away too much from the direct control and fun to drive experience. For the record, I had my opinion in 1978 when I bought my first new car (a $4,000 Datsun B210 GX 4-speed). And when we bought our 1995 Nissan Maxima SE 5-speed (which we still own with 155k miles). So the fact that I am now fortunate enough to own a 911 didn't change either my opinion on manual transmssions or of my own intelligence. I'm just as dumb and stubborn now as I've always been.

I know the human eye is more precise than we think it is.Let's see side by side comparo pics of the interiors and then let's judge.

"louiswei","August 2006"," Side by side pictures comparo won't do any good...First off let me say that I totally agree with you 100% on every car in this segment are loaded with plastic. However, 2 very important factors determined if the interior feels ""plastic-ish"" or not:1. Percentage of hard-plastic used.2. Quality of the plastic used.If the interior used too much hard-plastic, it might looks good but once you touched it, it'll feel cheap. Same thing goes to lower-grade quality plastic. The Caddy probably didn't use more plastic than Audi but it definitely used more hard-plastic and the quality are lower grade. "
"jordanrobinson","August 2006"," Getting back to the topic I thought I was posting in, what do you guys consider Entry-Level? And what qualifies as performance? For instance would a Ford Fusion (V6) be considered performance? Granted it doesn't have a manual available, but the 6-speed Auto does a decent job. The 4-cyl has the manual but even being a good size 4 it doesn't offset the weight well enough. So I guess my questions are (being new to the forums and this discussion) is there some kind fo standard that has to be met to be considered entry-level and ""performance"" sedan? (Other then the obvious.) Some people would argue that a 4-door Civic can perform. But I would disagree. A lot. Thanks!  "
"pat","August 2006"," It's not just ""entry-level"" and ""performance"", but also ""luxury"". Neither the Fusion nor the Civic fit in that last category.

"jordanrobinson","August 2006"," Thanks Pat!! Since we're on the topic and it seems to fit better here, have any of you driven a new Lincoln Zephyr? Before I'm kicked out of the thread hear me out (and this is not a product advertisement, my dealership only does Ford/Mercury, no Lincoln.. yet..) Anyway, I recently drove a Zephyr after being told it was a lot like a Fusion. They were very wrong. Not only is the V-6 tuned to be MUCH beefier, but the suspension is very different and the amenities make much more of a luxury vehicle. (I checked the first post and I believe all the requirements for the thread are here!) Now, I realize compared to a lot of what you folks are referring to (BMW, Audi, etc) the Zephyr is underrated and outclassed to some extent. But it also stickers for right around $30k with a lot of style and luxury options such as leather, 3 stage heated and cooled seats, etc. It certainly impressed me more then the CTS I drove. Any opinions/experiences? "
"louiswei","August 2006"," IMO, I think Zephyr barely fits the entry-level luxury category but definitely not the ""performance"" and that's from a so-called poseur like me (because I drive an automatic). Many hardcored enthusiasts in this board will tell you that in order to be a ""real"" performance sedan one needs to:1. Have a manual tranny2. Be a RWD or AWDUnfortunately Zephyr has neither of those.Also, as many cars under this segment are pushing 300+ HP, Zephyr with 221 HP is definitely underpowered.

People care more about the gas prices than they used to and a lot do not want/need the fastest engine in these cars. BMW/Lexus has an option to get the style, luxury, etc and the higher gas mileage. Infiniti does not. I eliminated the old G35 on that basis and chose between the Lexus IS 250 and BMW 325. BMW dealership did not have a car equiped as I wanted and Lexus did and gave me a good deal. I wanted atleast 30mpg on the hwy since I drive a lot.Infinit will do well, but the lack of engine options will hamper it after the newness is over. "
"blueguydotcom","September 2006"," In the realm of engines that get 20-30 or 24-32, I'd expect to compare the low ends the same way.07 G35 - (15k miles /19 mpg) x 3.30 = 260506 IS250 - (15 k miles / 24 mpg) X 3.30 = 206206 330i - (15 k miles / 20 mpg) X 3.30 = 2475So yeah the IS250 gets great gas mileage but it's a really lousy car, imho. It's easily worth $400-600 to me per year to not drive an IS250. "
"jzalkin","September 2006"," I did not say that you cared about the difference, but many people do. The difference in real world driving will most often be bigger. I would expect a real world mpg difference of 6-7mpg. Since Lexus sells more IS250s than 350s (Audi sells more 2.0t vs 6cyl, etc) it leads me to the conclusion that most people do not care about overall speed. PS - How is the IS a ""really lousy car""? Speed on par with the smaller engines of other brands Audi, MB, BMW, etc. You may not like the car, but calling it lousy looses you credibility. I chose the Lexus over the BMW, but I can see how people like the BMW. There is really no lousy car in this segment; just choices with different attributes.

"jzalkin","September 2006"," Final reply on this topic:I understand it is an opinion (every post is), but I find it funny that so many pro BMW people can not acknowledge the benefits of the alternatives. I am not going to argue about the speed, but since most of these models are sold with the smaller engine, the masses have said that speed is not the major buying decision (my A4 had 187hp and weighed almost 4,000 pounds). BTW - I love how BMW fans use a marketing slogan to talk about cars. The Ultimate Driving Machine is an advertising slogan and not a true assessment of a car. Anyway - the BMW is a good car. The Lexus is a good car. The Infiniti will be a good car. All have their strengths and weaknesses. It depends on the individual buyer to determine which appeals to them. To dismiss the Lexus in the marketplace is just plain naive.If sales remain solid and they add the IS500, coupe, and convertible then the IS will have enough models to compete with the whole line of BMW. BMW will remain the sales leader, but with every generation Lexus, Infiniti (and Acura) are making better alternatives. "

"jrock65","September 2006"," ""Power is far more than ample both on the road and on the racetrack, where the G35 Sport felt more at home than did either the 330i or the IS provided for comparison. One clear advantage for the G35 over the BMW or the Lexus was found in Lime Rock&#146;s first turn, a long sweeper called Big Bend. Where the Lexus felt soft and floppy, like a bigger luxury sedan, and the BMW declined to take a set and instead leaned over, released, and leaned again, the G35 buckled down and hustled through, assisted on exit by the Sport model&#146;s standard viscous limited-slip differential.Track-day drivers take note: Another on-track advantage was on the backside, No Name Straight, where both the German and Japanese competition found their six-speed automatics shifting up just when you didn&#146;t want that, mere feet before the liftoff point. The Infiniti&#146;s five-speed automatic may just have better gearing for the course, but its manual mode allows the driver to hold a gear right up to the rev limiter, not trying to out-think the driver.This is appreciated, too, on the open road.

These cars are sports sedans, not race-cars, and not even stock Corvettes or Porsches.And it is not just the exotics that are going to automatics. I haven't seen it mentioned that the Mitsubishi Evolution X is going to be offered with a manual. And that will be THE best performance car next year, for under $40K. "
"blueguydotcom","September 2006"," I would not under any circumstances call a Ferrari F1 tranny or an Audi DSG a straight automatic. They have clutches, so they are in fact automated manuals. torque converters = automatics, like the garbage on the 3, IS350 and G35.That's why I excepted the DSG, SMGs, etc. Heck, the DSG is a flat out hoot to play with in a car. "
"kernick","September 2006"," Well my definition of a manual is a transmission with a clutch-pedal. Anything else regardless of whether it has a clutch a rubber-belt (CVT), DSG, a torque converter or whatever is an automatic. They are just different variations of automatic operation. IMO, an automatic transmission is one that you don't have to intervene with, unless you want to. In general: If a person can do anything better than a machine, it is simply a matter of time until that machine is evolved (designed) to be better. A person may enjoy shifting a manual and controlling the car in general, but more and more functions of a car can be better handled by the machine.On the cars being discussed here, I think either transmission is acceptable. I wouldn't worry about 0.2 sec difference or whatever in ""optimum launch"" acceleration, when this class of vehicle is not optimized for speed anyway. The cars being discussed here are too big, too heavy, and too small of displacement (at least without forced induction) to really quibble about their performance.I'd take the '07 G35X as the pick of the class for having adequate power combined with all-weather AWD, at a decent price. "
"kdshapiro","September 2006"," BG - I agree with you. A torque converter = automatic no matter how you slice it. While an automatic is not your cup of tea, the 4.9 0 to 60 that C&D got with the 335i, combined with probably above average gas mileage, makes the auto 335i a compelling package you have to admit. "
"blueguydotcom","September 2006"," Yeah compelling. But a DSG type tranny would make it far more enticing than a sloppy steptronic tranny.I think I'm done with large entry-lux cars.

"robertr","September 2006"," Agree with your definition of what an automatic is. I dislike automatics (=anything without a clutch) for a number of reasons. One in particular is I like to control how and when my car shifts. I hate it when you want to accelerate suddenly with an automatic - you floor the gas - then there is a delay - then it downshifts with a big jerk - then it finally goes with more power than you want but too late when you could have finessed it with an anticipatory double-clutched smooth downshift to the proper gear with smooth throttle application in a manual. A skillfully driven stick is still much smoother and more controlled than an automatic in all driving conditions despite automatics having gotten much better in recent years. The 2007 G35 automatic rev-matching feature on downshifts is the latest interesting improvement - I wonder if it will eliminate the jerk on the downshift that I experience everytime I get a loaner when my car is in for service. Nevertheless it will be a long long time before I want to give up the fun and satisfaction of driving a true manual. "

If an automaker wants my business, then they have to offer a manual, and NOT just to their lower-level cars.

"kernick","September 2006"," My point about these cars being discussed was that it was in this class of vehicles it is not that relevant to worry about the performance. These cars are too big, too heavy, and too small of displacement to ever really be near the tops in any performance categories. Whether a car can accelerate to 60mph in 5.5 or 5.8 or 6.0 sec really is not a significant difference. Or whether under optimal conditions you can get 5.5 sec with the manual, while you can get 5.8 sec. consistently with the auto. The same with many of the other performance categories of these cars. They are slight differences.To some it up in a few words I'd say if you want a performance car you shouldn't be buying any of these vehicles. These are ""sporty"" vehicles.The reason I pick the G35X is because I think AWD is a significant performance advantage for many in many types of weather. And I know BMW has AWD but I believe they will be significantly more $, and are down in power to the Infiniti. But neither is a Vette, Shelby-car, SRT-car, or Elise.

There were an abundance of Autos and a few SMGs.One final comment - one positive thing for automatics is that if you are the driver of a group of friends, an auto might be better in that if you are too tired to drive, a friend can drive your car back, while the same may not be the case of a manual.

Rear space was more than I had expected. The interior's fit and finish quality seemed superior to the sedan. Everything about this car seemed superior to the sedan, especially the styling.

"texasmerq","September 2006"," The Lancer Evo uses a very large turbo and to get the impressive acceleration numbers you have to keep the revs pretty high (3K-5K.) It is a very fun car to drive, especially on back roads with no traffic or police. That said in real world day to day for the average driver the 335i is probably faster as the torque comes in very early (1400-1800 RPM) and stays around past the normal shifting range in day to day driving (5K RPM.)I drove the 335i coupe this weekend but they only had automatics. They did shift extremely smoothly and quickly though. It was much better than I expected out of an automatic. I do prefer the rear view of the coupe, but I think I will wait on the 335i sedan personally because I prefer the overall styling of it more. To reiterate the steering did feel tighter which isn't necessarily a bad thing.I emailed an associate of mine who works for BMW in Germany and she said 335i sedans should become availible stateside beginning in Otober and should be saturated in most markets by late November. It has been availible there since mid-June I believe. If your dealer said it wasn't coming then they obviously just wanted to move units on the lot.

Regarding power v. displacement. While it's true that the EVO has a 2.0l and the WRX STi has a 2.5l engine they use much larger turbos and a higher boost as well. That's why there is more perceivable turbo lag in those applications. That's not to say they are bad but the 335i engine still feels like it's naturally aspirated for all intents and purposes.

I've been there a few times where the police stop traffic and only left AWD/4X4's go thru. The roads and my driveway are frequently a glacier for a few months. There is a reason that Subaru is the ""state-car"" around here.As far as RWD and performance go with winter, I hardly ever see any sort of RWD performance car on the roads. I have a Firebird that if I want to drive in the winter would go from 245-tires down to 215's for snows. Seeing that I've had to drive thru snow deep enough to bog down a Subaru.In a perfect road, sunny world RWD would be great. In this world I'll take all the traction and power I can get. Give me 8-powered wheels and 1,500hp, thank you! I want to travel in all weather and as much terrain as possible in my car. The Cayenne Turbo might be the right approach for me.BTW - 1) if the BMW turbo is closer to 330hp that is somewhat respectable. I was only going by their listed specs. and thought that was a little low relative to what has been done before. 2) Lambo and Audi seem to have some fine-AWD performance cars, in addition to what others have mentioned.

Still and all, my winter tire shod 530i happily plowed through an easy 8"" of snow, right up our street and up our driveway with nary a wheel slip. That having been said, several of our neighbors across the street have driveways that exceed 30% and there is simply no way the 5er would climb those driveways, winter tires or not. At one of our monthly poker parties last winter I barely made it up on foot, and, ummmm, a few single malts later going down was even more fun. :blush: Even though I've never managed to get any of our 2WD cars up any of those driveways when slippery, I don't feel too bad as all of the residents of those houses park their AWD Volvos, Audis and 4WD Dodge Rams and Jeeps on the street when the snow flies. Why? Well, a Jeep driver made it half way up one of the driveways last winter, lost traction and then had to get towed out of the front yard of the house across the street.

Considering all things being equal, the BMW get the nod (as it should due to it's longevity of being good. That is why the when it tied the Lexus, the BMW got top honors. The same just happened with the new G35. It is funny how the car magazines you point out as giving the BMW a runaway victory keeps saying it is a tie and is is only broken by the smallest margins. I would not be shocked if the new G35 wins the next round as it beat the older 3 series in C&D. My point is that all three excel and a buyer must determine whaat fits them best. The BMW for you, the Lexus for me. The difference is that I just don't have to convince myself that there is only one great option.PS - I think some posters need to get perspective. One can appreciate all 3 cars. There are things that I like in my friend's new 5 series that I wish Lexus had emulated and there are things he liked better in my Lexus and wished he had.

That Lexus has a good engine and decent dynamics and great reliability is a positive draw to many. "
"habitat1","September 2006"," ""Like Lexus cares how the press feels since the car sells like hot cakes!""Define ""hot cakes"".I see about 20 3-series cars on the road for every previous IS300.The new IS350 has been clearly marketed at the ""enthusiast"", but fails to include a manual transmission option. The fact that less than 50% of 3-series are sold with manuals should not be misconstrued to suggest offering a manual isn't important. A reputation of a car within the sporting, enthusiast demographic has a halo effect on all sales. And with Lexus decision to promote a slushbox only transmission choice, they will never get serious enthusiasts talking positively about the IS. When Lexus took on Mercedes in the luxury segment, they did a good job. Their approach in the sport sedan segment, with the IS and GS, leaves a lot to be desired, IMO. And it's not just the manual transmission, although that's an obvious omission. Drive a 5 series back to back with a GS and if you can't tell a big difference in driving dynamics, you need your butt-meter recalibrated. Or you need to buy a Lexus, because broken butt-meters are exactly what they appear to be aiming at. "
"louiswei","September 2006"," The bottom line is: Lexus is not out there to satisfy the so-called enthusiast. They are simply out there selling cars no matter how you going to spin it. The sales number for the IS is around 5000-6000 units per month and compare to 3er's 10K+ I think so far the IS is doing a pretty good job sales-wise. The Rome is not built in one day, so does not the 3er nor the IS. It took BMW many decades to establish the 3er as the benchmark and it's likely that it'll take some time for others to knock it off (if they ever will).One thing that frustrated me the most is that many Lexus owners can understand why others went for the 3er (pure driving dynamics) and why we went for the IS (balance between luxurious and performance). However, on the other end, the so-call pure enthusiasts (you know whom I am talking about) can never acknowledge that the IS is a capable competitor in this segment. I am going to say this one last time: driving dynamics may be the ultimate factor for you but that may not be the one for many other people, you know? Lighten up, look outside your own box then maybe you'll have a better perspective.Y'all have a good day  "
"kdshapiro","September 2006"," ""can never acknowledge that the IS is a capable competitor in this segment""That is certainly one opinion of a very broad topic, and I disagree with the conclusion. BMW continues to win accolades for it's driving dynamics, but each car in this segment has it's contribution and attributes that make it desirable.In fact, I can't even remember anyone saying there is no compeition and *BMW is the one* and there is no other vehicle in this segment.I'm surprised you didn't notice some of the most ""enthusiastic"" people in this forum, were always hoping the other manufacturers somehow *got it right* for a price much less than a BMW.

"jzalkin","September 2006"," Lexus has stated the goal of the new IS is being exceeded so I would call it a success. How many version of the 3 series is there (Sedans, M, coupe, convertible). The IS has only one version (Sedan). It is selling 5k-6k a month - not bad for one variation. Lexus has even learned to stagger versions to keep interest up. How many BMW (current or potential) owners will visit Lexus when the IS500 comes? Would it be better for some if it had a manual for the 350 - yes. Electronics can be turned off now - so it is a non issue. Would the BMW be better without I-drive and enhanced interior design. What about better reliability - sure.Here is a question - how many BMW 3 series did they sell in its 2nd generation in the US? Not sure of answer myself, but it is amazing what Lexus (and Infiniti) is achieving in a short time frame. Here is a statement I think holds true. The Lexus satisfies luxury owners and is also bringing in enthusiasts as well. Considering Gen 1 was not a sales success - there are a lack of repeat buyers. Most are from other car makers (like Audi for me). Imagine what will happen in Gen 3. Considering it came down to the BMW & Lexus for me, I would say both have good products and that Lexus achieved its goal. I have never owned a Lexus (Audi, Ford Cobra, 300ZX, RX-7) and Lexus struck the right balance of Luxury, Driving Fun, and Overall Ownership Experience with the IS. PS - Go read Club Lexus if you don't believe that enthusiasts are also buying it. "
"habitat1","September 2006"," I have no doubt that the vast majority of IS owners are enthusiastic about their car. As they should be.But it appears to me that Lexus, with the IS and GS, directed a lot of their marketing towards the ""driving"" enthusiast. They even advertised the new GS with a new ""6-speed transmission"" (no reference to automatic) and showed a glimpse of somebody appearing to shift gears in BMW style winding Bavarian road commercial. Stupid me stopped by a dealership between meetings and learned that it was nothing more than a slushbox with a manual shift capability. I still drove it. Dissapointing is an understatement. I have absolutely no problem giving Lexus credit where it is due. The make a superbly crafted automobile, with great reliability. Mercedes got a swift kick in the [non-permissible content removed] and we have all benefited by the increased competition. To that, I say ""thanks Lexus"", and I mean it.Where I part company with some Lexus enthusiasts, is my belief the IS and GS could be significantly better at delivering on their marketing theme of going after the driving enthusiast. Like Honda did with the $32k S2000 that gave the $60k Porsche Boxster S a run for their money. It seems that some would like to forgive Lexus their sporting deficiencies and substitute techno-goodies and interior design for driving dynamics in the comparison with the 3-series. Look, I understand trade offs. I bought a TL 6-speed because of the balance of attributes - at a great price. But you won't find me touting that it's comparable to the 3-series in driving dynamics. And, the TL comes with a 6-speed, Brembo brakes, and a sport suspension that, in spite of FWD, apparantly beats the IS350 in a the slalom.So I'm not here to bash the IS350 for what it is. But I will continue to call a spade a spade about what it isn't. And I hope Lexus doesn't try to use a 1,000 watt 32 speaker Mark Levinson stereo to bribe more driving enthusiast's into succumbing to luxury as a substitue for what a serious sports sedan should be.

An IS350 with sport package and xenons is in the mid 39k range. The same 330i, sp, leather, xenons was 40k range. But the BMW provides you with 4 years of free service - at least a $500 savings. I'd say that'd make it a wash. Except you can't really order an IS350: rather you wait months to see if Lexus will build your car. You can customer order a BMW, not so a Lexus. A BMW CCA rebate - available to any member of BMWCCA - nets you $500 too. Where's the savings of the IS350?My 330i was 35.7k through European Delivery (msrp of 41k+). Hmm, that's a good 3k+ below the cost of the Lexus. Not including free maintenance.Yeah the 335i is 1800 more expensive, so now you have a legit case for saying the 335 is more expensive than the IS350. But then again, considering the IS350 is outperformed in everything but straightline by the 06 330i, it seems to reason for better driving in all circumstances - acceleration, handling, roadfeel, slalom, etc, the 335i is worth it to someone who cares about performance. Of course, ED on a 335i with my options will only be 37-38k. That's still cheaper than an IS350. As of now, BMW already obliterates the IS350 in the form of M3, why wait for the 335?It's an ugly coupe. It's overpriced. Lemme see, e46 body/ chassis. ugly/worthless 2 door coupe and 3.2 liter gas guzzler for 50k or get an 07 335i sedan for 38k ED and 20/28 mpg? That's a real easy call.

Furthermore chippers have already found the engine can be modded quite easily. So again, unlike the M3, there's engine tuning that can drastically increase the performance. What about warranties? well, dinan always warranties bimmers with their chips. My guess, by 2008 we'll see a Dinan chip that will give the 3.0TT over 400 hp (it's already got over 330 hp/330 tq - it's underrated) and 400 ft-lbs torque.

"louiswei","September 2006"," us non-enthusiasts (or so-call poseurs) will just have to agree to disagree.However, I have pointed this out before and I'll do it again: It's rather interesting to me that the so-call enthusiasts are so focused on the driving dynamics factor which they have completely ignored (or chosen to) other important criteria like driving comfort, gadgets, interior quality, etc... I understand that we are talking about performance sedans here but at the same time these are designed to be everyday drivers. Majority of the buyers choose them because they are fun to drive and practical enough to use to commute everyday to work or to school. As a daily driver (or a commuter) shouldn't we at least take some other factors into consideration besides handling? On the other hand, I'll totally agree with the so-call enthusiasts if we are talking about the performance sports cars like habitat1's 911S. For the cars at that level, people rarely use them as daily drivers (although some do). They are more like a weekend fun car so people can take it out for a spin or take it to the track. It'll be totally ridiculous if we are taking the ventilated seats and cup-holders into the consideration if we are talking about the 911 here. As matter of fact I think people whom buy an automatic 911 (or even Boxster and Cayman) are nuts. However, the last time I checked, we are talking about the ""entry-level Luxury Performance Sedans"" here instead of ""Very expensive ultra sports cars"".I know this post is not going to change anybody's opinion (and yes, everyone's entitled to have their own) especially the hard-core enthusiasts like Blueguydotcom. However, I hope people can understand through this post that handling and driving dynamics is not the only factor to many buyers (to some of you maybe, but you are definitely not the majority) and to many others, maybe the ventilated seats are equally as important as BMW's awesome handling.

"habitat1","September 2006"," ""Nice move: take my statement completely out of the context in which it was written. There's nothing like setting up a fake argument and then batting it down. Good job."" I re-read your orignianl post and probably did take your statement out of context - sorry. But I stand by the point that I may have not appropriately communicated:It is a subjective decision for everyone here to chose the car that is right for them. And the Lexus IS350, G35, 335i, TL, and others are all legitimate choices, each with their own attributes. That's not in dispute as far as I'm concerned.But, IMO, the attributes that make up what I would refer to as overall driving dynamics and performance have at least some significant element of objectiveness. That fact that you would chose an IS with an automatic or I would chose a FWD TL 6-speed, or someone else would switch from a BMW to a Lexus means that we have made our own subjective choice on the attributes that are important to each of us. It does not mean that the BMW is still not, based upon my test drives, the heads and shoulders leader in driving dynamics. So, with all due respect to those who may forego rowing your own gears or, as I did, want a little more of a family sized sedan than the 3 series offered in 2004, that's our collective perogative. But as far as driving dynamics goes, I for one am not so insecure as to give full credit to the BMW 335i where is is due. And if Lexus (or Acura) really wants to compete with BMW in that arena, it isn't going to be with a slushbox only transmission choice and numb steering (Lexus) or a FWD platform (Acura), or an overweight AWD platform (Audi) or cupholders or ventilated seats or...

It'll be a harder decision for me if I choose to buy now instead of 6 months ago. However, I think I might come to the same decision ultimately because of 335i's hefty price and its still-ugly interior (IMO of course).However, let me raise this one issue...Since the 3er is the benchmark in this segment do everyone else (that's Lexus, Infiniti, Audi, MB and Acura) need to play BMW's game (driving dynamics)? What if one day say the IS or G or even TL surpass 3er's overall sales number does it still make the 3er the benchmark of the segment? I am not going to say that it's going to happen but what if it does? I really don't think it's necessary for the competitors to become BMW-copycats in order to beat BMW. I'll actually give them more respect if they can beat BMW while keep their own identity. "

While I don't have time to look it up right now, if you look over in the IS discussion here at Edmunds, you'll find a post that includes a quote from a Lexus executive from maybe thirteen or fourteen months back that says something like, ""The new IS will outperform the 3-Series in every category.""A number of folks who've spent lots of time in the seat of a BMW saw that quote as extremely promising, me included. At the time I reasoned that even if I didn't end up with a new IS, some good competition certainly wasn't going to be a bad thing. As more details on the new car worked their way into the public domain it became more and more apparent that the Gen2 IS wasn't going to be able to fulfill its promise. Once the car was released it proved to be a cruel joke for those of us who would love to at least have a true alternative to the venerable 3-Series.Is the IS a bad car? No. That having been said, given its relatively mushy handling, slushy transmission, unavailability of a true manual for the IS350, vague steering and cramped rear quarters, I found myself walking away wondering how the aforementioned executive could even remotely believe the IS was superior to the 3-Series in all areas.Best Regards,Shipo "

Just to make the record straight, here's what EXACTLY what the Lexus GM Bob Carter said in Edmunds live chat back in September 29, 2005:msm_IS asks: Do you think you will beat BMW's sales of the 3-series?Bob Carter: It's not our goal to compare ourselves with any other manufacturer. I am confident that we have a fantastic vehicle coming to market. Most luxury manufacturers address this segment through vehicles that offer a compromise on either performance or luxury. Lexus has taken a different approach. We are addressing this segment by offering two completely different models. The IS models offer incredible performance with all the luxury you would expect in a Lexus. Our ES 330 emphasizes the comfort and refined feel which Lexus is known for, and comes in a sophisticated and stylish exterior.coopnet asks: How does Lexus feel the IS250/IS350 compares to the 325i/330i?Bob Carter: The IS is a much better car!!He said the IS is a much better car. He did NOT said, and I quote from ship: ""The new IS will outperform the 3-Series in every category"".Here's the link: Bob Carter Live Chat "

"habitat1","September 2006"," ""Since the 3er is the benchmark in this segment do everyone else (that's Lexus, Infiniti, Audi, MB and Acura) need to play BMW's game (driving dynamics)?"" No, they don't need to play BMW's game, but then they might want to tone down the ""sports"" sedan marketing theme as though they are going after the serious driving enthusiast.FWIW, I am similarly critical of Acura with the RL. All this ""super-handling"" and ""300 horsepower"" advertising showing the car winding through the Bavarian Alps. Well, it's NOT super handling compared to the 5-series and, as it turns out, it didn't even have 300 hp and felt downright sluggish compared to my TL 6-speed. Not to mention no manual transmission option. It seems like Acura's marketing folks wanted to have us believe the RL was a driving enthusiast's competitor to the 550i, but they forgot to tell their engineering department to deliver on the goods.Let me give you a positive example of a car that DID deliver on the goods - the $33,000 Honda S2000. They, with limited self promoting fanfare, took on the best from BMW ($40k Z3), Mercedes ($45k SLK) and Porsche ($50k Boxster) and, IMO, beat them. As a result, they didn't have to sing their own praises, every major car magazine and hordes of serious driving enthusiasts did it for them.________________________________""What if one day say the IS or G or even TL surpass 3er's overall sales number does it still make the 3er the benchmark of the segment? I am not going to say that it's going to happen but what if it does? I really don't think it's necessary for the competitors to become BMW-copycats in order to beat BMW. I'll actually give them more respect if they can beat BMW while keep their own identity."" Sorry, but I think we have a serious disagreement on the definition of ""beat"". A Honda Accord selling 400,000 cars a year doesn't mean it ""beats"" the 335i. And the limited production Honda S2000, selling only 5,000 units a year didn't ""lose"" to the Z3 or Boxster. Toll Brothers sells 10,000 luxury homes a year, but they don't ""beat"" Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater or Robie House in terms of architectural character.There is no doubt that there are a lot more ""semi"", ""non"" and ""sort of"" enthusiasts buying so-called sports sedans than there are serious driving enthusiasts. And there are even more ""get me from A to B"" drivers perfectly happy with a Camry, Accord or, e-gads, a GM. But, IMO, if Lexus, Acura, Audi or Infiniti insist on calling their vehicles ""sports sedans"", they cannot claim any victory until over BMW until serious driving enthusiasts can drive one in a sports sedan-ish sort of way and get out thinking that it performs better. If they want to call them ""entry level luxury sedans"", then perhaps they have changed the metric in their favor. For me, it's as simple as that. P.S. And just to clarify, my definition of performance is not one dimensional like 0-60 times. It is the entire ""sporting"" driving experience. Which for a semi-enthusiast, might allow for a paddle shifting slushbox. Not for me (and I accept I am flirting with subjectivity, now). "
"louiswei","September 2006"," A Honda Accord selling 400,000 cars a year doesn't mean it ""beats"" the 335i.Horrible example, you can't compare the Accord to 335i since they are in different class. Also, is S2000 the segment leader in general consensus? I don't think so, it's just a really good cheaper alternative to the Boxster and Z4 just like the G35 is to the 3er.I have no objection at all to crown the 3-series the performance leader in the class even if one day it does lose the sales crown. However, in this segment it's not all about performance (to the auto mags maybe). To me the reason I spend ~35K to get a sedan in this segment is because I want a car that's well-balanced between luxury and performance as well as being somewhat practical as an everyday driver and cars in this class deliver that. Some are more on performance (G and 3er) and some are more on luxury (C-class). FOR ME I think the IS strikes the perfect balance of the 2 and that's why now it's my daily driver. Otherwise, like you said if performance and fun to drive is all I want I will be probably better off to get a S2000 instead.Habitat1, you are a very lucky man to have a 911S as your fun car but some of us (actually many of us) don't have that luxury. So for me I need a car that can give me a little giddy up when needed but at the same time offers me comfort during my daily commute. I think by now everybody knows that I am by no means an enthusiast (probably not even a semi) so sports sedan to me means RWD and better handling than a midsize sedan. I can understand that the IS did not live up to many enthusiasts' expectation but it is no way a FAILURE or CRAP like some here have stated. "

That's the exact quote according to shipo anyway but so far I still can't find the source of that.I am not going to get into another discussion of what's performance. For me performance is the combination of handling, road-feel, smooth tranny, acceleration and many others. One thing for sure is the IS did deliver on the acceleration part but maybe not so much of the other area. However on the other hand the 3er at that time was seriously behind the acceleration game but leading on the other area. Maybe the 330i has a better overall package on performance (which I think it does) but it's still fairly subjective.By the way, the IS has definitely delivered on the luxury part though. "

"habitat1","September 2006"," I fully agree with you that a serious sports sedan - focused primarily upon driving performance - is not what everyone wants or needs in their daily driver. (As evidence, you got an IS and I got a TL). I'm not trying to talk you out of being happy with your car, just as I wouldn't want to defend my decision to get a TL. But it initially appeared to me - and apparantly others - that Lexus marketed the IS350 as a serious sports sedan. To that extent it falls short of the 335i. False expectations were created. That does not detract from its luxury attributes and the fact that for some it represents a better personal choice. And, on that note, I'm going to conclude my rambling with a ""so what"" back to myself. We are all, I assume, reasonably intelligent people who can set marketing pitches aside and make purchase decisions for ourselves. The fact that Lexus might have been a bit ambitious in marketing the ""sport"" orientation of the IS is not the end of the world. Nor is Acura's coining the term ""super handling"" for something that isn't. Hell, when I bought my 2002 Honda S2000, it WAS a ""substitute"" for the ""there is no substitute"" Porsche Boxster. And a pretty damn good one at that. So take my comments with the assurance that I respect your decision to get a very nice car that has the balance of attributes that work for you. If we all agreed on everything, this would be a boring world. Although I wouldn't mind seeing a few more Robie Houses and a few less Toll Brothers houses in the future.  "

Don't play his game I do NOT think BMW is somehow invicible at ""their game"". I'll argue vehemently that the S2000 was heads and shoulders a better roadster from a driving dynamics standpoint than the Z3/Z4 ever was/is. Granted, the three series has been their strong suit. But even the 5 series evolution, to a bigger, bulkier, heavier car, with a less driver oriented cockpit and stupid i-drive opened the door for competition. I had hoped Acura would make a RWD V-8 RL with some of the same engineering creativity that went into the S2000 and give BMW a run for their money. Wishful thinking. But I hope that other manufacturers don't run for the hills rather than challenge BMW as the king of the sports sedans.

I can't find such a thing, so I'm stuck leasing BMWs. The Lexus brand, like the Caddy one, appeals to a certain group. A group that places luxury above performance. i'm not in that group. It'd make life a lot easier if I could put up with a dowdy, bland car like a used Lexus LS430. I could buy one now and just drive it for 6-7 years like a friend of mine.

(Apologies to any S-type lovers out there, but that's just my personal opinion.. I don't see the point in getting the S-type with the X-type available.. from my perspective, either fork out for the XJ, or keep your pennies with the X-type).I'll eat my words for one exception to the S-type family - the S-Type R. It's a monster. 400 HP, and smooth as silk. I had the pleasure of getting to take a test drive in one of these... pretty much no words to describe how much I love driving this car.

I see BMW's everywhere (I live in the same town as BMW's Canadian headquarters) and nobody looks twice because they are so common now. IMHO, all their cars look alike (the 3, 5 and to some degree, 7 all look like slightly longer, or shorter versions of the same car) and I'm getting really sick on them... but a Jaguar turns heads everywhere it goes - resale value notwithstanding./DA "
"kdshapiro","October 2006"," In my book, BMWs are headturners. Jaguar with the exception of the Jaguars of the bygone era are nothing special to look at. Nobody around here even gives them a second look. I used to live in a town where people yawned when they saw Ferraris on the street. So I guess it all depends on what you are used to seeing. "

Is that really a fair comparo ?Like merc1 said, Lexus has only 3 truck models - GX, LX and RX. The hybrid is only a variant with different engine of the RX lineup so it's not a separate model by itself (example: 335i/328i, IS350/250 and your beloved CTS 2.8L/3.6L). Also, and yes the Land Cruiser has always come with Toyota badge and still is.They also don't make a large SUV either.

And I suspect your previous 10 were in the previous hour. Unfortunately, the majority of these posts seem to be cluttered with misinformation. Very cluttered.My nephew is picking up a 335i coupe fully loaded with premium package (leather included), sport package, cold weather package and navigation at the factory (European Delievery Program) for $43,500 in December. For that price, they are throwing in a free session at BMW's performance driving school when he has time to go in the spring. By all measures of true quality and engineering, that is a very good deal.But I guess if you are inclined to buy GM junk for $20,000 to $30,000 that depreciates to about half that value in the first 18 months, $43,500 might seem like a lot of money. Or if you are inclined to have a non-challenging day job that allows you to spend hours posting 20-30 times a day on Edmunds, $43,500 might seem unachievable. I suspect you would be right on that count. The world is full of underachievers. BMW doesn't need to sell to them to be successful and personally, I hope they never lower themselves to doing that. Leather seating surfaces do not represent what makes BMW a superiorly engineered car, in case you've never driven one. You can put all the leather lipstick in the world on the GM pig and guess what you still have??? :confuse:If, in fact, $43,500 (or less, without the extra options) is too much for you to stomach, then make your choices accordingly. But don't chastise those who can afford a 335i as buying a car that is overpriced. Or suggest that a G6 with Lay-Z-Boy leather and Lay-Z-Boy handling can even be compared to a Honda Accord in quality, let alone a 335i. Or as an alternative, you might consider posting less and working harder so that eventually that $43,500 isn't so far out of reach. My company attorney (that I pay), makes enough in 1 hour a day to buy a new Ferrari 430 every year. Think about that when you are on your 20th post tomorrow. "

"habitat1","October 2006"," Rocky,I'm not going to give you a lesson on economics and try to convince you to buy a BMW. I'm not on BMW's marketing payroll and I don't care what you drive. Vice-versa I'm sure. But I will share my personal experience and why I don't ever see financially sophisticated buyers flocking from BMW (or Lexus, or Acura or..) to Cadillac. From 1987 to 1995 I owned a Acura Integra. Initial cost $12,600. Retired to Salvation Army in 1995 w/ 127k miles. From 1995 to present I own a Nissan Maxima. Initial cost $20,500. Retired from primary duty in 2004, but still alive and kicking at 155k miles.Perhaps there is a GM/Cadillac model that you would find attractive to own for the next 10 years. I have a seriously dificult time renting a GM for 10 days on business. For me, the value of a 335i, or any number of other really well built and well engineered cars, is that they can last 10-15 years - and still be enjoyable to drive at the end of that time. If you buy high quality that lasts, at a fair price, you will almost always be ahead of buying low quality at a cheaper price. GM has a long history of producing vehicles that, after 5 years, hardly anyone WANTS to own. They might have the ability to last 150k miles, but if they weren't already killing you with squeeks and rattles when they were new, they certainly will by the 5 year mark. I seriously doubt even you would find a 5+ year ownership experience desireable. I'm sure GM would have something with another 100 lbs of torque to get your blood going. And you'd be stuck trying to find someone who finds a 4-5 year old Caddy an attractive car. They may be out there where you live, but they sure aren't in my neighborhood. So in summary, I don't fault you for liking GM. That's your perogative. And, I certainly don't fault you for thinking $40k is expensive. I made the same as you when I bought that Integra and thought, at the time, that a $20k Legend was too much. But I would respectfully suggest that true build quality and long term value are not things that should be dismissed in favor of leather and torque. And that's where IMO, BMW will continue to shine over GM.P.S. In 1988 I bought a fixer upper house in a good neighborhood that I stretched for. This month, I'll send in the final mortgage payment. It's current market value is about as much as our 911S ... plus a 911 Turbo, Cayenne Turbo, and Carerra GT combined. So don't feel too bad for those of us that put money into a house instead of a Caddy... or a BMW... or even an Acura Legend.  "
"rockylee","October 2006"," Rocky, I'm not going to give you a lesson on economics and try to convince you to buy a BMW.Thank-you. I guess habitat, I'm partial pal with GM, because most of my family has worked for them and Delphi.Dad, and a few remaining relatives took the early buy-out at the end of July after 27 yrs. I still have a few family members left on the GM and Delphi payroll. I'm not on BMW's marketing payroll and I don't care what you drive. Vice-versa I'm sure.That is correct again. I'm just glad you aren't interested in cars made with cheap labor by child slaves.

Cadillac has rebounded itself. I agree they need get that interior down to European levels to have a chance at regaining market-share.From 1987 to 1995 I owned a Acura Integra. Initial cost $12,600. Retired to Salvation Army in 1995 w/ 127k miles.  Those were fun to drive cars. Like a Go-Kart, my buddy had a GS-R coupe a mid 90's model  IFrom 1995 to present I own a Nissan Maxima. Initial cost $20,500. Retired from primary duty in 2004, but still alive and kicking at 155k miles.Maxima's are nice. They were a big player in the mid-90's. They have redone the interior very nicely, what last year ? Perhaps there is a GM/Cadillac model that you would find attractive to own for the next 10 years.I used to swap cars often, but now I like to hold on to them for at least 3 years. I'm going to buy at least my wifes grandma's 2000 Buick Century for $4K. She passed away a couple of months ago. It has like 70K on it. It will be my future work car. My grandmother has a 2002 Oldsmobile Aurora, with 43K and she is willing to sell it to me for $10K. I think I'm going to buy it also for the wife and kids. That's below trade in value. I'm going to pay cash for both. I have a seriously difficult time renting a GM for 10 days on business.Getting the low-end models must stink.For me, the value of a 335i, or any number of other really well built and well engineered cars, is that they can last 10-15 years - and still be enjoyable to drive at the end of that time.I completely understand. GM, in the past they built some very horrible cars. I know why you are so skeptical about the future. In my eyes I'm finally seeing action, instead of just promises from GM. I as you know post alot. I spend alot of time gathering the newest inside secrets I can, and like posting links on Edmunds. Especially when it has something to do with GM.If you buy high quality that lasts, at a fair price, you will almost always be ahead of buying low quality at a cheaper price. Agree GM has a long history of producing vehicles that, after 5 years, hardly anyone WANTS to own. They might have the ability to last 150k miles, but if they weren't already killing you with squeaks and rattles when they were new, they certainly will by the 5 year mark.Agree. However I'm beginning to see changes. The 2004' GTO was the beginning of change and signs of quality. It didn't sell well because of style. The Lucerne is another nice piece of quality. Now we have the new SUV's CUV's Trucks, and you gotta agree that was a huge quality jump from the previous generation. habitat, take a Saturn Aura sometime when you get a chance for a test drive. It's not like you are obligated to buy it. How bout those Kappa Twins ? I seriously doubt even you would find a 5+ year ownership experience desirable.Off the top of my head the Aurora's, 95-99 Riviera were both Rock Solid. My former 02' Cadillac Seville STS was rock solid also. But yeah, for the most part you are correct unfortunately.I'm sure GM would have something with another 100 lbs of torque to get your blood going. And you'd be stuck trying to find someone who finds a 4-5 year old Caddy an attractive car. They may be out there where you live, but they sure aren't in my neighborhood.Yes Cadillacs, are very popular around here. Lots of conservative people around here. They like domestics especially the Trucks and SUV's (Mainly GM) Michigan, OTOH the conservatives like Japananese, and domestics, kinda weird to me. :surprise:So in summary, I don't fault you for liking GM. That's your prerogative. And, I certainly don't fault you for thinking $40k is expensive. I made the same as you when I bought that Integra and thought, at the time, that a $20k Legend was too much.$40K I think is alot of money, no matter how much you make. If I was a millionaire it would still be a good chunk of change. I hope GM, can make a car that even somebody like you would like to own someday. But I would respectfully suggest that true build quality and long term value are not things that should be dismissed in favor of leather and torque. And that's where IMO, BMW will continue to shine over GM. They do shine, and have a huge fan base. People who can and can't afford but both desire them the same. I've always respected BMW's cars. It's not like they are POS's. They are true-blue German Engineered. Even I was close to pulling the trigger on a very low mileage 97' Black M3 sedan last year.  Got a Question, I sat in my buddy's 97' M3 sedan in the back seat. Is the 335i as roomy as it in the back seat ???? How much will the 400 hp M3 be ? Will the sedan be the same price as the coupe ???? (If you know by chance?)P.S. In 1988 I bought a fixer upper house in a good neighborhood that I stretched for. This month, I'll send in the final mortgage payment. It's current market value is about as much as our 911S ... plus a 911 Turbo, Cayenne Turbo, and Carrera GT combined. Hey rich guy, if you ever come to Texas, you need to look me up and give me a ride in your 911S :P Ne ways congrats on paying your home off. I bet that felt good.  Too bad my generation will never be able to get a ""affordable"" home. They are so out of line with prices. :mad: Dad, and grandpa told me it use to be that the rule of thumb was to not buy more house than 1-weeks net pay. Now they say 2 weeks and if your spouse has a job 3 weeks. :surprise: I know I'm much younger than you, but is my generation insane or what habitat ????So don't feel too bad for your friends that put money into a house instead of a Caddy... or a BMW... or even an Acura Legend. That is true, but some of them are buying the Cadillac of houses.... one's they really can't afford. I think if you looked around you'd agree. House + Car doesn't=Job :confuse:Rocky "

"rockylee","October 2006"," Got it. So what car in here appeals to you and why? You can have the Detroit torque, I'm way past that. I want a quality drive with the Detroit torque, unfortunately I can't afford a Bugatti.For 2007' I'd say the most appealing entry lux cars on the market are the G35, BMW 335i, Lexus IS 350, Acura TL Type-S, and yes a CTS, and thats about covers it, right ? Why do I like these cars ? Well they all have above average performance. Some offer a bit more ""gadgets"" while the others offer a bit more performance. If money was no option it would be a 335i since it's the newest player and has the best performance, while still offering enough gadgets. The TL Type-S, probably would be the most practical since it's a FWDer and can be driven year-around. The G35, is pretty darn nice also. The Lexus IS, has the most gadgets, but it's back seat is very tight. It's probably the best looking though. The Lexus IS, without the sport suspension package is roughly $44-45K Add the sport suspension it's about $47K, and finally it might be worth getting since VDIM is defeatable for 07'. I hope to see a head to head test of a 335i vs. 07 IS 350. Now that would be a great test.  In 2008' we will be able to throw Cadillac, into the mix without any regrets. RockyP.S.

"brightness04","October 2006","  I'm not boasting about it because it's never enough unless you are rich like brightness Nah, I made only $30k or so back when I was 24; that was probably below average income nation-wide, and certainly below average where I lived . . . thank goodness I made a little more earlier, so had a car fully paid for already so I had a car to drive around that year. It was tough to make a living on $30k in Boston, even without a car payment.Cars are about the worst place to park money, IMHO. It hardly matters which brand you buy, most of them cost about 50% purchase price in three years after factoring depreciation, interest payment, taxes and insurance. That's purchase price, not MSRP. Relatively high line cars may have higher residual as per centage of MSRP, they have higher base to begin with and have higher cost of money (ie. either the interest cost or the cost of your own money not earning interest). Take for example, even the 335i, three year residual is about 61%-65% (assuming real life resale is as high as ALG number, which is highly doubtful), cost of money at 5% works out to be 15% over three years. The 50% mark is reached even before typical 3-8% sales tax, 2-3% annual excise tax, $700-$2000 (2-5%) annual insurance etc . . . The only way to keep the per centage somewhat lower is waiting for the initial craze to pass, and shop for deep discounts and interest subsidies. That used to be GM's specialty, but nowadays BMW seems to have joined the club too. "

A person who can afford an M5 is not buying a CTS-V. People buy those cars for specific reasons, none of which Cadillac can offer. We will see within 2 years.

I think Cadillac is too little to late. People will have to choose between ""Life. Liberty. and the Pursuit"". or Ultimate Driving Machine The difference is big. The BMW, does have benchmark handling characteristics. The new CTS-V, will flat out blow the doors off of any BMW ever made in a straight-line.I think BMW, will keep its hardcore handling obsessed audience, but will still have slices of the pie taken away by Cadillac, and Acura's 09' TL. They will be new customers, and I think both car company's could hamper BMW, from new generations. Cadillac, and we know Acura will deliver the goods in Gadgetology, and both will be cheaper to own because of price, and reliability.In 2007' the decision won't be as hard as the future.

BMW has the ability to attract younger buyers with their entry level product (3er) and keep them as loyal customers while they move up the ladder to the 5, 6 and 7 series. So far I haven't seen the CTS to have the ability of doing the same for Caddy yet. Also, another problem for Caddy is that there is not a strong upper lineup. The STS is respectable but after compare it to 5er, E, M and GS then it becomes laughable. I am not even going to go to DTS since its definitely not up to par to compete with the other flagships. Based on the assessment I'll say that Caddy is having trouble to attract younger buyers and at the same time also having trouble to turn them into loyal customers. So even though you, Rocky, are very optimistic about Caddy's future; Me, however, is not so much.Infiniti is doing the same thing and doing it well with the G and the M seems to be a good candidate of a potential upgrade. The missing piece right now for Infiniti is that it doesn't have a respectable flagship yet (I am pretty sure they are working very hard to come up with the next Q). Once that piece is in place, Infiniti could become a potential force to be reckon with. If I am BMW, I'll be watching them very closely more than any other manufactures.Acura has a winner in TL but failed to provide a next one up in their lineup (I really don't see the RL as a serious competitor among the 5er, E, GS and M group with a V6). They also don't have a large luxury sedan to go head to head with other flagships.Last but not least Lexus was in the similar situation as Caddy with an older-age customer base. However, Lexus has a very strong upper lineup (way stronger than Caddy) with their GS and LS so all they have to do is to create a winner in the bottom then they should be fine. Seems to me that the new IS is doing its part to help out the age group imbalance situation and hopefully Lexus can learn from a few mistakes in the current IS (no stick, soft) and implementing into the next generation.

Those are the halo cars which function is to attract customers into the show room. Of course there are also many rich people out there are willing to spend big bucks on the halo cars but they are after all the minority. The success of BMW is built on their bread and butter - the 3-series. Without having a winner in the entry level market, BMW could be well in trouble regardless if they have a 1000 HP, 100 MPG M3 or M5. With that in mind, if Caddy cannot produce a winner in the mainstream market (entry-level) I seriously doubt that it'll be successful down the road. "

The CTS-V is faster than that? Even if it did have the horsepower you stated, trying to use that on the road, will cause the vehicle to wind up smashed in a concrete abutment.Come on, you need to get to the here and now.

Instead of producing cars that last, are attractive and people want to buy, they focus on the niche market place.I suggest you create a thread in the future vehicles section titled: ""CTS-V: Watch the other auto manufacturers declare bankruptcy"".The rhetoric for a vehicle that hasn't even been seen, from a company that lately has a miserable track record is way to much.Sorry rocky, you might was well claim that GM is going after Bugatti.

But talking the hypothetical demise of the performance entry level sedan category is ridiculous because GM might be releasing yet another gas thirsty so-so vehicle, while all the time watching the sales of the M5 go to zero.You have a strange way of looking at buying a car, a loaded 335i goes for $52K, but a base CTS-V goes for $52???? That's your comparison? Makes no sense. A loaded CTS-V will probably be about $65K to $70K.

"allargon","October 2006"," A CTS-V competes against the M3 in price, no i-drive based navigation and straight line performance (yawn). In luxury, handling, feel, etc. the M3 tends to win. The CTS-V doesn't have options. It's fully loaded with a 6-speed no poseurs allowed manual tranny and a non i-drive based navigation @ $52K.Singling out GM for releasing gas thirsty vehicles is a bit much. V10 M5's come with a gas guzzler tax, too. The CTS has lower mileage than the 330 (30 vs. 26), but the CTS uses non-premium gas.Neither one is really an entry level performance sedan considering that the M3 is a coupe.IMHO, the 2007 335i beats the 2007 CTS in everything but price (barely), reliability and rear seat room. (I test drove both the 330i w/ sport suspension and the CTS w/ 18"" wheels on the same day!) A 2007 3.6 V6 CTS with 18"" wheels and the sport suspension will have a MSRP north of $41k. I'm glad people brought up the CTS again in these discussions, but err... umm... not quite. (Somehow the Cadillac STS replaced the Audi A4 in the topic listings for this forum. Weird.)I'm looking forward to the new (future vehicle) 2008 CTS. However, I may get impatient and buy a 2007 G35 instead.

"designman","October 2006"," I'm a BMW owner and fan who is in it primarily for the driving characteristics just as many others are. However I find it hard to stay this way because most of their cars are ugly and cheap looking both in and out. The problem is that when everything is added up, there just aren't that many alternatives that I care for. No matter how I slice it, choosing a car today is a compromise for me and I probably blame it on marketing and the quest of auto manufacturers to outdo each other with frivolous features and feeble attempts at fashion. The only vehicles I would currently buy from BMW are the 3-series coupe and X3. I can&#146;t recall a time when the BMW pickins were so slim for me, especially in light of their product expansion. I have had the opportunity to drive, get up close and personal with many current BMWs and everytime I get back into my E39 530 I say to myself, man, it&#146;s incredible how cheap these cars feel today. Yes, they still drive great albeit somewhat differently but the sum total really tests my threshold of satisfaction. "

It has a boring design. It's a warmed over Century, with some angles reminding me of the Acura, but it doesn't look 'right'.

In the past I have stayed away from BMW's because a) they aren't as reliable as many cars, and b) I tend to keep cars a few years past the warranty period. I'm not saying that I think BMW 3-series cars are terrible from a reliability standpoint, just that they seem to be either at or slightly below ""average"" reliability and I am used to owning japanese cars that are generally rated well above ""average"".I agree with nyccarguy in that I am scared of owning a BMW with iDrive out of warranty. I know that at least one of the BMW faithful on these boards has stated that he only leases BMW's for a similar reason.Would an extended warranty make you guys comfortable with owning a BMW longer-term? Or is the issue more that routine maintenance is also very expensive and that is only covered for the first 4 years regardless of extended warranties? "
"kdshapiro","October 2006"," Tough question. You're talking to a person who buys extended maintainence on reliable Japanese products. I would get the extended maintenance agreement on a BMW also.I would also not use the three of four opinions here as a benchmark for the reliability of any manufacturer.Repairing a Lexus and BMW for a similiar problem will have similiar costs. Estimating a brake job on a 4year old 335 vs a 4 year old Corolla, will obviously have very different costs associated with it. If you believe the extended warranty will cover the areas prone to failure the extended warranty is a good deal. "
"circlew","October 2006"," quasiactuary,I really love the new coupes also. I leased an '06 330xi last December. As in very nameplate, the cars improve each year but also get more complex, ergo, warrantee gets more valuable as we move through the years.I would definatly get extended warrantee to cover ownership for any of the higher cost cars. They are expensive, however. If you calculate the cost of extended warrantee over an additional 4 year period and add in the routine stuff not covered, I'll extimate $100/month is fair guess over the period.You pay more to lease but do not pay extra for the maintenance since you trade before warrantee expiration. If you buy the car, you need to keep it at least 6 years to be ahead of the lease on average. But if you get a major problem without coverage, the pendulum swings the other way.I always purchased but changed to the lease option exactly because of this. Also, I know I pay more (depending on miles driven) but I do not worry about major issues and the BMW warrantee is top shelf. Then at the end, the fun is choosing a ""new and improved"" model.Have fun and hope you get the car you enjoy and best of luck. "

"captain2","October 2006"," entry level luxury performance sedan? Don't know that you can classify 'entry' without also talking price - is 50k+ for a 530, E350, or a GS meet all defintions of what most folks consider a 'luxury sports sedan' sure -- entry level not for most folks. Is even the small 330 pushing the price envelope. Probably. So really what you are left with are a few suitably powered FWD cars and a notable exception, the G35. And then, the dilemma, how can any car with 60% or more of its weight over its drive wheels be a true performance car. Acura has tried hard with the TL, ending up with ride sacrifices while still not eliminating the understeer endemic to the weight imbalance and the torque steer common to many well powered FWD sedans. Ditto for things like Maximas, Impala SS/GP.For my part, ending up with an Avalon Touring after shopping both the TL and G35, the Avalon and TL both at about 30k the G35 a few thousand more. The G35 definitely the only one that I would define as a performance car, it is a hoot to drive but at the price of the fit/finish and luxury levels found in the TL/Avalon. The TL, a muuch rougher ride - the Avalon the surprise I didn't anticipate - a car that will run with either of the other two (until the road gets really curvy), much larger and more comfortable, trading off some of that 'handling' for a far better ride. The Touring model definitely the trim line of choice, more tightly sprung and perhaps a little more 'fun'. Not sure though that 6 second 0-60 or 100 mph quarters necessarily makes it a 'performance' sedan though - don't think that is possible in a FWD car. "
"kdshapiro","October 2006"," The TL rougher than the G35? I disagree. But it goes to show you have the drive the cars yourself and not rely on someone elses opinion. I'm glad you like the Avalon, it is way too big for my taste. And you hit the nail on the head with the disclaimer...once you hit the curves. Lots of cars do well in a straight line.You are on target on price. Is350 the same as the 335, TL coming in at about $34, with the base G35 at $30Kish. Of course no one will ever get a base G35. "

All for about $32,000 probably. Add automatic, leather, keyless start, and metallic paint to the 335i sedan, and you're already looking at $43,100. "
"captain2","October 2006"," my purchase in the spring of 05 - both the TL and the G35 were hot sellers, the TL with maybe a 6-7% discount, the G35 about the same, the Avalon which I knew nothing about wasn't even on dealer lots yet and selling closer to sticker. Curse for those of us that end up wanting finer cars - demand has a way of keeping prices closer to sticker - could have gone to any of those 'Detroit' brands and gotten one of those 538%  discounts. Anyway the TL was the car I thought I wanted and was going to be about 30k no nav, the G35 to bring in up to the TL level needed a 3500.00 option package, the Avalon also 30k simlarily equipped to the TL. Can understand the comment about size, the Avalon certainly has a lot of that, the power and FE to boot, but a sports sedan it ain't. G35 certainly qualifies, my contention that it is the only truly 'entry level' sports sedan currently available unless you want to consider throw things like the Evo/WRX into the mix, but then I guess where is the 'luxury'.

There is something in suspension setup that none of the competitors were able to replicate. While 3 is a better handler then G it also feels better on the bumpy road, I would not say it&#146;s softer but defiantly not as bumpy as G. Actually, I just read article in Motor Trend and they confirmed my findings. I&#146;d say that G35 has the least comfortable ride in this segment. "
"pg48477","October 2006"," How did you figured that? "
"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," How did I figure it?Pretty simple math:330i - MSRP of 43k. I negotiated a sale price of 39.9k. If I bought the car that'd be 44k out the door.My lease was 485 a month for 36 months, for a total of 17.4k. At lease return my model was selling for 24k but the residual was 24.6k. That's a 19.6k hit.I see a $2200 difference there (not including loan interest if I didn't buy the BMW for cash). "
"pg48477","October 2006"," Still don&#146;t get why you use 44k as price if you buy and 39.9 if you lease.

At the end of the day, lease is more due to interest, all things being equal. P.S. I too prefer to lease but found it more expensive then buying for cash and then trading the car in for a new one. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," Still don&#146;t get why you use 44k as price if you buy and 39.9 if you lease.If buy you pay taxes. If you lease you pay taxes on the portion you use.

Buy the car, you're down 44k, lease the car and you pay only taxes on the portion you use.Taxes aside and lets say the selling price after 3 years is 24, would make the difference of 15.9 (39.9-24).No. You have to pay the taxes. No way around it. Not sure what planet you're on but if you buy a 40k car, you're paying those taxes up-front. P.S. I too prefer to lease but found it more expensive then buying for cash and then trading the car in for a new one.no way. If you negotiate a crappy lease, sure. But given BMW's propped up leasing model, I come out ahead easily on leasing. BMW overvalues their cars residuals and usually gives you a decent MF. Bimmers lose about 20% of their value in year 1 - taxes included because you can't avoid paying them on a purchase.Secondly, trading in a car you lose even more. That's giving thousands away. Trading-in a car you're talking about another 2-3k difference in price from private-party resale. Trade-in value of my 03 330i was hovering in the low 20s. I woulda taken a bath: as will any person who trades-in a late-model car to a dealership. "
"pg48477","October 2006"," Well, I guess we are on two different planets. If you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference, therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in. Second, the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in, for BMW that is. And please don&#146;t quote me KBB or Edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes. I spend my share on dealers auctions and I can assure you BMW in a good condition will bring good money. I can see you are very passionate about leasing and ED, there is no need to get upset if you perfect deal is not so perfect. Just go back to planet EarthJAgain, if you lease you always pay more, at lease the money factor if you are good negotiator. "

Other factors that allow for an 'apparently' good price include finance charge buydowns, something relatively new called 'market equalization' fees, adjsutable mileage allowances and fees, residual adjustments relative to the anticipated 'damages' done to the car at lease end. There is a reason why dealers prefer leasing - it is easier for them to get approved and much more profitable for them. Not to mention all those low mileage 'program' cars they get back to make even more of a killing on!Could never understand the logic of leasing unless, of course, you really don't drive much or really want a new car every 3 years or so. Many of my friends have cars on leases and will usually brag about that fictious lease 'sales' price, and then find halfway thru the lease or so that they can't use the car nearly as much as they want to, and ultimately are hit with mileage and/or damage chargebacks at lease end that forces the refinance of the residual on an actual purchase for several thousand more than what the car is really worth. Or is all rolled into another lease - a self-perpetuating problem, that sooner or later, has to be bought out of.In any event, although a good lease can minimize your monthly out-of-pocket, it will never be cheaper than an actual purchase, and a cash price remains really the only way to determine a car's actual sell price. And you are right, the only thing that dealers like better than late model trades is the service depts. - this is where they really make their money. "
"pg48477","October 2006"," Just one more point, in case of the lease bank owns the car not the dealer. In most cases the BANK will sell the car on the dealers auction, the price they get will eventually make up residual % you get at the purchase. So, in real life residual value equals the price on the dealers auction (or in other words &#147;trade in&#148;). In case of BMW bank, they usually charge low money factor, therefore their residuals are very accurate, otherwise they&#146;ll lose money, and trust me BANK will never loose their money.Not replying directly to you captain2, just continuing the trail. "
"jtla","October 2006"," Also not replying to you, pg48477, just continuing this thread.The true financial advantage on leasing comes from, as blueguydotcom pointed out, the saving on sales tax. Unfortunately, even this saving is often largely offset by the so-called acquisition fee ($600-$900) up front and termination fee ($350 to $600) at lease end. In some States, sales tax is levied on the selling price of the vehicle.Leasing can be a better deal than purchasing only when there is factory subsidy that is not available/applicable to purchase (for example, artificially high residual). Otherwise, lease is almost always more expensive than purchase. The reason is plain and simple: no dealer or bank would share with you the cost of ownership of a vehicle. "
"mikefm58","October 2006"," One more note here on this, where leasing is a definite advantage is if the vehicle is used as part of a business, such as a realtor or other sales person. There are distinct tax advantages of leasing versus an outright purchase for commercial vehicles.But for individuals, leasing is ""virtually 100%"" more expensive in the long run over a purchase. "
"circlew","October 2006"," I agree that lease is cheaper than the depreciation hit in re-sale value. My lease is 12,000 miles/3yrs. and will probably go for $800 for extra miles 4 months before lease end. The extra cost for lease vs. buy is because you need to lease twice vs. buying and keeping 6 years.If you buy and keep the car over 6 years, you probably are flirting with 100K so depreciation levels out in the later years but basically the maintenance/repair costs increase fast. The resale is low and hit is high vs. original cost.The savings in buying comes after year 6 but the car is basically getting tired in at least some major drive train parts. But if the car stays sound, you start saving in repair costs. "

The resale is low and hit is high vs. original cost any car these days should have minimal maintanence costs at 6 yrs/72000 miles, if that is the assumption on miles driven and length of loan. Unless, of course, you are driving something like a BMW or MB, which owners should trade off before the warranty/free service periods expire.A friend had an older 328 (before BMW had to offer their service program). Nothing really wrong with the car, took it in for the 40000 mile 'scheduled' service and got it back $2300.00 later - absurd - since when do 'simple' brake jobs cost $1200.00 and 'simple' tuneups $600.00! Although the German cars do maintain high values used, the gross dollar hit is ludricrous compared with most of the 'Japanese' makes - the reason why the lease rates tend to be much higher. But, in any case - most of the real money saved by purchasing is actually realized after the vehicle is paid off, so that from a financial standpoint it does make sense to accelerate that process as much as possible, even if your monthly bill is doubled. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," Well, I guess we are on two different planets. If you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference, therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in.That's dependent on state. In CA your trade-in does not count for squat on taxes. Trade in a 40k car for a 40k car and you're still down 4k on taxes. Second, the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in, for BMW that is.I've owned a couple BMWs now. There's a pervasive myth they don't lose much value. And please don&#146;t quote me KBB or Edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes.

"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," bet they are getting near retail for the 335i, right ? Check the bimmer boards. People have been getting over-invoice deals on the 335i already. BMWs are a commodity, just like a Honda Fit. Massive competition - essentially anyone paying MSRP for one is getting taken for a ride. "
"louiswei","October 2006"," This may not meant much but according to Edmunds...2007 BMW 335i (zip code: 30360, Metro Atlanta):MSRP: $41295 (including $695 destination charge)TMV: $41295 So yes, apparently for right now the new 3-coupe is selling around the sticker.I know people like blueguydotcom will come back with the ED option which allows one to get one below invoice. However, I think with the ED, one should also take the airplane ticket, hotel cost, and any misc cost into consideration. I am pretty sure that if one can get a good deal on the ticket and hotel the overall cost should still come below the non-ED price but it would not be that significant.It's not that people are lazy to pick up their cars in Europe. However, I don't like the idea that I have to wait 3 month (or is it 6?) for my car to arrive after I picked it up. Also, a trip to Europe is just not as attractive to me comparing to a trip to China or Taiwan. But that's just me. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," Even without ED you can get them for a bit over invoice. People are really myopic about saving some dough. Say you're in some po-dunk fly-over-state and the one BMW dealership won't budge on price. Check bimmer boards and find a large city nearby that does have competition. some email blasting will nail down deals quickly. Hop a JetBlue, Ted, SWA flight after you do the deal online/over-the-phone and pick up your car for a quick drive back. If that'll get you a BMW at $500-1000 over invoice v. MRP, that's worth it. Living in socal we've got BMW dealerships on all over. There's so much competition that a car like the 335i starts getting negotiated prices below MSRP before they're ever delivered. "
"louiswei","October 2006"," Oh, blueguy, I am pretty sure the 335i are flying out of the dealer lot with price below MSRP. Like I said, usually the Edmunds' TMVs are off for some reason. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the 335i are selling for about $1000 under MSRP. I know for people like you that's not that great of a deal but compare to many suckers whom are paying MSRP that's not that bad at all - especially for a hot car like 335i.I agree with you on that if people truly want to land a great deal they should shop around the coutry. When I bought my IS350 back in April I found out that I can get probably another $1000 to $1500 off the deal I got in Atlanta if I buy it from dealers in Cali. However, with the school and many interviews lining up back them, a trip to Cali to pick up the car just seems not logical to me. Also, since I was planning to finance my car for at least 4 years, $1000 difference (about 20 dollars per month) is just not that significant after all. The bottom line is: would I want to get a better deal than the one I got ($1500 off MSRP)? Yes. But after taking everything into consideration, it seems more reasonable for me to buy it from my local dealership. "
"habitat1","October 2006"," Two comments:(1) I agree that you need to draw the value line somewhere when it comes to saving money. My business partner, with a net worth in the solid 8 figure range, considered importing a Honda Accord from Canada a few years ago to save an extra $1,000 on the exchange rate. Needless to say, he's a great lawyer and investor in our company, but I handle the financial decisions. That example aside, I have found it unnecessary to go accross country or outside the country to do a little arbitrage bargaining.(2) Leasing vs. Buying: blueguydotcom may be an exception, but I always seem to have the strongest negotiating position when I can write a check for an in-stock car and dare the dealer to rip it up. Edmunds TMV on my 2002 S2000 was $36,000 (yes, $3,200 over MSRP). The Saturday before Thanksgiving in 2001, I walked out with one for $32k even. The discount on my 2005 911S Cab was even more substantial. At one year and 10,000 miles, I could sell it for, at worst, $8-9,000 less than I paid for it (about 50% of what the annual lease payments would be). I am in a lucky state that recognizes trade in values on taxes. I am of the general opinion that when you introduce another party to a transaction - i.e. a leasing company or financial institution - they need to make money to stay in business. If, in fact, they have a cost of capital that is significantly below mine, they might be able to do that and still offer me some value in return. But, for a lot of people, that internal cost of capital could be a 6%-7% home equity loan, with the interest being tax deductible. That's hard to beat. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," Habitat, dealers make less money if you pay cash for a car. It's actually a better deal for them to sell the car lower and get you on their financing. The bank pays them back instantly and they get a cut of the finance rate. Actually had a dealership tell me straight up if I financed through them and then paid off the loan instantly they'd sell me the car at a lower price. Weird but true.I totally agree that quite often leasing for the short-term buyer quite often really isn't a great deal without a tax deduction. But there are exceptions.  "

If the dealer makes MORE money if a buyer finances a car, that must mean the buyer is paying so much in financing costs as to allow the fiancing company to give a kickback to the dealer. And I agree, that may be the case. But when my cost of funds is under 4% after tax, I sure as hell am not going to pay 8%+ on a car loan or a lease money factor that translates to that kind of interest rate.I haven't tried the idea of financing a car so the dealer gets his cut up front and then paying the loan off immediately thereafter. But I suspect the financing company would get wise to this tactic pretty quickly and put the kabosh on it. Or have a substantial pre-payment penalty / loan fee to the buyer to cover the kickback.It's pretty simple, really. There is only one source of revenue in this equation - you the buyer. How many businesses do you want to support with your revenues? I don't even deal with sales people any more and, surprise, always get a better deal directly from the sale manager by cutting out that middle person. Again, I think we agree there are particular circumstances in which you can game the system to your advantage. I wouldn't mind sticking it to a finance company if it didn't cost me anything and the dealer gave me a piece of their kickback. But the payoff needs to be good enough or the free cocktails strong enough for me to spend a couple of hours with finance guy that probably struggled through high school math.  "

Based on the same reason, I would put Legacy before Passat as well.By the way, VW has discontinued the Phaeton in 2006 because it was just not selling with the ""VW"" badge. Why? Because people don't see VW as a luxury brand and they just can't justify to pay over $70K for a VW.

The early legend was an Accord based car. The MDX and Pilot are twins. And, arguably, the most singularly unique and innovatively engineered performance car to come out of all of Japan in the last decade was the HONDA S2000.That said, I don't disagree that VW doesn't belong in the same group you listed.

They hang on to the belief that the 3 series should have continued as an extension of the 2 door only 2002tii and original 320i. They look at every 3 series sedan with disdain. So are you sure you aren't trying to have it both ways? It would be a lot easier for BMW to maintain proper proportions and weight if they weren't trying to accomodate 4 doors and 4 6-footers. I don't think Halle Barry's legs would look too svelte if she also had to have the ability to carry you and me on her shoulders  "
"brightness04","October 2006"," Yikes! I was just trying to warm myself up to the idea of leasing one of those buggers after being thoroughly turned off by their unreliability many many years ago on two 5 series sedans. I'd rather have a car that delivers 80% at all time than delivering 100% 80% of the time but zero the remaing 20% of the time. Dr. Murphy is not kind in the allocation that 20%. "
"habitat1","October 2006"," And I guess I have to play devil's advocate with your math.If I was in the market for a mid-size luxury sports sedan today, my biggest challenge would be deciding whether or not the new 3 series was big enough or the 5 series would be required. Because, unfortunately there are NO other cars by Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, Acura, Infiniti or anyone else that offered the level of sport and performance that I am looking for. There is no ""80%"" alternative in my book, when it comes to my requirement of a crisp shifting manual transmission, nimble handling/tight steering, fun to drive luxury sports sedan.No disrespect to BGDC, but the idea that BMW's are built like crap and break down a lot is, in the words of someone else, pure BS. I have dozens of friends, business associates, neighbors, etc. that have late model BMW's and their experiences fall in line with what the surveys seem to show. BMW might not be ready to claim the reliability title form Lexus, but the differences are really relatively minimal. I assure you, they are not becoming Starbucks addicts in the waiting room of the BMW service departments. So, in my opinion, over the last 20 years, BMW (and even Porsche) have made significant strides to close the gap in relaibility with the best from Japan, while maintaining or increasing their lead in driving dynamics and performance. The math I would use is that you gan get 5% better reliability going to a the premium Japanese manufacturers, but give up 50% in terms of what makes the driving exprerience enjoyable for me when you compare the 335i and 550i 6-speed to any of their Japanese counterparts. I respect that other's would look at it differently. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," Find it funny how the rankings clearly show BMW is lagging in quality and reliability yet many BMW people insist they're not that far behind lexus. Here's a JD POwer report showing Lexus with something like 136 problems per 100 cars and BMW over 212. That, to me, is a massive difference. http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/charts/2006133a.gif "
"dewey","October 2006"," Statistics, statistics.Show me a desired result and I will show you a statistic to prove it!So now my question to you is how irritable these 212 problems are for BMW buyers? BMW's 212 problems compared to the 136 problems of a Lexus sounds quite significant but apparently it is not as significant as you may think.The latest Strategic Vision's survey on customer satisfaction ranks BMW owners as the most satisfied owners in the whole auto industry. In other words those 212 problems you point out are so minor that BMW owners still remain the most satisfied car owners in USA.Here are some details about the survey:San Diego-based Strategic Vision surveyed more than 64,000 people who purchased new vehicles from October 2005 to March 2006. Participants were questioned after 90 days of ownership. The study, separate from Strategic Vision's quality survey, tries to capture whether consumers believe they got their money's worth and factors in emotional components.Overall, BMW AG outperformed all companies, including Honda, but because it sells only luxury vehicles and the Mini sports coupe and convertible, it is not considered a full-line automaker.SOURCE:STRATEGIC VISIONIf I had your problems with BMWs I would flee to another automaker. But in my case I own two BMWs and so far (crossing my fingers) these past eight years I have not confronted major problems with them. And no I am not one of those types who buys cars mainly for their reliability nor am I one of those types who will tolerate a badly made lemon :lemon: "

I figure as long as it drives fine (once the new tires are on this weekend i'm sure the drive will improve drastically over the ride with those craptastic runflats), I'll drive the car. When the engine eventually breaks down or I return for my oil change - which ever comes first - I'll handle the other problems.Plus BMW's shown an inability to fix electrical problems. Failure of my AC and my comfort access would fall into the electrical category. No sense in dropping off the car, getting a wholly horrible loaner (X3, 325i or even worse some free rental) and then hearing the nitwits at BMW say, ""We can't fix this but we can disable this...""

"habitat1","October 2006"," ""Find it funny how the rankings clearly show BMW is lagging in quality and reliability yet many BMW people insist they're not that far behind lexus.""Yeah, and I find it funny how that same JD Powers study directly contradicts their other study, putting Porsche on top of Lexus: Porsche beats Lexus. And in this study, on about the 5th paragraph, you will find:&#147;Without considering both quality factors, one might fail to recognize vehicles that are, in fact, excellent in certain ways,&#148; said Ivers. &#147;For example, BMW vehicles have among the fewest defects and malfunctions, along with Toyota. But BMW approaches controls and displays in a way that creates some problems for customers, leading to more design-related problems overall than Toyota incurs. Look, if you are beholden to JD Powers, go ahead and trade your BMW in for a Mercury, Buick or Cadillac (#'s 2,3 & 4 in the survey you quote). And enjoy your ride. I'm just saying that, as far as my own broad based research, BMW is not ""massively"" behind the Japanese in quality or dependability. Maybe I'm too cynical to take any one piece of data too seriously, especially when a first year B-School student with a C+ in probablility and statistics could shoot so many holes in JD Powers that they'd be ranking Smith and Wesson ahead of Lexus. I can certainly appreciate your grudge against BMW if you've had bad personal experiences. But you may recall Consumer Reports rated the previous generation 5 series as the best car they ever rated. And the 99 they gave it has still not been surpassed by Lexus or anyone else. I'm sure you could shoot holes in that with a 44 Magnum, which is EXACTLY my point. "

"jzalkin","October 2006"," I went to the Miami Auto show last night and here are some of my thoughts:Infiniti:If you liked the previous G35, you will like the new one. If you did not - then the new car will probably not change your mind. The interior looks better (as do most newer Nissan's), but still seem a little off in terms of feel and flow. It is so hard to tell a G35 from a M35/45 in a glance - it takes a stare (will it help raise value of the G or cheapen the M? - time will tell)BMW:The new coupe is nice, but not that striking when it is surrounded by all other models. BMW interiors still seem to be a weak link of the car.Lexus:The new LS looks as a classier version of the 7 series. Interiors are nice, but each model seems to have the same feel from IS to LS. Just gets larger. It is easy to see how the new LS will retain loyalists and add a few sales based on the reaction the car was getting.Mercedes:Even the carpeting on their section was more plush than the others. High status, style without the BMW controversy and the sticker price to match. Jaguar:The new XK-R is great. Retains the beauty of the base model and makes it distinctive enough to show it is special. If the designer of this model works on the others - they may have something.Audi:VW and Audi are so much a like. Audi is loosing a little of its distinctiveness. No S8 there which was a let down. Audi lacked flair since the new model that they had was just a revised A4 Cab to have the new nose and engine. Anyone else dislike the new steering wheel also? It reminds me of a bumper car with the small round pad that sticks out. (I had an '04 A4 cab and loved that 3 spoke)Acura:The new MDX will be a hit - very nice. The S type TL did not get the attention that I thought it would. The TSX is an odd car - above a standard family car, but not quite the level of the BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, etc. The MDX was the only car that people were really checking out.Hyundai:Not relevant to this discussion, but they had the best models (humans) by far. Looked at the Santa Fe because one asked us if we wanted to hear about it. Actually a nice SUV - a brand on the upswing.Lincoln:Whoa, what are they thinking? The Navigator is horrible compared to the Cadillac, Chevy, and GMC.Mercury:They know how to dress up a Ford. The Milan is very nice for the money. "

Infiniti's G35 sedan, since its introduction, has possessed outstanding dynamics, brilliant styling and a low-rent price tag the Germans could only hope for. Now, with its engine fully updated, it's a true class leader.The G's revised 3.5-liter V6 makes an impressive 306 hp and 268 lb-ft of torque. But those numbers only tell part of the story. The rest becomes clear as the G's tach needle blasts straight past its old 6600-rpm redline on its way to a genuinely usable 7500 rpm. Those extra 900 revs allow the true enthusiast some serious involvement that would never happen with a lesser engine. Like, say, the 3.0-liter straight-6 in BMW's 330i.And the G will hold its own against the 3 in any handling showdown &#151; our slalom tests show only 0.3-mph difference between the two in the slalom.

"jjdow","October 2006"," First - thanks to all the posts here and in the other forums on BMW's. The 330i w/ Sport and Premium is my first Bimmer and I love it. I traded in a 6 yr old CLK430 and this is an upgrade for $15k + less. I almost allowed the RFT issue to keep me out of this car, but I'm glad I didn't. This car w/ Potenza's drives great and is quiet. I have 6K miles so far, and also have had no other reason to go to the dealer. My CLK would barely get 20K of miles on a set of tires, and I tried 3 different brands. That's to be expected w/ any car with staggered wheels that can't be rotated with these softer tires. If you dont have SP, then you can rotate and get more. The car is a little rough with the SP suspension and these tires on rough, patched up roads. But on a decent (not perfect) streets, and some of the new highways we have in Tx, this car is a dream to drive. Smooth, quiet, and it drives straight as an arrow without holding onto the wheel. It seems to drive better at 90 than 40. The cornering just at agreesive peeds is flat and smooth - awesome. Other points:1. As the car breaks-in, the quickness is improving. Its plenty quick, especially if you drive in manual.2. I really like the seats, and the adjustable air bladders on ht limbar and sides.3. I play my iPOD through the connector in the armwest - great soundquality!

"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," Night and day difference. Ride quality has improved greatly. The car's chassis is not upset by imperfections in the road and cacaphonous thudding that used to come through the cockpit from simple things like bots dots has now been muted.The responsive nature of the car is far closer to my e46 ZHP. I move the wheel and the car reacts instantly. The e90's slow-to-respond dynamics have been erased.Handling improved greatly. Suddenly corners come and go without any fuss. No more feeling the cruddy runflat tires flexing and bending in corners. no more muted feel through corners - you can now feel what the tires are doing. Most importantly, hitting a pavement junction or a dip at twice the speed limit no longer causes the car to skip sideways. It's a godsend to feel the road and yet not fear the hopping/skipping runflat tires create.I can't say what my mileage will be like but much lighter rolling stock should help.Additionally, the car just feels quicker and lighter on real tires.Best money I've spent on a car in a long time. RFTs suck. "

Besides even on a weekday its a hassel getting off the highway and get it fixed. It screws up your plans. Its like an air bag .. hopefully the need does not arise to use it but if you get into an accident then it better be there. I have had a flat tire on the highway and I realized how handy the full size spare was. Replaced it and I was on my way. I looked at the Acura TL/RL, Lexus GS300/350, Infiniti M35 and none of them have a full-size spare option. Its hard for me to think of buying a 40K car and not having a full size spare ... which is something so basic. I do not understand why auto-makers are doing this. Any thoughts ??? "

"habitat1","October 2006"," ""I do not understand why auto-makers are doing this. Any thoughts ???"" One reason is the unidirectional tires and staggered F/R tire sizes. Take a 550i sport for example. The front tires can't be interchanged with the rear, and the left and right sides are not interchangible since the tire tread is specifically designed to rotate in one direction. So, if you wanted to adequately cover all potential flats, you'd need to carry 4 full size spares. Another reason is the increased size of wheels and tires. When that 550i starts wearing 18/19"" wheels with 275 width rear tires, that makes the old spare wheel well in the trunk obsolete.What is unfortunate is that several cars really don't have the credentials to wear high performance low profile unidirectional tires on oversized rims, but do so simply to look more impressive. I haven't driven the new Lexus GS, but unless it's a dramatic departure form the previous model, this is NOT a performance sedan and does not have a suspension or chassis that requires high performance tires to tap the last bit of handling prowess. Frankly, it's a waste of good rubber. "

However, I am looking at a full size spare (FSS) as a backup / practical option compared to a donut. Granted none of them (FSS or donut) is going to satisfy the unidirectional requirement. But its a much better option than driving at 50 mph for the rest of the trip with a donut. I dont think driving with a un-matched unidirectional FSS for say 300 miles will make any damage to the vehicle. Infact Toyota Camry had a FSS option till 06 model. In 07 its not there. And Camry is no performance or sports car. Seems like the manufacturers are getting rid of it. My 2001 bmw 325xi has FSS standard but now the new 325xi dont even come with any spare. "

"habitat1","October 2006"," I can't imagine the FWD Camry ever came with uni-directional or staggered size tires, hence the option of a FSS made sense. My point was that the newer performance RWD sports cars and sport sedans often come with uni-diretional and staggered tires. Run of the mill family sedans generally don't. At some point BMW switched to run flats, which almost nobody is particularly happy with.As far as running a unidirectional tire ""backwards"", that is a no-no for both safety concerns and tire wear, from what I've read. A couple of years ago, a friend had his wheels balanced on a 545i and they accidentally interchanged the left and right front tires. He noticed that the car did not steer as precisely and track as straight on the highway, but kept driving on it for about two months (2,500 miles). When he then started noticing loader than usual road noise, he took it back to the dealership, where they realized the mistake. They gave him two new tires, without any prodding by him. Turns out that the wear going ""agianst the grain"" is considerably greater than going with the grain. Unidirectional tires often have an arrow on the sidewall showing which direction they are supposed to roll. If you see that arrow and its pointing backwards, you could be headed for trouble. "

"qbrozen","October 2006"," that's kinda funny.JUST going by the pics alone, the MB looks the least inviting to me. The audi looks pretty bad, too. The red '80s looking displays HAVE to go, IMHO. I'd agree the CTS is down there, too, though.I'd have to say the Infiniti looks the best to me, followed by the Lexus, then Bimmer, then TL (the acura has a nice layout, but the seat doesn't ""look"" very comfy).Again, this is based purely on those pics.I was going to grab a pic of a volvo interior and post it to add to the comparison ... but the inside shots make it look HORRIBLE by comparison. If it weren't for the fact I know the volvo is so darned comfortable, I would say they don't even belong in this group. "

"laurasdada","October 2006"," To me, both in pictures and real life, the CTS interior stands out. For the wrong reasons, of course. (and I feel the same way about the exterior). IMO, it is terrible. That center stack just oozes cheap and looks to be almost an afterthought. Just no flow to the CTS interior and isn't the steering wheel just a tad too large? I believe that Caddy is addressing this issue with the '07s, I've seen some pix (SRX) and looks to be a BIG improvement. I'm certain that I've read that Caddy acknowledges the low-rent perception of their interiors and will rectify that beginning with the '07s.I basically like all the rest (I own a TL) although the MB center stack is too busy. The BMW looks better in pix, or maybe it has grown on me? Although I still don't like the ""double-hood"" look. An analog clock is always a welcome, classy touch to me. I prefer wood to aluminum, the TL uses real aluminum but both ""Plood"" and faux carbon-fiber. But, the IS makes good use of the aluminum.Tops for me, well I bought the TL.

I personally like sharp crystal white color for gauges just like the IS's. I think TL's gauge is pretty decent too but I prefer white needles instead of TL's red. BMW has the most classic gauge, not as flashy as the others but it's easy to read. G's looks a bit busy to me but general layout is pretty good. Last but not least, C's gauge is just too blend, despite it looks like might be the easiest to read.Oh yeah, and there's the CTS's...BTW, is that a clock at the left bottom corner on CTS' gauge?

I don't know if I get to comment as I am mainly a lurker here (but a respectable lurker), but I think the TL and the IS are the most pleasing dashes - they are a little too lux for me, but they are soooothing. The Audi and BMW gauges are by far the best. There is something about no nonsense, somewhat retro teutonic guages that evoke high end machines to me. Wood interiors on these smaller German cars seem to clash with their bauhaus, glass and steel Messerschmidt effect. Purple and baby blue colors on gauges just seem like sacriledge to me. Except they fit perfectly on the G. For the life of me, I cannot figure out Infiniti's love of flashy, old lady-oriented interior glitz (that clock looks like a women's watch). Infiniti interiors spell Liberace and Myrtle Beach retirement communities for me. The Cadillac. Yes my fellow Americans, we have met the enemy and he is us.

"rolf2006","October 2006"," LEXUS IS 250&#149;	Excellent cost of ownership benefits fundamental to new Lexus IS &#149;	Class-leading insurance groups, from 12E &#149;	Major gains in standard servicing, maintenance and repair tabour time and costs &#149;	Designed for ease of repair &#149;	Exceptional residual values predicted by CAP Monitor - 47 per cent for IS 250 and 45 per cent for IS 250 SE after three years/60,000 miles If car-buying decisions depended on emotional factors alone, the new Lexus IS would prosper, with its distinctive dynamic styling, unmatched quality and exceptional driving performance. But most motorists have to take budget issues into consideration, too, and balance factors such as appearance and performance against the longer term impact of ownership on their finances.True to Lexus&#146;s unmatched attention to detail, the IS makes substantial advances in cost of ownership benefits, setting class-leading standards and making the new car an even stronger proposition than the previous generation model.Lexus has achieved all-round improvements in efficiency in the standard programme of servicing and maintenance for the IS&#146;s first 60,000 miles or three years. Compared to the previous generation model the contract servicing costs have been reduced by ?288 (for models running on 17-inch tyres), while the cumulative length of time required to do the work has fallen by more than three hours to 5.1 hours. This has been achieved through a series of measures, including the adoption of longer-life or maintenance-free components. These include:&#149;	Maintenance-free valve clearances &#149;	Transmission oil that does not require changing during the vehicle&#146;s lifetime &#149;	Air filter life extended from 30,000 to 40,000 miles &#149;	Engine coolant life extended from 30,000 to 100,000 miles &#149;	Brake pad replacement scheduled at 30,000 for front and 40,000 for rear &#149;	Engine uses mineral grade oil rather than expensive synthetic typeAnother important area in which the new Lexus IS excels compared to its principal rivals is in the cost of replacement parts. In the event of a typical front or rear collision, the repair parts costs for the Lexus work out substantially cheaper.For example, the combined cost of front-end elements, including bonnet, grille, bumper cover, wing, headlamp, radiator, front panel and air conditioning condenser, for the Audi A4 is almost 26 per cent greater than for the Lexus, while the Mercedes C-Class, Jaguar X-Type and BMW 3 Series range between 18 and 24 per cent more expensive. And it&#146;s a similar story where the cost of rear-end components are concerned, too.Should crash repairs be necessary, the job of replacement has been made simpler, for example by introducing a bolt-on rather than welded front section. And the vehicle&#146;s radiator and air conditioning condenser have been positioned so that they do not have to be removed for the repair to be effected, so coolant and refrigerant gas do not have to be replaced.These measures have had a positive impact on both the new IS&#146;s UK insurance ratings and early industry predictions for residual values.In insurance terms, the new IS is launched with class-leading ratings, improving the levels attained by most of its principal rivals by one or two groups. The IS 250 has a 13E classification and the SE, SE-L and Sport (arriving in 2006) are in Group 14E. The diesel-powered IS 220d, to be launched in January next year, has been given a 12E rating, with SE, SE-L and sport versions in Group 13E. These compare, for example, to Group 15E and 12E for the equivalent petrol and diesel powered Audi A4; 15E and 14E for the Jaguar X-TYPE and BMW 3 Series; and 16A and 13A for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Furthermore, the all-round strengths and appeal of the new IS are set to make it a wise buy in terms of its retained value. CAP Monitor has calculated a residual value of 47 per cent for the IS 250 and 45 per cent for the IS 250 SE, figures two per cent higher in each case than the equivalent BMW 3 Series model.http://www.carpages.co.uk/lexus/lexus-is-250-15-11-05.asp "

The interior is far better than the first generation with higher quality materials and fit/finish.The engine is smoother, more powerful, and has more top end. The handling feels more secure and less twitchy than the previous car. Like the previous version, high-speed driving is a pleasure. I am really looking forward to trying out the 6-speed manual, but those will not be here for a while. I have not had a chance to drive the new 335i sedan to see how it compares, but hopefully will be able to soon.

The styling inside and out as well as the performance are all just perfect for me. I don't drive on the edge of the car's abilities and I prefer something that isn't brutally hard in terms of the ride. The IS fits my preferences to a T. The new G35 isn't out yet here in Canada so I haven't had a chance to see or drive it. No doubt it will be great to drive from what the auto mags have said. Although the interior looks much improved I still prefer the IS's interior over the other cars that are in this discussion, no surprise since I chose it over the others. One big thing for me is the dealership experience. I am hopeful that Lexus will provide me with excellent service and quality. From the quality surveys done over the years I expect them to impress me rather than let me down as Acura has lately. "
"ckoll","October 2006"," For many cars, it is obvious that the model platform is shared across manufacturers under the same corporate umbrella. For example, I own a Acura TL and the platform it was built from is the same (or real close) to a Honda Accord. I can see the same relationship between a Toyota Camry and a Lexus ES330 (or 350?). I am curious if there is a ""shared"" platform for the Lexus IS250/350 and the Infiniti G35 Sedan? I've looked at these cars and cannot identify where the IS is built from within the Toyota family. And the G35 appears different from the Maxima. I think it would be great if someone could help me (and others) with understanding what platform these entry level luxury cars are built from so that we can decide between the upscale model or the less prestigious sibling. "
"louiswei","October 2006"," To answer some of your questions...IS250/350 shares the platform with the GS350/430/450h. Since it's a RWD platform I do NOT believe it is shared with any other Toyota products except MAYBE some RWD models which are only available in Japan.I do not have information on which other Nissan/Infiniti product shares the platform with G35 (the M maybe?).

"habitat1","October 2006"," IS250/350 shares the platform with the GS350/430/450h.But I believe you are incorrect on that one.  The IS has a 107.5"" wheelbase, nearly 5"" shorter than the GS's 112.2"". That's a pretty surefire indication they do not share the same platform.The TL and Accord share the same structural base ""platform"", but the suspension and chassis components are different, as are the engines, brakes, and many major mechanical components. The ES350 and Camry V6 are nearly mechanically identical - with the same platform, chassis, engine, etc.Whether this means anything depends upon your perspective. I think the G35 coupe is a commendable, nice handling 4 passenger coupe. But I think the 350Z is a sorry excuse for a ""sports car"", given it's bloated weight and relatively low revving engine that result from cost cutting and parts borrowing. I don't have any issue with our MDX sharing a few things in common with the Honda Pilot, but back when I owned a Honda S2000, I greatly appreciated that it was a completely ground up engineered sports car which borrowed nothing from the Honda/Acura spare parts bin.

It's not that I don't believe you it's just that first of all, the GS350 just started to arrive at the dealers not long ago and second, selling them at $8K off sticker just seems not the Lexus way to do it. Maybe it was one of those leftover GS300s that the dealer is trying to get rid of? Otherwise you really need to share your dealer with us. :P It is common that a top of the line entry lux is in the similar price range with the next-model-up's stripped down model. For example, a top of the line IS350 is about the same price as a bare-bone GS350. For me, since all I want is the IS350's awesome engine and Lexus' refine interior and I can care less about Mark-Levinson and radar cruise; I was able to get a somewhat stripped down IS350 for about $35K back in March. Many others here (likely blueguy) will tell you that if all you want is BMW's awesome driving dynamics you can get a 335i for about $37K(? help me out here you Bimmer guys) with ED (not including ticket and lodging of course).

"pegasuszz","October 2006"," Remember that the CPO programs were built to deal with the volume of cars coming off-lease. Mfs wanted to stop those from competing closely with new car sales *except* to the extent the mfr themselves can make money off the sale. So, CPO1. Raises the price of used vehicles, which makes new more attractive2. Raises residual values on new cars, which also makes the NEW vehicle sale more attractive2a. Because of 2, mfr can keep the MSRP up on new, and may avoid discounts or incentives. 3. When the mfr buys back off-lease cars, they can determine when + where they go back on market, again with an eye towards supporting new car sales. 4. The mfr gets a fee to place a car in the program. Notice that ""saving you money"" was not one of the business reason for creating the program.

"louiswei","October 2006"," Apparently there is a long history why us Southeasterners got screwed when purchasing a Toyota or Lexus.

Everywhere else in the country the dealers deal with Toyota/Lexus directly. The reason for that is way back in the 60's/70's when Toyota was trying to explore the Southeastern market they need some local support so today they are stuck with this ""Southeastern Distributor"".I know this is BS and I complained to my dealer when I was ordering my IS. My sales told me that if I was willing to wait 4 months then he can special order one for me and I can have whatever I want on it. I told him BS and just choose the basic option (18"" wheel and accessories). The only other options that I really want are the ventilated seats and HID lights.

Trust me I really test drive the BMW and G35 3 years ago when I bought my coupe. Each time when I test drive the cars sales person was sorry they came along for the drive because they are not used to driving these cars even close to their limits themselves.

They promote and sponsor driving schools so people can ""enjoy"" their cars more. Its like someone who likes Pontiacs and Camaros saying you don't see many European cars at Daytona or at Nascar events. Thats just what American auto makers do . If you go to most underground racing events around the world you wont see many European cars either but that does not mean they are not good cars or have good handling. Or because European cars do not appear in ""Fast and Furious"" movies and games they must not have good handling. If there are any performance driving schools in the East (Japan, Australia, etc) they are likely to have Japanese cars. In addition the cars you use as examples are in a different class as I would not compare a G35 coupe with an M3/M5 or Porsche.

"allargon","November 2006"," I will call the G35 cheap!I tested the new 2007 G35 sport today. I saw mousehair upholstery on the headliner and HARD plastic on the doors. I cannot believe the reviewers did not call Infiniti out for that, but they ripped Cadillac for it. (In fairness, Cadillac designers do need to be shot for the center stack of the outgoing CTS!)The car had good acceleration but it was still in break-in so had some hesitation on acceleration that will disappear with time. The analog clock in the middle is gorgeous and classy, IMHO. The manumatic worked well but was a little slow to downshift. The tachometer also seemed to be placed weirdly on the instrument panel, but that's a personal thing. It did not have German ""road feel"" but the steering was tight (Hint to Lexus engineers, add that!), and it handled greatly. The stereo was definitely not class leading. It worked. We could just leave it there. The Bluetooth worked.  I didn't bring my MP3 player. Moreover, I didn't test drive a system with nav to upload mp3's to the flash card. It was nice but definitely a bit more sport than luxury. It felt like a cheaper, more reliable BMW.All of the above was just MHO.HOST, might we add the Saab 9-3 to this forum instead of that $60K 15-speaker, full-size Cadillac STS? "

"stl540","November 2006"," I test drove the 2007 G35S 6MT and 335i SP 6MT yesterday. Here are my opinions.Exterior (Subjective area that I will not get into):G35S - I like the updated looks of the G35 compared to the previous gen335i &#150; I also like the looks of the 335i. Winner &#150; Draw (too subjective)Interior:G35S - The interior is also improved over the previous gen. Some of the interior plastic looks somewhat cheap, but taking the lower price into consideration, it looks fine. The interior is a nice improvement over the previous gen. The sport seats were comfortable, and the thicker steering wheel felt nice. I would have to get used to HVAC and radio controls, but they seem to be in a good position. I did find myself trying to turn up the radio with the temperature dial. Again, my unfamiliarity was the cause.335i &#150; Higher quality materials than the G. I do not care for the placement of the driver side window controls. Cup holders are odd, but functional. BMW is not known to provide good solutions for cup holders. HVAC and radio control were good. Winner &#150; Slight favor to BMW in terms so quality feel. Slight favor to G in terms of gadgets (hard drive for MP3, backup camera, CF capable, etc). Engine:G35S - I like the growl of the engine. It is powerful at higher RPMs. It did not have the same pull at lower RPMs as the 335i. Once the RPMs got up there, it pulled well. The lack of low-end torque was noticeable on the G.335i &#150; Engine sound was good. Slight (very slight) turbo lab. The torque is awesome at all RPMs (starting around 1500 RPM). The car was powerful at any RPM. I was very, very impressed with the pull at any speed. Felt like a V8.Winner: 335i. Tranny:G35S - I expected this to be wonderful, but I was disappointed. The shifter vibrated way too much at all RPMs, even at idle. It vibrated so much; I did not want to have my hand near it unless I needed to shift. The salesman told me this was normal. Other than that, the tranny shifted well.335i &#150; Shifted well. It did not have the uncontrolled vibrations like the G. Winner: 335iHandling:G35S - The car handled well. It required more effort to keep in line with more aggressive driving. I am sure the suspension is capable of good performance, but IMO it will also take more work on the driver&#146;s part to get there. The use of a LSD is a nice feature compared to the 335i. The stability control system shut down too hard when the wheels broke loose.335i &#150;It goes where you point it with little effort. I felt more in control of the car in nearly all situations. The stability control is much improved over previous gens. It did not shutdown the engine power as hard or easy as the previous gens or as the G. I also really like the feature where you can push the DTC button to allow more wheel slippage while still have the stability control kick in if the car gets completely out of control. This feature is not available in the G. Winner &#150; 335iMSRP Price:Winner - G35S &#150; The price is ~$8K lower than the 335i.Residual value: Winner &#150; 335i &#150; 4% higher resale than the G &#150; BMW only costs $1640 more over 3 years (if car was sold at the stated residuals). This is much less than the $8K initial price diff of MSRP. The cost difference will be higher (an adv for the G35) if finance changes are factored in to my calc. $45K * .61 = $27,450 resale after 3 years &#150; total depreciation = $17,550 $37K * .57 = $21,090 resale after 3 years &#150; total depreciation = $15,910Maintenance: Winner BMW &#150; no cost for 4 year/50K milesG35S estimated cost over 50K miles using the factory recommended service interval&#149;	3700 mile oil changes - $30/each = $390 for 13 oil changes&#149;	$300 service at 15K miles&#149;	$700 service at 30K miles&#149;	$300 service at 15K miles&#149;	$400 brakes at 30K miles &#150; estimated need&#149;	Total = $2090 over three years & 45K milesTCO: Draw: The 3 year TCO is nearly the same if finance charges are factored in. Beyond 3 years is unknown (at least by my quick calculations)I do not have an allegiance to a particular marquee. The comments above are my opinions. My final conclusion is the BMW is the better alternative for me. The G35 is a nice performing car and would be able to my needs for a high performance car if the 335i was not available. The driving dynamics in the BMW is much better (again, IMO) that I can justify the initial price difference. My sister-in-law and two friends have the G and love it. I am more of a driving enthusiast than them.My advice to others is to test drive both and buy the one that fits your driving style better. Do not focus on 0-60 and other stats because this is not normal driving. The stats offer a quick comparison, but there is much more to a car&#146;s performance than running stop light to stop light.Cheers! "

"cbanct","November 2006"," Excellent review !I am sure many Edmunds fans will appreciate your thoughtful input. My assesment after driving both cars is similar. Most peolple would be happy in either car. However, the distinguishing part is what I call the wow or smile factor.If you love to drive, then the 335i is the car. It makes me feel like a better driver, because it handles so well. I find myself smiling when driving the 335i. The pull when hitting the gas is exhilarating. The exhaust note on the 335i is music!The electronics in the 335i is nowhere close to the G35. If I decide to get the 335i I would have to get an after market navigation like the Pioneer systems. I wonder where the best place is to have this installed ? There are some concerns with the 335i, such as the run flat tires. I did not compare stereos. Has anyone done that ?cbanct "
"allargon","November 2006"," I agree with all the above except the resale part.

"dynamos","November 2006"," My 2 cents. I purchased a 07 G35 with Premium and auto. It was $11K less than a comparably equipped 335i. While BMW does give you free maintenance, they only change the oil every 15K miles, which turns out to be only about 3 service visits over 48K miles. Even with the synthetic oil I was never comfortable with the long service interval. Also, having owned both BMW and Infiniti, I will take the reliability of Infiniti over Bimmer any day. Further, Infiniti provides a 70K powertrain warranty compared to only 50K at BMW. Also, my experience is dealer service is much better from Infiniti--who provide a loan car for any service. Getting a service loaner at BMW is always a hassle. "
"stl540","November 2006"," Congrats on the new G. The three recommended visits over 45K miles for the 335i is a wonderful thing. Time is precious and spending unnecessary time at a dealer is not appealing to me.I was also hesistant on the l5K service interval. I posted the lab results of an oil change of my 540i a couple years ago. Here is the link: stl540, ""BMW 5-Series Sedans"" #8770, 18 Apr 2004 5:03 pm!keywords=allin%3Amsgtext%20limit%3ABMW%3A5%2520Series%20stl540%20oil%20change. The results exceeded my expectations and would lead one to believe that the engineers actually know what they are talking about.  I am surprised that Infiniti still recommends 3700 oil changes when many (if not most) manufacturers recommend 7K+ service intervals. Some car companies have been recommending a 15K mile interval over 7 years with success.Neither Infiniti nor BMW are known to be as reliable as Honda or Toyota. They both have their share of issues as they both push the envelope on technology much more than Hon or Toy. I have examples (some personal) on good and bad experiences of Infiniti and BMW. I had some major mechanical issues with my 540i outside of warranty. Fortunately my dealer was able to get them covered for me. A friend of mine who owns a 2003 G35 had his car in the shop quite a bit. I also have friends with BMW's and Infiniti's with higher mileage with minimal issues.My BMW dealer has been wonderful. I have a BMW loaner for any service visit. It definitely makes the experience much better. Glad to hear your Infiniti dealer treats you right.Happy driving. Enjoy the car. "
"stl540","November 2006"," All - Thanks for the comments. I am glad you enjoyed. I really enjoyed driving the machines!!

Cars are my passion and I love to drive. "
"dynamos","November 2006"," stl540: Thanks for the thoughful reply. As far as Honda reliability, Honda/Acura(Accord/TL) has experienced major automatic transmission issues over the last few years, but have been able to keep the news quiet. I had a Honda person comment to me(tongue-in-cheek) that they were having workers comp issues because of all of the mechanics back injuries caused from lifting the transmissions. Also, Toyota (Camry) has had ""sludge"" issues, but has also kept that out-of-the press. I owned a 740i which caused me to get to know the BMW service personnel way too well.  "
"stl540","November 2006"," I experienced a tranny failure in our 2002 Acura MDX at 78K miles. I was quoted $3500 to replace. The dealer stated the never see tranny failures of the beloved Acura brand. I took the car with me and did research (needless to say, I was not happy). It was not hard to find many others who experienced tranny failures on Honda/Acura for MY 2000-2002 around 60K to 80K by doing a quick Google search.After becoming more educated, I pushed back on the dealer and they got Honda to pay for parts and I paid for labor ($800). I was happy with the outcome, but not happy with the 'we never see this happen' remark. I personally know at least 4 other people who experienced tranny failures around 60K-80K on Honda/Acura.We purchased another Honda for my wife...a 2006 'mom mobile' (hope she does not read this comment  ). Besides the tranny failure, the Acura was rock solid until we sold it at 90K miles. I expect the Odyssey to do the same, w/o the tranny issue (fingers crossed). "
"nyccarguy","November 2006"," Congrats on the purchase of your new G35. Enjoy it. I've yet to see a new one on the road, but I like what I see in the pictures.There has been lots of debate for BMWs long service intervals. I know the reccomended service intervals have been lengthened since BMW started paying. That being said, BMW engineers are very smart people and I'm sure ther 15,000 mile estimate is somewhat on the conservative side (Porsche has 2 year/20,000 mile oil change intervals). My Dad currently has an '04 X5 3.0iA with 58,000 miles. His first oil change was not until 18,000 miles. Before his X5, he had a QX4 which was a nice truck. The convenience of longer oil change intervals is really nice for him.Just to clarify, BMW free maintenance doesn't just cover oil changes. It covers brake pads & rotors, brake fluid, windshield wipers, Xenon headlights just to name a few things. "

And, if I'm not mistaken, the A6 cannot even be ordered with a manual transmission. I test drove the S4 and M3 before electing to get a 911 and the M3 was three times the driver's car that the S4 was. BMW's may be more plentiful on the roads, but I consider that a testiment to thier success in delivering substance.

"g35new","November 2006"," Juat purchased a G35s. Had a 2002Cic. This is not an attempt to compare apples to apples. The 330 had excellent handling and performance. Great low end accelration. My issues with the car were:1) The engine was eating more and more oil between oil changes - I had to add 1.5 quarts (in small doses) after my last oil change and still have another 4k left until the next recommended oil change2) Interior quality issues: buttons for the windows had broken, the little pop out tray above the ashtray would not go in/out properly, the steering wheel wrapping was coming loose signficantly....and it was starting to look dated3) Exterior items - The driver side window would not always adjust up and down properly. Consequently it would get caught in the up position against the soft top when the door was closed - if you have tried a bimmer convertible you know what I mean.4) The tires, for me, were magnets for any piece of metal on the road...mutiple blowouts, etc.5) The sport seats did not hold up very well and became uncomfortable as the car agedDespite all that, I loved the car. I do think people should use caution and automatically say the interior is far superior on a BMW.So the new G35s is exciting and I am still trying to figure out how all the gagdets work. It handles well, accelration is good...Neither quite at the 330 level, but quite acceptable. "

The salesman warned me against testing the bluetooth since I had an older, unupdated Razr.How did it drive? There were obvious signs of needing a break-in with the tranny since the car only had 70 miles on it. It hesistated a little between gearshifts (in fully auto mode). I experienced this same issue with the 5-speeds on the G35 and the CTS. Acceleration was good. However, it didn't feel as powerful as the G35 or even the 2006 330i. The car felt a little heavy, but not as heavy as the 2007 CTS. I tried to gun it onto a freeway onramp. I was expecting to have to grab the steering wheel, but I got no torque steer. I guess that new anti-torque steer works.Handling was good. (It was no 3 series.) I never got the traction control to engage. I drove it down Spicewood. (Those of you in Austin know that road well.) It took the curves without issue. The suspension handled dips wonderfully. The steering actually had a little bit of ""road feel"". I was surprised. I got more feedback from the TL type-S than I did from the G35 Sport. :confuse: The paddle shifters IMMEDIATELY downshifted like they were supposed to. Interior? This was my favorite interior. All due respect to BMW and Cadillac, but I hated their Spartan interiors. There were some cheap touches like hard plastic INSIDE the cup holders and on the REAR of the trunk passthrough. I'm not sure what was up with those pull out pockets on the back of the front seats. The center stack was wonderful with that carbon fiber look. The front seat was the most comfortable in this class and the second most roomy behind the CTS. The CTS seats were HARD!The front seats of the G35, Lexus, Mercedes and Audi felt claustrophobic to me. It wasn't just headroom. My arms felt pushed in, and I'm only 5'7"". The above cars (especially the A4) seem like they are made for long and lanky types or short and skinny. You don't have to be a fat person to want more arm room if you're at all broad shouldered. Sorry, I had to rant. The ride? DiSCLAIMER: I haven't driven the new 335, A4, 9-3 or C-class yet. The TL-S had the second softest ride behind the Lexus IS350 (non-sport).That's my mini-review. :blush: "

"edwardsf","November 2006"," A lot of these cars are not ""entry"" level luxury performance sedans. The A4 3.0 and the 335 (and the C350), while in the smallest size of sedan for their companies are themselves not entry level cars. Their engines (6 cylinder) are a step up from the entry level and their cost is rarely below $40,000. The A4 2.0T, C230 and the 328 are ""entry level"" sports sedans. And while all three have fabulous German engineering and style and Teutonic road feel and handling, they do not have powerful 6 cylinder engines that have low 0-60 times (the 328 does have a nice but not super powerful 6 cylinder). Of course, few folks ever go 0-60 except on a race track, so their 45-60 and 55-75 times are probably more important and those 3 all have great torque in that range. But if you demand race track times, that leaves only 2 Japanese cars as entry level luxury performance sedans that can be purchased with a 6 cylinder that are 0-60 screamers that can be had for less than $34,000. (The IS 350 is around $40k.) So, it is TL vs. G35 and that makes it easy - buy the one you prefer driving. In the meantime, a few facts follow: They are completely different driving cars in that the G is rear wheel drive and thus handles better in dry conditions. The TL is about as fast, and has better reliability, more usable tech toys, much better gas mileage and lower emissions. I would posit a couple of personal comments having test driven almost all of them; the German cars are more agile and have better road feel. The TL and the ISs have more supple rides. The exterior on the G35 is better than the somewhat staid TL but the G35 interior looks like it is made for Liberace. They are all wonderful, fast, sexy cars despite the sniffing of a couple of posters (one of whom seem to prefer Fords, like the Mazda3). "
"allargon","November 2006"," According to Consumer Reports, the Saab 9-5 is more reliable than the e46 BMW's. However, the e90 3 series has way fewer black dots. The 335 is too new for anyone to draw any conclusions.However, the 9-5 isn't considered the entry level vehicle. The Epsilon based 9-3 is. It's not considered reliable at all by CR even though its platform cousins, the Pontiac G6 and the Chevrolet Malibu Maxx are. "

"laurasdada","November 2006"," Hello, Edward:I agree with most of your comments on G35 vs. TL. In fact, for those reasons (and a few more) the TL was the car for me. Gotta disagree with your comments (and neither of us is wrong, of course) in that I find the TL to be a very handsome, aggressive and somewhat understated design from almost any angle. The G, while not unnattracive (like the overdone, overwrought, overbaked CTS!) to me appears just a bit too tall and narrow on the exterior with a rear view only a mother could love. I'd give the TL a 9, the G a 7.Viva la difference! "

IMHO, until the M3 gets redesigned the 335i is an awesome value compared to the M3. Insofar as maintenance is concerned BMW offers a 4yr- 50k mile maintenance free plan. Acura has made a serious attempt in providing luxury with its TL. How didn't it feel ""luxury"" to you?

"edwardsf","November 2006"," I think they are both great looking cars. And yes, the TL is more understated. I am thinking of three cars myself: TL, A4 2.0T, and a Suburu Legacy GT wagon. Note that the G is not there. I don't like its interior and find it cramped (I am 6-3). I think the Legacy is the most nimble and fun to drive of the three but don't like its gas mileage. The A4, TL and 328 are really quite remarkable in that they are performance sedans with 30+ mpg on the highway. The TL is an amazing package in that it also has very user friendly tech AND reliablity. "
"blueguydotcom","November 2006"," Stopped by a dealer and drove the G35S today. Hmmm. Interior materials are big step up. The car feels more solid, refined and really planted (if not heavy). some thoughts:Slight hesitation on acceleration. Engine is really quiet.No real NVH from the redesigned 3.5 and chassis.At speed the 5 speed auto is okay but the car feels incorrectly geared.Auto paddle response was okay but still too slow for my tastes.They didn't have a 6 speed manual on the lot.Acceleration was decent but not mindblowing. The car felt a bit more muscular than my weak-kneed 2006 330i. Steering felt heavy at all speeds - okay but a tad too muted during spirited moves.Interior was quite cramped - what happened to the wide-open interior of the last gen? This is more cockpit-like but in an overly snug way. I'm five-seven and 145 lbs and the G35 felt way too tight.Seats blow majorly. They're soft, poorly bolstered (even with controls used to tighten bolsters), feel flimsy and are not comfortable for even short drives.LCD display is worthless during the day. At full brightness it was still hard to read (20/20 vision).Soft ride and compliant on all road surfaces but tons of road roar.Overall - I liked the look the exterior. Better interior materials. More upscale. But the car has lost its edgier character, feeling more sedate, buttoned-down and even more muted and removed than the e90.If I could change my list from the other day the G35S with automatic would be on the side of ""wouldn't consider."" Could a manual change the character that much? Maybe. I will have to try the manual version eventually but it's hard to believe that the tranny could make a car feel so wrong. Then again, an automatic e90/e46 3 series feels like absolute, unresponsive garbage to me too.BTW, while at my BMW dealer last night I looked over the 3 series coupe with my girlfriend. We agreed, it's one boring, lame looking car. I didn't want to drive the 335i as they didn't have a manual on the lot and I would probably want to trade my woefully underpowered 330i for it immediately.Right now if price were an issue - 30k or under:GTIA3328Under 40k:335 "

But to hear a 'smaller' guy (?) has trouble getting comfortable in that cockpit makes me wonder about the size of the engineers designing the car in the first place. Smaller Japanese homeys?Actually the 3 series is the same way with me - kinda tight. The TL is the clear choice for not banging your knees into the door and center stack constantly. "
"plekto","November 2006"," First off, my prices that I quoted were all from carsdirect.com and are as such, verifiable.Secondly, It's called REBATES AND INCVENTIVES. That's how a 9-5 and a S60 can get down to such silly prices.Thirdly, Manual transmission is a must. Almost every one of these cars go from a rocket to your uncle's highway float-o-mobile(sm) when they are hampered with the automatic. Nowhere is it more evident, though, than in the Cadillac CTS. If you can't learn stickshift, just get a used midsize luxo-barge and be happy, because nothing under $30K(with an automatic) exists that I'd consider ""luxury"" and ""performance"".Fourth, Those ultra-small cars almost all universally fail the ""luxury"" definition as they are cramped inside. There's nothing ""luxury"" to me if I feel like a sardine while I'm in it. Compare a S40 to a S60. Who cares wwhat Volvo calls it, it's not a luxury car. Neither is the A4 or most of the rest. Sure, they're MADE by luxury brands, but as their entry-level offering, it's not enough to have the name on it. Even stuffing a bigger 6 cylinder engine won't most of the time as well. My ideal for luxury is an old mid 90's S-class. While none of these come close to that level, to be sure, I feel that they should still exhibit some of the qualities in part to be considered ""luxury"". And claustrophobic is the anthesis of luxury in my book. What ever happened to having a nice upright well-laid out interior? I'd much rather drive an old 80's BMW than most of these things. I'm 5'7"" and about 160lbd. Pretty ""normal"", and when I turn the wheel hard(hand over hand technique)and my left elbow hits the window, it's just not right. Oh - while we're on the S60, I said a bare-bones T5 model with the bigger engine. Under 30K and worth every penny. Why NOT get ""not entry level"" for the same price?A few comments about some of the cars:The reality is that the A4 is a maintainence nightmare. When I said they have to pull the engine halfway out to service it, I wasn't joking. That adds up to very pricey BMW-like maintainence. The Cadillac Catera also had this exact same problem. Oh - and a minor point - can someone please smack Audi upside their heads' over the joke of a cupholder?The BMW is a pathetic little thing like ths IS250 is. Not enough power and not even close to the M3(or even the upper-end) model that made the entire line famous. And at under 30K, it's bare-bone at that. To me, it screams ""Mercedes 190"" to me.The RX-8 - no bling - not luxury at all, but it is a sedan(I count 4 doors with their own hinges). I thought I'd add this since it represents the most RWD acceleration and handling that $25K(after rebates and incentves of course) can buy you.The G35 - Yes, you too noticed how the old models are better - the new one is like they are trying to copy a 350Z. Sigh. But the older generation with the manual gearbox is a joy to drive.The CTS with the 3.6VVT engine and stickshift is an astounding machine. A bit ugly(okay, a LOT UGLY), but with 6 speeds and 255HP, plus almost all of its torque available at 1600-2000rpm, it'll suck you back into your seat like nothing else will for the price. Driving it, it reminded me of a softer-sprung upper-end 3 series or a new IS300. Sure, it has less HP, but it hits maximum torque at half the rpms as well, so it pulls hard like a turbo-diesel. All in all, none of them really fit the criteria perfectly. Though, the S60 is probably the closest. But it's not really a ""fair"" comparison, either, as it's not entry-level. Gotta love rebates  "
"kdshapiro","November 2006"," None of these cars are luxury cars. The segment is entry level luxury sport sedans. Manufacturers who make luxury automobiles, these are the bottom of the heap. Last I looked Volvo or Mazda don't make luxury vehicles.Rebates and incentives will be gone in a few months for 2006 models. It's a pricing anomaly, much like Black Friday. Comparing a 2006 Volvo outgoing model with a new 2007 335i is ludicrous. The 335i is king of the entry level sport sedan. Fastest, most planted, best looking. To expensive? A Camry or Accord is the ticket. I would rather pay $43K for a 335 than whatever for an S60. So would a lot of people I gather.Of course, the 335i may not be right for you for a variety of reasons, none of which has to do with it's performance, unless you're afraid of it's 4.7 seconds to 60.One more thing - the TMV price according to Edmunds is on par for the S60 vs 335i. Comparing the consumer ratings however, one is 9.5 the other is 7.7. Can you guess which rating belongs to which car?I tried to do my car internet purchase. I tried carsdirect.com, I ended up by not using them. I don't consider them to be the authority on pricing. "
"plekto","November 2006"," Yet their prices are legitimate enough. Actually, you can haggle quite a better deal on many of the cars if you want - I just use them as an example of ""average"" pricing for those who don't want to haggle or drive around.Of course the BMW is going to be more favorable, but you can't get(still new) 2006 BMW for $26,400. The S60 T5, which isn't even their lowest end model is the same price as a Camry V6. I don't see Mercedes or BMW or Lexus offering those sorts of deals. And it's NOT ""black Friday"" - it's a fact of life for GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mistubishi, Mazda, and many others. For 3-4 months out of the year, you can get silly low prices on their leftover stock. That's not one weekend. It's roughly a third of the entire year, and when most sane people buy their new cars.(leases are totally seperate).As for the S60, it's certainly more luxurious than the others. The original poster wanted a luxury sedan that was sporty and luxurious for under 30K. This was different than the topic of this group, but we replied anyways. It's a higher sert of criteria that he was looking for. And I suspect that the S60 will be a better solution than an A4, as he seemed to want something a bit larger than a crackerbox if he could manage it. "

"edwardsf","November 2006"," Since you are a short guy, let me add a little bit of normal to large guy perspective. I am 6-2, with a long torso, meaning that most cars have poor headroom or vision for me. The S60 has has a raked roof and I can't see well out of it. The Lexus, 3 series, and the G35 all have similar headroom or vision problems. The A4, C230 and TL all have more headroom and better vision for me. I have driven an S60 - extensively - from SF to Tahoe and back under all conditions. It is a good car. It has nice seats and even a usable back seat. But it does not perform  like the A4 2.0T or the 3 series or the G or .... It does not handle as well as any of those cars and it is not nearly as nimble and it does not have as much midrange usuable torque passing someone going up Highway 50 at 5000 ft as even my 97 Saab 900SE. But you can go on about E series and 7 series in the ENTRY performance  level thread. And you can go on about poor reliability of A4s (directly contradicted by Consumer Repots) and something you made up about engines bays (the S4 has a 4.2  in it so your claims are really bogus). But the reality is that you probably don't really care about helping out a buyer or fairly discussing ENTRY level luxury perfomance cars. You seem to simply want crow about how great your S60 is. Again, all the cars discussed in this car are good cars. Maybe if you tried driving more than one of them, you might see the light. That is, if you can see over the dash. "

"kdshapiro","November 2006"," ""i agree with you about mazda ... but volvo??""Maybe you are right. But, I don't think of Volvo as a luxury car maker, in not the same way as Infiniti or Acura. Infiniti has a high end model, Acura has a high-end model. What is Volvos' high-end model, the S60? It's the same MSRP as a 3 series. And Saab? Even though Saab is on the list as an entry level vehicle, I don't think of them as being manufacturers of luxury automobiles. "
"kyfdx","November 2006"," I still see Volvo as a luxury nameplate.. The S80 stickers up into the high '40s and the XC90 goes as high as $57K.. They are definitely in the same league as Acura.. Some nice cars and some warmed over Hondas (Fords). "
"plekto","November 2006"," Volvo IS like Lexus and Infinity. They just dropped their budget-line back in the early 90s and never looked back.(ie - the 700 and 240 series).The 850 Turbo was one of the top three luxury sports sedans of the 90s - easily competing with the 3 series of the time.The S60 has more rounded sheetmetal, but it's still the same 850 at heart. A bit softer and more luxurious, but still very much a step up from a Camry, Honda, Buick, Misubishi, and so on. Plus, it handles superbly. Very ""European"" feel when you're driving it. Oh, and it's safe as a tank. The last of the Swedish designs as well. In a few years, Ford will have gutted it and it'll be a re-badged Mercury. But for now, it's a good alternative to the overpriced stuff from Japan. "
"kdshapiro","November 2006","  ""the XC90 goes as high as $57K""The highest MSRP vehicle in Volvo's space is not even sedan? This is a differentiator between Volvo and the others and the reason I don't view Volvo as a serious luxury manufacturer. In other words, at least in my view, you are one or you are not. Leather seats do not a luxury manufacturer make. "
"kdshapiro","November 2006"," They are nose heavy and handle as such. No balance to them. "
"plekto","November 2006"," Volvo's early history is pretty easy to research, so I'll leave that out. What made them famous, though, was how they copied Mercedes' technology during the 60s, 70s and 80s - and reproduced it for 2/3 of the cost.Mercedes came up with nearly every safety invention that Volvo got its reputation for first - just who could afford a $12-15K sedan in 1967? Volvo cost a lot less and offered the same safety(and preformance) This is why I have always considered them to be a luxury maker at heart. They are(or were) the European version of Buick to Mercedes' Cadillac.Other than the 240 and 700 series(plus some ill-fated budget cars in Europe like the 300 series), their cars have always been aimed at providing a working-man's luxury alternative, exactly like Lexus started off as. Why buy Mercedes and BMW when Lexus offered 75-80% for half the price? See, I see four segements in the market.1:True budget. Aveo and Yaris and the like - you get a box that gets you areound.2:Average car - about 60-70% of the market.3:Budget luxury. Lexus, Infinity, Volvo, and so on.4:True luxury. Mercedes, Bentley, Austin Martin, BMW, Lotus, Saleen, and all the rest. Stuff us working class people usually can't afford.Now, there is some overlap between #3 and #4, like the Mercedes C class and the top-end Lexus models, but when someone posts here about wanting ""luxury"" and sets a low price-limit, it's clear that they are like 99% of us. They are really talking about category #3. And Volvo and Saab belong there.(the 9-2 aside - nobody wants a Saabaru) "

BUT, IMHO it's a little humorous when you make generalizations about the performance aspect of the Volvo as well as the Japanese counterparts being overpriced. "
"fedlawman","November 2006"," I agree that Volvo is not a ""luxury brand"" compared to Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, etc. in that their top level car, the S80, doesn't compare to the Lexus LS, M-B S-Class,or BMW 7-series. No, I'd put the S80 closer to the Audi A6, and Acura RL kind of cars.I have to disagree that Volvo is not a ""luxury brand"" in the general sense. I'd say they are a ""near-luxury"" brand, most similar to Saab and Acura in market segment. Volvo's are well built, safe, and luxurious cars, but they don't come close to mid and top level Lexus or Mercedes cars.Actually, I think Volvo's are basically European Buicks. They are soft, comfortable touring cars with high-quality materials and luxury touches, but they are FWD and don't have any sporting aspirations at all (except for the ""R"" cars). Driving experience wise, I'd say they are very similar to the Honda Accord (crisp but not sporty handling with light overboosted steering and little road feel). I love my Volvo for what it is - a smooth, quiet, comfortable touring car with European flair and luxury appointments. But I don't pretend for a second that it is ""fun to drive"" or ""sporty."" It's not - it's a really nice Buick. "

"fedlawman","November 2006"," I actually prefer the Lexus LS to the Mercedes S-Class. I know it's personal, but I find the Lexus appointments to be softer and warmer, which is nice. The Mercedes is fantastic, but tends to be more on the hard, Teutonic side of luxury.Time has also shown that the LS is a very, very stout car. Look at how many early 90's LS400's you still see on the road. Most of them look as good as the day they drove off the showroom floor.I know if I was looking for a luxurious used car, I'd buy a 95 LS400 before a 95 S420 in a heartbeat. "

Yes, compared to a Buick, it's ""sporty"" - but then again, at $25-6K(depending on the engine choice)for a 2006, it comes in way WAY under the price of a C class or 3 series or anything Lexus makes.

The Volvo has a 40 HP deficit, requires premium fuel, has a less sophisticated suspension (McPherson struts), 16"" wheels (vs Accord 17's), and lacks Stability Control (optional on Volvo, standard on Accord). The Honda also has the advantage of better predicted reliability and better resale.What exactly does the Volvo S60 offer that makes it more attractive than the Accord?Edit: Yes, I know about incentives on 2006 Volvo models. S60 invoice is $28,800 minus $5000 dealer cash equals $23,800. 2006 Accord LX-V6 invoice is $22,600 minus $750 dealer cash equals $21,850 - still $2000 cheaper than the Volvo. "

"flash11","November 2006"," Hi Plekto.Just went shopping this weekend. Went to a car mall (12 manufacturers side by side dealerships) I test drove every car on the list you said were the best entry level lux-perform. sedans for the money under $30K. Was not totally impressed with any model of BMW and Mercedes. I found they were extremely overpriced for what you got inside and out and I don't suggest to anyone on this forum to consider those makes unless you want to pay $5K to $10K more just to own the name. BMW and Mercedes ride was far less luxurious than I expected for the quality of car I was expecting to get at $30K (328xi, C230). You may be suprised at what I found...The top 5 best bang for your buck Lux-Perform sedans under $30K range of cars when comparing 4 major factors equally-Perfamance-ie.acceleration, speed, suspension, braking, solidness at high speeds.Luxury-was the interior comfortable,noisy?,pleasing to the eye,ergonomically designed, did it feel good.Options given at the price(no one gets a stipper sorry !)Price-the lower the price the better without sacrificing quality and included the salesmans attitude of willingness to deal and give good service after purchase.Here is what I found:#1 best choice- Lincoln MKZ-why, price was at $29K with several options thrown in, 3.5L V6 with 263 hp, beautiful car inside and out,utter ecstasy for the price, found the salesman willing to throw in extras and bargain,with speed and luxury that beats any entry level BMW or Mercedes in its price range. Sorry BMW and Mercedes !#2 best choice-2007 Ford Fusion-their top midsized sedan was surprisingly luxurious,fully loaded with beautiful leather (liked the stitching) and had every option imaginable, and has a 240 hp engine for the price $27K. Speed, acceleration and handling were very nice. The salesman was willing to go lower in price and bargained for service 6 year extended bumper to bumper warantee. My only complaint was that I did not like the way the grille looked.#3-Volvo S60 R-test drove a 2 year old-fully loaded-with orange colored luxurious leather-not many options inside but it handled nicely at higher speeds, the salesman was willing to bargain and my impression is Volvo is a good buy for the price-$29K bargaining price on a 2 y.o.#4-Infinity G35-1 y.o. with few options, beautiful car but found out people are rushing to trade in their G35's for other cars-so is this a car that looks good but does not meet up to the drivers expectations after several months of use ?? Found it hard to bargain the price down without sacrificing options $29K. #5-2007 Sebring Limited 3.5L-$29K fully loaded every option available, this car has 235hp,Westgate Chrysler in Indianapolis just got its first one this weekend, handled very well for the price, sporty and luxurious leather interior and nice touch screen navigation/satelite radio entertainment center. Really liked this car. "

And, just as you say the S80 is the highest in the volvo lineup, so is the RL for Acura and M45 for Infiniti.

"rockylee","November 2006"," Well I have seen several photo's of both the LS and Audi A8, and have in fact read several tests and reviews on all of them. The LS, and A8, have a few features not found on the Volvo S80. However Volvo, has a few safety gadgets not found on either the LS or A8. The S80 also costs $30K less and has a way better interior than both the LS and A8. It just might be the best ever in my eyes. The engine advantage goes to Audi and Lexus. The exterior styling goes to Volvo also. The Lexus, as fintail would say is numb. The Audi A8, and Volvo S80's driving dynamics are a toss-up. The A8 has a more firm ride and the Volvo, has the 4-C's suspension which gives it a wide range. I guess we could call that a toss up ? So the question is this is the A8 and Lexus LS really worth $30K more than the Volvo S60. For me, no-way-Jose ! I guess for some the extra $30+K buys you status.

People who buy these cars, don't blink twice about the price and Lexus, Audi and BMW sell cars at this price, because 1. there is a market, and 2. they can.And I don't give a win to the ugly S80 on either style or safety.

I don't have to wear a designers name on my butt for self-confidence and that's all you are doing with the LS or A8 IMHO. The bottom line is that the S80 is NOT in the same class as the A8 and LS size-wise, feature-wise and luxuriously-wise. Agree the Volvo S80, beats both of them hands down style- wise, feature-wise I give a slight edge to the LS 460. The Audi A8, is still 5 years behind in gadgetology. luxuriously-wise, well that depends on what you want ? If you want conservative 'more of the same' buy the Lexus. If you like BMW's latest designs you will also like the Audi A8 also. If you want something modern looking that is pleasing to the eye you will pocket the $30+K and drive a Volvo S80.

Mazda, btw, is my top pick for value for your money lately. The 6 is a very good car and a reason why you shouldn't buy a Hyundai.

I drove the BMW 328xi, and the MB C230, are they considered in this class of car ? If they are then for sure the Lincoln MKZ surpasses them in quality, performance, luxury, standard options, price, and long term maintenance costs and deserves to be mentioned here. It is a midsized four seater sedan with 263hp. Overall it is a better car. As a matter of fact I believe that it is underrated and should be seriously taken into consideration here. I encountered this attitude with the salesman at MB, who does not consider any North American product in MB's class, seems narrow minded especially in the face of the facts. The Lincoln MKX is a great car for $29K, and oh, it comes in AWD at $31K since that seems to be a factor here, FWD=bad, cheap, low quality ?? Not sure why, I think Lincoln has outdone itself, good Job !What dissappointed me was the Cadillac CTS, I did not like the angular exterior design.Also I was not impressed with the Acura TL-S, for the money I would rather get the Lincoln MKX at $35K you can fill it nicely with options, and the salesman was willing to deal from that MSRP ie. bargain for a 6 year extended warantee etc. "
"kdshapiro","November 2006"," I don't know about you, but I don't want a volvo. I'm planning for my 335. Mazda is cheap to me, I won't put myself in one. RX-8 is a one trick pony. "

"circlew","November 2006"," I owned a Lincoln LS and it was a great car but when I test drove the 330xi, I was blown away by the driving performance. You need to drive one to know in your heart. Here is a good article on the progression at Lincoln to the new MKZ...Since the death of the good handling but weak selling LS sedan model, the brand has concentrated on cushy riding semi-luxury barges like the geriatric Town Car and last year's much more modern but still floaty Zephyr mid-sized sedan. As such, demanding roads like those in the Tennessee valleys were not on the agenda.Things have changed, however in the last 12 months. After being helmed virtually into the ground by series of ill-suited executives, Lincoln is under new management and most importantly has been given a much needed dose of fresh or revised products.The Zephyr has morphed into the MKZ, the Navigator underwent a major refreshening and most significantly, the MKX -- an upscale version of the Ford Edge crossover -- has joined the ranks. The Town Car still lurks in the background but it survives only to serve out an audience that is headed into extinction.Recognizing that the Zephyr was shy on horsepower and a little sloppy at the controls, the engineering team upped the V-6 powertrain to 263 hp (from 221), kept the six-speed automatic transmission, offered all wheel drive as an option and firmed up the ride and handling. Even without these improvements, the Zephyr has sold surprisingly well for Lincoln, so the brand rightly expects even better results from the MKZ. And while the car will never be compared with a BMW Three Series or an Acura TL in the handling department, it is certainly a match for the likes of the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima. And it is sufficiently competent to cope with the Tennessee twisters, including the infamous Deals Gap section, a road with 318 turns in just 11 miles.Regards,OW "
"ggesq","November 2006"," ""Just no ""luxury"" - otherwise it'd be a ringer in this comparison.""Exactly- that's why it doesn't belong in the comparison.IMHO, the RX-8 with its ""4 doors"" (and I use the term loosely) does not qualify it being a sedan. "

"fedlawman","November 2006"," They are ""overpriced"" because they don't benefit from ""parts-bin"" engineering like the domestics. The Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, Lincoln Zephyr, and MKZ are all worked over Mazda 6's.The Mazda 6 is a fine, sporty family sedan, but it's no luxury car. The difference between the 6/MKZ/Fusion and BMW 3-series is obvious the moment you climb in and close the door. The BMW has such a rigid structure that you can hear and feel it when you shut the door. The materials may not be ""plush"" by Buick standards, but the quality is a notch or two above the domestics - just touch the plastics or actuate a control stalk/button to feel the difference. Drive a BMW over rough pavement or expansion joints, and the rock solid structure screams quality and engineering prowess - not just suspension tuning. Finally (and most importantly), wind the engine past redline, brake late entering your favorite corner, trail brake while you heel & toe downshift, and then add gentle throttle to settle the car. Now feel for that little seam in the pavement through your hands, feet, and seat (you know the one) that tells you it's time to set up for the apex. Get on the gas smoothly, shifting weight to the rear wheels and tighten your line mid-corner. Nail the apex and smoothly unwind the wheel while adding throttle. Do this repeatedly and you'll understand why a BMW costs as much as it does (and why it's worth every penny).It's all about giving the driver precise control and feedback, possessing neutral, razor-sharp yet forgiving handling characteristics, and amazingly, still maintaining a compliant ride that's comfortable for everyday driving - all with 4 doors and a back seat. Nobody does this better than BMW. "

"flash11","November 2006"," Good point, stick vs. automatic does make a difference to some people. Engineering a manual shift into the Lincoln MKZ would be too much to ask from Ford right now I think but I will bring it up with my Ford buddies maybe the word will trickle to the right people  That said, I found the MKZ a better buy overall, stick be dammed, than the BMW or MB I tried. I will try the 335i or a used E class within the next year before I make a decision. The MKZ sure was sporty at 263hp, really liked the power, the ride, and the interior/exterior design is perfect including the solidity at high speed. I will admit it is beefier and probably would not beat your BMW or MB in a race off down hair pin turn roads. Its just that its got this look, especially in dark colors with those chrome rims-very beautiful. Talked to a MB sales person today and she said its normal to feel that way, some of the North American products are actually good, but the major factor she said was how I would feel about it in 5 years, and upon resale or trade in, the loss in value is substantial. So if you want a BMW, MB, or Jaguar XK (Beautiful 007 look alike car by the way), you will have to pay the price. Myself, I guess I will suffer with a MKZ unless otherwise proven wrong. I firmly believe you are making a mistake not considering it comparible to BMW and MB. Strip the Beemer and MB badges and compare car to car, the Lincoln MKZ is definately comparible. Sorry you don't share my enthusiasm, you give too much credit to BMW and MB IMHO. Not having a manual stick option does not bother me in the least, but my MKZ will have the Nav.system,beefed up stereo,sunroof, chrome rims, the luxury group and hp to boot for the same price $35K vrrrum vrrumm ! I will have to deal with the resale issue after I have had years of driving pleasure with it  "
"kdshapiro","November 2006"," Everybody has their priorities in what they look for in a vehicle. The reason people give instant credit to BMW is due to the reputation they have earned. Frankly overpriced is a value judgement.With my $10/mo VZ Nav couldn't care about navigation and I like a basic stereo with CD. I can use the VZ Nav when not in my car. What's important to you is not at all important to me.There are all sorts of choice out there for consumers. BMW and Infiniti have built a reputation and you know what their vehicles will do.

The e9x car is pulling sub 5 second 0-60 times and slalom speeds on par with an M3. We're talking about a track ready car that marries sublime performance to everyday civility.

"rockylee","November 2006"," Well that depends alot on how long he decides to keep it. If he's going to drive a car for a couple of years perhaps you are right.

Is the MKZ going to depreciate $10-$15K faster over the # of years he owns the car ?($29-$38K MKZ vs. $38-$50K+ 335i) Since we don't know the actual market-value of the MKZ or 335i we won't know the truth for a couple of years. We can only assume he's better off owning the 335i in a average lease cycle with the same amount of mileage allowed per yr.

"kdshapiro","November 2006"," The reason you got ""slammed"" is because you're posting like the buying public is stupid and more specifically we are stupid. Comparing an A8 with an Azera, who are you kidding? In your mind the S80 represents the best thing going. If that were a fact, Volvo would be ruling the world instead of being owned by Ford. The Volvo has it's place, but I think the entire model line is ugly and unbalanced and drives the same way. The S80 has nothing in comparison to the LS, A8 or 7 series. It is not better looking, better handling or has a better interior. It is cheaper in eveyway possible than the luxury class cars you mentioned.In addition, the 335 will also dust every car in this segment in performance, you cannot do enough after-market upgrades to non-turbo models to make it as fast as a turbo. A little chip in the 335 will make it even faster. You get what you pay for.If price is your main concern you should not be looking at luxury automobiles as a comparison, because the S80 falls short compared to them in everything. Maybe you should head on over the high end luxury marquees forum and post an A8 is the equivalent of an Azera. See how you can convince these folks that own the automobiles.

The Q is more worthy than the M in a comparo. The GS, is more sport than luxury in my eyes. What race? A drag race?

Your answer will indicate how much you know about the upper end auto market.My instinct is the Lexus LS, will certainly get cross shopped by a unbiased consumer with the S80. Audi A8, I'd guess 30-40% because both are AWD. The 7er would be 5-10% S-class 20-25% if the consumer wanted AWD.Rocky "

"louiswei","November 2006"," I've driven the 330i, G35, IS350/250, TL, S60, Saab 9-3. Trust me, the Volvo and Saab is no where near the Bimmer in handling. They can't out-turn and bimmer, can't out-run the Lexus and Infiniti and can't out-gadget the TL. That's why I stated that they DON'T belong.However, don't get me wrong here. When I say that the S80 doesn't belong in the same category as the A8 and LS I mean it doesn't belong because of the luxury factor. Can it out-run the A8 and LS? Maybe, but definitely not in straight line performance. "

At the same time, go sit in a IS350 and tell us that they are in the same level ""luxury-wise"" as the baby Lex.As to your first point, performance is an objective measure, so I have to agree that the 335 trumps all. Luxury, on the other hand, has a large degree of subjectivity, so I can't agree with you there.Now, back to the 335, if I was spending $40k and could live with its size, then great. The 335 seems like a GREAT car, and I'd love to get one. However, if I wanted to spend less, wanted AWD, and an adjustable suspension, with incredibly comfortable seats, I'd pick the S60R. So I'm still not sure why so many folks here are adverse to this car. As I asked another poster who never replied ... have you driven an S60R? I'm not saying its the best here. I'm not saying you should pick it over the precious bmw. All I'm saying is that it has its own merits and certainly deserves to sit in the forum alongside the others in this category. "

You reach for something - it's right where it should be. I'm convinced Ford bought Volvo mostly for its interior and ergomics designers. The layout is understated Scandinavian design at its best - it's there, but it's as intruseive as the Avalon is(very good interior, btw - someone's been copying Volvo and Mercedes there - heh)The sound system is astounding - forget aftermarket. And of course, the gearing is typical Volvo - all about performance and quickness and not about economy(thogh it does get 20/28). You hit maximum power exactly when you think you should and it's a joy in daily driving. Manual, of course. Automatic is a whole other thing, verging on a disaster. Given that 80-90% of cars in Europe are manuals, and the automatic is an afterthought design-wise for rental fleets of tourists from America, it's understandable why there's such a drastic difference between the two. BMW's simmilar in this respect - they really don't design the cars to work well with automatics either. "
"blueguydotcom","November 2006"," Add the premium package just to get a freaking moonroof so the price is up around 34k. Not a bad deal.But the massive discount off MSRP is scary. Why are they giving the car away?Also, for 300 hp, the car is pretty darn slow. "
"plekto","November 2006"," 5.7 seconds isn't ""slow"". A decade ago, Porsches were doing barely any better, and last I checked, it's alot better than the domestics.Really - it used to be ""It's crap if it's not 6 seconds"" now it's 5 seconds? Last I checked humans haven't evolved in the last 10-20 years. 5.7 seconds... Most people would consider it as ""really fast"". Oh - and it's not a test-track only result. I've driven it and it'll go just as fast at about any speed thanks to its agressive gearbox. It's fast off the line and in the twisties as well. Your Camry isn't even in the rear view mirror anymore after a couple of miles. And AWD is a nice plus in bad weather. Oh - it's REAL AWD, btw - simmilar to Subaru and Audi. Full-time and not part-time. Makes a huge impact in how it handles, which is why it's an A6 competitor. For handling, it's ""sporty"" and then some. The 4-piston disc brakes back this up. GM - still using 1 or 2 piston calipers for comparison.P.S. Who cares about the discount?

"louiswei","November 2006"," Here are my opinions...1. I wouldn't touch the Saab because you are pretty much buying a GM car. However, if you like GM then that's another story.2. If you are going with the A4, my suggestion is that get the 3.0 instead of 2.0T. The 4 cylinder turbo is way underpower in my point of view.3. If there are no major changes between the 07' and 06' I don't see why not to take the advantage of the year end deal.4. I personally would purchase instead of lease. Don't ask me why but that's just me. "
"mz6greyghost","November 2006"," I'd usually avoid a lease as well, but in this case, I'd consider it, especially if you can stay within the mileage limits.Why? Because it's an Audi, a nameplate that's been near the bottom of quality surveys for a few years now. They've been almost legendary in their terrible reliability, so much that I personally wouldn't risk buying one outright. Who knows? You may have better luck...The Saab? Not much better reliability-wise, but a friend of the family is driving his third Saab, and has had NO problems with any of them (he still has two of them and the third went to his son in college).

I'll give my opinion, remember, just my opinion, it's your money.Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi,Audi. The Saab.. you'll probably be able to negotiate the best deal on this guy as far as over all price. Wait, are you leasing, or buying outright? I think for everyday driving, it's really hard to beat Audi. BMW does some things better, especially if you want to occasionally track the car. Have you driven them all? Most of us are going to chose the one that feels the best behind the wheel.Ok. I see that you have some buying and leasing options. You then have to ask yourself, do I want to be in a car until it's paid off. There is something to be said for turning the car in at the end of 3 years or so and getting something else. Most ""financial minded"" people will tell you to buy slightly used, and drive till dead.  My guess is that you'll find the Saab a little ""loose"" compared to the Audi. Check out the ""10 steps to leasing a car"" here on Edmunds. Unless you are already familiar about the financial aspects of both that is. Good luck, and don't be a stranger after you get the car.

This fuel-sipping diesel will be even faster, so the perfect reviews are almost writing themselves already.The diesel&#146;s only downfall is the automatic box, as the near perfect six-speed manual in the 335 simply can&#146;t take the torque, and this is by far most enticing option for serious drivers. It&#146;s a good semi-automatic, but if you&#146;re going that way then wait for the oil-burner that could single-handedly rewrite the rules on diesel motoring.The BMW 3 Series might be the icon of corporate avarice, but the reassuringly expensive 335i Coupe also happens to be one of the best everyday cars in the world.""Does anyone have further details?Regards,OW "

"qbrozen","November 2006"," that's tough ... but my answer would be the same for both, regardless of what that answer is. Why should size matter? The CTS is the smallest Caddy available, therefore its their entry-level car. If we wanted to get real strict, then we'd exclude the S60 we've been talking about because the S40 is slotted beneath it. Likewise, the TL is excluded because the TSX exists. So where is the line?Is it size? Is it price? Is it where it falls in the manufacturers lineup?There are more cars here besides the 335i, folks. Not everything needs to be measured against that car. Some folks don't want to spend $40k on a car that size. End of story. If I were to decide this talk includes the entry-level car from each luxo manufacturer, then, yes, the CTS is included. However, this also means the TL and S60 are excluded. If we decide all engine options for each car are included, then, yes, the 335i is allowed, as well as the CTS-V. HOWEVER, if we decide on a price cap, that could be a whole different story. It would include multiple entries from the same manufacturer, while excluding some from others. It kind of sounds like that's what some folks are shooting for here. "

"louiswei","November 2006"," why one midsize example is allowed in (the TL), but others are not (5-series, E-class, etc).I don't think Acura designed the TL to compete against the 5er and E-class. TL's main targets are 3er, IS and G and that's why even though it has the size advantage it is still considered as a entry lux performance sedan.Acura uses the 2-entry-model-sedan lineup with the TSX and TL just like the ES/IS combo for Lexus. However, that doesn't mean that TSX is the entry lux and TL is the midsize lux. It's just the strategy Acura decided to pursuit. "
"louiswei","November 2006"," Ditto the TL. It's not all about size in this class. Some are bigger and some are smaller but ultimately the market will decide which class does it fall.

"blueguydotcom","November 2006"," I think it boils down to this....You guys are anti-gm and just because GM, makes a faster better performing car than BMW's 335i, y'all will say it doesn't compete. .At a starting price of over 52k, the CTS-V no more competes against the 38k 335i than the M3 competes against the MKZ.Different classes of cars.

"louiswei","November 2006"," Well, that's why you don't see TSX on top of the board...Personally I think TSX is an awesome car and if I was $10K short on the budget when I was shopping for a car TSX would be my #1 choice. However, the lack of power just make it not competitive enough to be included in this category.As for the $39K 335i...It doesn't matter how many of them are going to be made the bottom line is that if one wants a stripped down based 335i (still comes with 300hp, 300 lb-ft twin turbo inline 6), he/she can have it. On the other hand, Rocky, can you find me a CTS-V for $40K? I really don't want the leather seat, sun roof, upgraded radio, navigation and I'll take the 17"" wheel. Can you get me a stripped down CTS-V? "

Go try a MKZ, compare it. I test drove it again today, the car is absolutely luxurious, with speed and style. That 263hp engine gives a lot of power and acceleration. It beats out the BMW and MB hands down when considering Luxury,Performance,options,price equally. It may not have a stick yet, may never will, but should not be excluded here based on that. There was no rule set about the stick just someones opinion, and this car should get mentioned here. I strongly believe the list in this forum should include the MKZ, along side any BMW 328xi, MB C230, Caddie CTS and Volvo S60R. You are doing your readers an injustice by keeping other manufacturers reputations hyped while Ford has outdone itself and deserves a place here.

I did ED in 2006 with my 330i and unless something blows me away by december of 2007, I'll probably order a 335i for pickup in January/February of 08. The GTI and Mazdaspeed3 still call to my frugal side but my indulgent side (and girlfriend) encourage me to follow the fun. Anyway, my last ED trip involved flying to Munich and then driving through Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France. I probably spent over $2500 total over 2 weeks. So did I really save much on my car? I look at it this way, I got a fantastic experience, a great vaction and a new car all rolled into one. I was going to take a vacation anyway...I happened to pick up a car while on it. In 2008, our flight will be free - frequent flyer miles - and we may spend only a week in Europe this time but we're still going to have some fun while picking up a new car. Plus the thrill of driving your car on the autobahn at 140+ mph is not to be missed. Wow. I realize not everyone wants to do this.

If the 350Z had a back seat and four doors... There are a few oddballs out there that might fit in like this, so don't count everything out. I think $35K is a good limit. $40K+ after delivery and taxes and such is really mainstream luxury territory. $35K also gives you enough room to add a few options and so on and end up out the door for under $40K.IMO, the MKZ fits the category.

"fedlawman","November 2006"," In my opinion, the reason why the MKZ doesn't belong in this segment is because of it's DNA.The BMW 3-series was designed from the ground up to be a premium, benchmark setting entry-level luxury performance car. Every facet of its design, from engine, suspension, chassis, materials, etc. was conceived for the purpose of making the 3-series the most satisfying car to drive and own in this segment.The MKZ, on the other hand, is a ""parts-bin creation"" conceived by Ford marketing to turn a 5 year-old, $18,000 Mazda6 into a $34,000 ""premium sedan.""Don't get me wrong, I think the Mazda6 is a perfectly competent sedan - a reasonable alternative to the Accord and Camry.

"fedlawman","November 2006"," You know Pat, after I posted my last message last night, I started thinking that we might be wrong after all.I actually lost some sleep last night thinking about how I might have dismissed the ""car that must not be named"" a little prematurely. Humor me before you delete this.We (I) dismissed the MKZ as a non-performance car from a non-luxury marque, and that was that. Last night, I wrote that the MKZ is not worthy because it's based largely on the Mazda6, which is more or less a pedestrian midsize car.Here's what got me rethinking this - consider the Acura TL. You could argue that the TL is squarly in this segment - FWD yes, but peformance oriented, luxurious, high quality, and from an agreed upon luxury marque.But consider how much the TL and MKZ have in common. Both are FWD and both share 95% of their DNA with a 5-year old midsize car design (and the Mazda6 and Accord are direct competitors in price, performance, and features). Both marques actually exist in their own little ""tweener"" band of near-luxury, not actually luxury like M-B, Jaguar, and BMW.Compare both cars side-by-side, feature for feature, and the MKZ and TL have a lot in common (HP, wheelbase, weight, features, price, etc.).My conclusion? If the MKZ doesn't belong here, it's only because of Lincoln's heritage as a plush car maker compared to Acura's race heritage. Acura's literature contains detailed specs about the TL's performance features (roll bar diameter, turns lock-to-lock, size and type of brakes, dampeners, etc. while Lincoln literature lacks any specifics. Other than that, the two are pretty close on paper.One final point - I think perhaps that the base TL no longer belongs here for the same reasons that the MKZ doesn't. Years have marched on and we now have the TL-S - the base TL (which always was a little soft and floaty for my taste) now lacks a manual tranny option. All of the ""go-fast"" parts like thicker sway bars, 6-speed MT, etc. are all on the TL-S. The base TL is arguably more like a Buick than ever before.I'm sure many won't agree, but I feel guilty that I've wronged a competent car, and I want to make things right. After a lot more research on my part, the MKZ still isn't my kind of car, but I think it's more car than any of us have given it credit for. "

Yes, it has RWD and 300+hp but I don't think the IS 350 should be excluded much less the base TL. Although FWD, the base TL still has front and rear suspension characteristics of a sport sedan, rack and pinion steering, and a rigid body structure.The TL also has the ""steptronic"" transmission. A feature not found on the Lincoln. Personally, I think the steptronic transmission is a joke because it doesn't let you hold a gear for as long as you want- the computer kicks in. Nonetheless it is still there and it is combined with the drive by wire throttle system. All of the aforementioned combined make the base TL a ""sporty"" FWD sedan.Rumors about the 4G TL is that it will have 300hp+ and AWD. "

"habitat1","November 2006"," ""Right now, the closer you get to 40,000 the closer you get to the ES 330, not too mention the remarkedly improved IS.

At 38,000 it ma be too close to the Lexus"".I can't speak to ""most people"", but for me and many I know, Acura and Lexus are not as directly competitive as your post suggests, and as such there is no intrinsic need for Acura to be less expensive than Lexus. If my 2004 TL 6-speed were to be crushed by a falling tree tonight, there is still nothing in the entire 2007 Lexus line-up that would get me to stop in their showroom. The closest would probably be the IS350, but its dimunitive back seat and lack of a manual transmission are non-starters. Lexus could sell the ES350 for $20k and, in spite of that being an extraordinary deal, I wouldn't buy it. In 2001, I bought a Honda S2000, in 2005 a Porsche 911S. There is no price that would have gotten me to give the Lexus SC430 a serious look. As ggesg indicated, Lexus is more luxury oriented, Acura is more sport oriented. The closest we ever came to buying a Lexus was when we were SUV shopping last year. We seriously considered the GX, but ended up in a MDX due to the better 7 passenger functionality and the better on-road handling driving dynamics. The GX would have been less expensive, considering it qualified for a tax writeoff, but once again, didn't quite meet our needs and preferences. I know of some who have cross shopoped the GS and RL, but in that category, I'd be in a 530i or 550i (6-speed stick of course).  "

Doing even more research and giving the topic of the MKZ further thought, I realized that, although it has a lot in common with the TL (humble DNA, upscale features, etc.), the Lexus ES350 also falls into the same category.Reading the Lexus literature and reviewing the ES350 here at Edmonds, Lexus actually advertisess the size of the brakes, presence of front & rear sway bars, and the fully-independant suspension on the ES350.We all agree that the ES is not a performance car to be considered in this forum - but the TL is. The MKZ has the potential to be a TL rival at the test track given the sporting nature of the Mazda6 (especially when compared to the Accord), but until we drive the Lincoln, we just don't know.The enthusiast in me is guessing the MKZ is probably a wanna be ES350, but who knows - the Lincoln LS surprised everyone when it came out...

Most of us enthusiasts here dismissed the MKZ without the benefit of seeing it in person, let alone driving it. We are quick to toss it aside because as enthusiasts, we are averse to it's appearance, brand identity, and pedestrian underpinnings.I have already made my point about how similar in concept and DNA the MKZ is to the TL - and I think my argument is sound.So, here's another observation - the majority of us also dislike the interior and/or exterior styling of the Cadillac CTS. Even with this consensus, we all pretty much agree that the CTS is an ""entry-level luxury performance sedan"" and a member of this segment - even if it's not our favorite member.So let's put aside our prejudice and reserve judgement until we see how the MKZ performs.

The 350 is mainstream luxury - and belong in the next segment up. The older IS300 Sportcross *did* belong here, though - quick and fun.- The C-class is out as well. Too ""190"" series. Plastic and fake lux and handles like a slightly improved Civic. Mercedes seems to have abandoned this segment lately.- The Volvo S40 is a joke - toss out as well. The S60, though, definately belongs like the CTS - it may not be a BMW, but it still makes the cut.We should also add in specific models that are not quite sedans as well, if, like the IS300 Sportcross, it's the only manual equipped version of the vehicle. For instance, a small 4 door crossover *might* apply(though I've never seen one that handles like a car instead of a truck) or something that's a 4 door hatchback like the older Saabs used to be.

Some collector wanted it for a decent enough price, so at least it will get restored properly/live on.But I'm now needing an entry-level sport sedan/coupe in the 5-8 year old range. I have the money, but I really only want to spend $12-15K.Top of the list so far(all manual):- Older IS300 with.- Wide range of Mercedes. AMG and so on. Problem is that 8-10 years old is worrying me. I did see a couple of S500 coupes for under $20K, though...(grin) The C230K sedan also is attractive. Same as the C230K coupe, but a sedan.- Used CTS 3.6/stickshift- Celica GT-S(okay, kind of different, but sweet car anyways - only fwd car I really loved to drive)- Used RX-8.- Used BMW - no idea what models are reliable/good used.- Volvo S60/S70/C70 - T5 or R- Saab 9-5The criteria in general is stickshift(non negotiable), RWD(Celica and Saab is about it, otherwise non negotiable) and a good engine. Supercharged 4, V6, etc. Inline 6 preferred, of course. Perhaps this is a new thread, but it sort of fits and well, creating a new one just adds clutter.So.. same topic, used... what's the best deal out there? "
"robbieg","December 2006"," I am not the used car expert but I highly doubt you can get a CTS with the 3.6 and a stick shift for 15k,not to mention that one would be hard to find. With regard to the Mercedes. The S500 coupes are not stick shift. You probably would have to look at the C230 to find a stick and I bet one would be hard to find because I doubt that many where sold with a stick. A c230 coupe with a stick would be easier to find but that is a coupe. Also, I haven't priced RX-8s but I would guess that they are above 15k. The IS300 came in a stick starting in 2002 and one of these may slide into your price range. Saabs are definitely in your price range but do you really want a used Saab? With regard to Volvo, an R is clearly out of your price range. You may find a T-5, but, like the Saab, reliability may be an issue. I am not a BMW expert, so I will let someone else answer that one and let you know how old you will have to go to get below 15k. Also, if luxury isn't necessarily you thing, you may want to try a WRX. "
"shipo","December 2006"," Depending upon mileage and features, I've seen 2000 528i sedans for well under $15,000.

"plekto","December 2006"," Well, this I know.  A 2004 RX-8 is closer to $12K if you shop around, but first year cars are problematic. $15K can be had with some haggling on a 2005, though. Los Angeles is great that way - most everything sells for low trade-in(but dealers give you auction for trade-in as a result)I searched nationwide on three databases and found *one* S500 Coupe from the mid 90s with a manual transmission - evidently brought over from Europe or something and converted to U.S. specs. Just got me thinking is all. The maintainence is going to be rough on any large Mercedes, especially 9 years old. I even found a local dealer who was ""willing"" to let me have a 2001 ML320 for $9K(?) due to the horrid reliability. I passed, of course. I even looked at a couple of older 928s, but they are very very pricey to maintain. And 10-12 years old is more than pushing it for electrical and emissions equipment.The T5 and R Volvos are only about 1-2K apart in value and they've been making them since oh, 1998 or so. I've had a sporty Volvo in the past and it was fun, but FWD and 200+HP isn't my piece of cake, either, given how Volvos have noticeable torque-steer when the turbo kicks in. Finding a S80 from Europe/Canada with stickshift is unobtainium as well. Maybe one every six months shows up for sale in the U.S.(only a couple of hundred over a decade were brought over this way via the European delivery program)The CTS... yeah - $17K was the lowest I could haggle on one last week, but I just... I've been burnt by GM ""quality"" so many times... My last pre-Ford/still Swedish designed and built Volvo was bulletproof by comparison. Shoot, my dad just spent $750 on his old Buick for electrical. Now, it's been very reliable up until now, but the electrical/sensors on the engine are starting to go at only 8 years old. 3 coil packs, a new MAF, and a couple of other minor things.The WRX is out. Sat in one and it was just nasty. Very much love/hate ergonomics in it. The Forester was fine, though. I just worry about reliability is all.(though my cousin's new WRX seems to be perfectly fine - and fast as stink)BMW - my knowledge ends at about 1995.Now if only something like the Celica existed with RWD, four doors, and had a back seat big enough to fit my 8yr old son. I'd SO love a 350Z if it had a back seat. Looks like it could easily fit one, but the geniuses at Nissan decided to fill the rear in with empty space/a shelf the size of a couple of huge subwoofers instead.So far the C230/C320 is edging towards the top due to their poor resale value. :P $12995 asking price at about 5 local dealers for a 2003 coupe. The 230 sedan or 320 coupe is $15K - and that's before haggling.EDIT:Concerning the BMW 5 series:2000 528i $11,376 $12,975 $14,702Like the price, but how reliable are they?

Should I get the V8 model instead(though it seems awfully heavy at 3600+ lbs)""The 2000 E39 is considered to be very reliable with but a few problem areas (ball joints, radiator and water pump) and even those have since been mitigated with replacement parts.Given that my normal 12,000-15,000 mile commute year (a measure that had been very stable until June of 2005) has been upset (I've driven over 50,000 miles since that point) I'm looking for a 2000 528i 5-Speed with both the Premium Package, Sport Package and ""M"" interior (sport seats and steering wheel). Cars so equipped typically bottom out at about $14,000 and are very few and far between.  The good news is that assuming proper maintenance by the original owner(s), these cars should be good for an easy quarter of a million miles without any significant maintenance dollars.If/when I find one, the first things I'll be doing to mine will be to go through the front suspension, replace the water pump with a new all-metal one, replace the plastic tanked radiator with an all metal one (assuming this hasn't been done already), flush the cooling and brake systems, fit a set of low dust/dustless brake pads and new rotors, and any other cosmetic items that I find wanting.Once gone through I figure I can get an easy 150,000 to 200,000 miles with only minimal (meaning scheduled) maintenance and few if any significant repairs.Regarding the V8, fun though they may be, there is one key element that I'm having a tough time getting over. Even though both the I6 and the V8 engines are have aluminum blocks, the I6 sports steel sleeved cylinder bores while the V8 sports silicone impregnated cylinder bores. While I have no real proof of this, I suspect that the I6 mill will last longer.Another thing to consider when comparing I6 to V8 engined 5-Series cars is the steering system. On the E34 and E39 models, there wasn't enough room to fit a Rack and Pinion system to the V8 models and as such they have a more conventional Recirculating Ball system. I much prefer the nimbleness of the I6 models due to their lighter weight and their Rack and Pinion steering.Best Regards,Shipo "

That is M3 territory.You can't have it both ways. The S60 is not an M3 at Accord prices. Performance numbers of the 335i beat every performance number of the S60R. Even if they are tied in some areas, the 335i still wins according to the EPA.Maybe to clarify you would like to post the best performance numbers you saw for the S60R and the best performance numbers you saw for the 335i. Don't forget to include links.By conveniently not posting any performance numbers for both of them, you get to say what you want without it really being the truth.Here is some information I found in 2 seconds. Note Edmunds does not think this is in the same league as the M3. http://www.edmunds.com/new/research/volvo/s60r.htmlOnce behind the wheel of the Volvo S60 R, low-end torque is prodigious and acceleration remains strong almost all the way to its 6,800-rpm redline. It is not quite in the same league as Audi's S4, BMW's M3 and Mercedes' C55 AMG, but it's closer than we ever thought Volvo car would get. And thanks to the continuously variable valve timing, efficient turbocharger and twin intercoolers, throttle response is excellent with minimal turbo lag. Volvo claims a 5.4-second 0-to-60-mph time for the S60 R. For higher-level handling, Volvo has fitted the R cars with its Four-C (Continuously Controlled Chassis Concept) system, which combines an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system with a semiactive, continuously adjustable suspension system.http://www.modernracer.com/volvos60r.htmlTop speed : 148 mph(electronically limited)0-60 mph : 5.4 sec.(manual), 6.0 sec.(auto)0-? mile : 14.0 sec @ 101.0 mph60-0 braking distance : 118 ft200 ft skidpad : 0.88 ghttp://www.autoblog.com/2006/09/26/the-beast-within-bmw-335i-sedan-hits-sixty-in- - - - -4-8-seconds/They managed a 4.8 to be exact on their way to a quarter in 13.5 seconds at 106 mph.

"esf","December 2006"," The new 335i coupe is simply the most beautiful 3 Series ever put in production. When it drives by, I feel like pulling over and admiring it as it drives by, as a sign of respect. Of course, I don't- but I'm aching for a 335xi coupe as my next winter car, if it ever comes out.Now, I have a dilemma. Right now, I have an A3 as my winter car, but my son will be taking that in little more than a year and a half. The A3 is great as a commuter, and I know he'll appreciate it- but I want something more upscale for my next winter car. I'm going to end up with a BMW (90% sure). But, which one?My wife has an SUV now (RX330), but we're custom-ordering an Audi A8 4.2 quattro for her next month, and her RX will be gone by the end of March. So, we'll be an SUV-free family. What makes most sense in my situation?3 Series coupe would be my choice based on style. It's more of a ""me"" car, and less something that I would shuttle family around in. I've also never owned a 3 Series, and I know it would be a rewarding experience.The new X5 is very handsome, inside and out. Perhaps I'd get a smaller SUV (X3, Q5, GLK) if I was looking at one, but the X5 is tempting with its wealth of options and fantastic engine choices. It also may make sense to get this over a smaller SUV- I hate the X3, wouldn't want a FOURTH Audi in the family, and just can't see myself in a Mercedes. I have a feeling the new 535xi sedan that's coming out could be the best compromise of both. It has fun-to-drive-ness that almost matches the 3 Series, and better practicality (keep in mind that I would not get a 3 Series sedan). However, a glaring flaw is the interior. IMO it's the worst of all the BMWs and has cheap plastics- I drove a 530xi for my wife before deciding on the A8 and wasn't impressed (7 Series doesn't come with AWD). So, I don't really want to compromise. What makes more sense? 335xi or X5, in my situation?Thanks.'06 Audi A3 2.0T DSG &#149;?'05 Audi S4 Cabriolet &#149;?'04 Lexus RX330 "

"nyccarguy","December 2006"," Well, if you REALLY don't want to compromise then why do you think you need an AWD BMW? Where do you live? Go for a 335i Coupe (RWD) with a sports package & 6-speed manual transmission. Get a set of 4 dedicated winter tires/wheels for the few months of winter.An awd BMW will be heavier which will adversely affect braking & handling in wet, snowy, & dry conditions. Your fuel economy will also suffer in an AWD car vs. its RWD counterpart. The AWD BMW will also cost you more $ upfront.You're worried about traction in snowy & icy conditions? An AWD car with 4 dedicated winter tires will accelerate better from a complete stop than the same RWD car with 4 dedicated winter tires. AWD may help you get going, but that extra 242 pounds (2007 BMW 328i vs. 328xi sedan from bmw na's website) could be the split second you need to stop from hitting a deer or swerve to avoid an accident. Many people equate AWD with safety and therefore DO NOT put a set of dedicated winter tires on their AWD equipped cars.

No. What is the only thing on your car that touches the ground? TIRES! "

Winter time driving around here is far more challenging than it ever was in Chicago what with the roads around here being VERY hilly and curvy. On my street alone (a half mile long cul-de-sac) there are two hills that are officially 7.5% grades and my driveway is more like 9%. That said, you couldn't pay me to buy an AWD car when a RWD variant of the same vehicle is available. For my money I much rather prefer buying a car with a very good suspension and three season tires (well, that's a stretch as I run winter tires around here from October or November through March or April, even May one year) and then buying a separate set of winter wheels and tires. On my RWD 530i, the winter tires provided more than enough grip to propel my car through snow that was deep enough to turn my car into a snow plow, even with the hills.Best Regards,Shipo "
"habitat1","December 2006"," ""but is it okay for a daily driver?""Better than I expected. I've logged 11,600 miles in 15 months compared to only 2,800 in my 2004 Acura TL. When I had the S2000, my split between it and a 1995 Maxima was more like 50/50. The only time I don't drive my 911 is when I need to cart 2+ adult passengers or I head north in the winter.

The $10k difference between the base and ""S"" gets you about $4,500 worth of options on your list (xenon, 19"" PASM) not to mention bigger brakes, etc. But you are right, Porsche option pricing can be a little ridiculous. Regarding that ""0.2 second difference"", it is understated by Porsche. Motor Trend tested the 911S Coupe at 0-60 in 3.9 seconds. That's not far off from the former 996 Turbo.""The XKR is also a much better value- beautiful to look at, and has an extra 95hp (compared to the Carrera)"" Don't get me wrong, the XKR is a nice car. But that ""extra 95 horsepower"" doesn't come close to equating to the same performance. The 911S is as quick as and handles much better than a 500 hp BMW M6, let alone the XKR. And at least the M6 comes with a 6-speed manual. I find it difficult to have much fun with a slushbox, even around town.Sounds like you'll need to set some time aside for serious test drives before you buy.

When I first looked at the CTS at the New England Auto Show when it was first released years ago, I didn't initially look at the Monroney. First strike was the exterior (imho a basically handome design then ruined by extra layers, shapes and a truckish front end). Strike two was the interior: cheap, cheap, cheap and incongruous. But, maybe the drive would be great (post auto-show). So, now to the sticker: Steeeeerkike three!!! $40k+. Crossed off the list, and on I went. But hey. It was a departure, and overall a good enough drive to be a winner for Caddy. But just think had they built the complete car and priced it a la Lexus back in '89...I'm partial to the XLR. Unfortunately, wicked over-priced. Hence production was cut in half during its first year of production (if I remember correctly). Ths STS, yeah you know. Rebates, trunk money etc, etc. I think the rebates/trunk money and general typical GM fire sales diminish the brand.

Once the starting price of the bigger engine version (3.6L) is approaching $37K (335i territory) then it's all over.What I would like to see is...Small engine version (2.8L maybe?): Starting at $29K just to make a point that it's below $30K.Big engine version (3.6L): Starting at $34K to undercut the IS350 and be competitive with the G35.Standard equipments: Xenon + turning headlight, moonroof, push-button start, easy access, bluetooth, manual tranny, 18-inch wheels, DVD audio system.I truly believe that if the above criteria can be reached then Caddy is going to have a winner in their inventory.

"allargon","December 2006"," If you don't like the exterior of the CTS, then the new redesign probably won't do much for you. I declined to buy an Acura TL recently despite loving the size, driving dynamics (complaints about the FWD and turning circle are IMHO overblown) and interior of the car because every time I looked at it in my garage I would think I can't believe I bought an Accord! :sick: (Yes, I know the suspension, engine, gadgets, make it so much more. But, it looks like an Accord despite the body kit.)I love the in your face exterior of the CTS. A lot of people don't like American styling. (They can buy the Mazda6 instead of the Ford Fusion or the Toyota Matrix instead of the Pontiac Vibe.) However, a lot of people don't like the exteriors of Japanese cars, either. The only reason there's no CTS in my garage now is due to the interior. I can handle the angular padding on the doors and dash and the cheap plastic (the G35 has plenty, too), but that center stack instrument panel just hurts my eyes too much.Pricing? Cadillacs were never cheap cars. IMHO, they shouldn't be. Part of the decline of their status of a brand in addition to the quality decline is the fact that there are so many cheaper, older ones on the road. In Europe, there are plenty of older Audis on the road (""Pimp My Ride"" and ""Top Gear"" showcase them all the time.), but I almost never see older Audis in the US.Residuals? The CTS actually held its value pretty well considering it was an American car. (The STS? Ouch, 35K worth of depreciation in two years.) It actually did well in this class. The Japanese 3 (Acura, Infiniti, Lexus) in this class hold their values better than the European ones.100mph in the 1/4 mile? Yeah, a lot of folks mentioned the rally cars. 50k? How about adding the CTS-V, Chrysler 300C ST8 and the Boxster S (base) as contenders. (Note: I was too lazy to actually look up the #'s to see if they belong.) "

I test drove the G35 coupe but I decided on a sedan and the G sedan is not my taste either, although the '07 looks far better. The coupe handled great and was fat but wind noise was apparent and room and interior did not do it for me. Cadillac lost some of it's appeal due to quality and image loss to the ELPS segment. The CTS is a nice try but as usual, missed the mark, IMO.I did test drive the 300C SRT8 and it was great but mileage/residual was a killer. I made my decision toward the end of '05 before $78/barrel hit. I am glad I went with the xi.Regards,OW "

It's definately cheaper than a G35 or Lexus.And to be honest, what's next? 4 second times and 400HP being considered ""weak""? We've already crossed the threshold of what most consumers require in a car in terms of power and speed, so you have to look at the total picture. For instance the GM 3.6 engine - no HP monster, but it's essentially a Honda or Toyota engine tewchnology-wise with the VVT - but in a car that is well under $30k.(Buick LaCrosse CXS) It's a very nice total package that competes well against the Japanese cars in real-life driving. "
"shipo","December 2006"," ...but with better reliability...Oh puleez, your credibility just dropped a bunch of points with a comment like that. You have absolutely no way of knowing whether a new CTS is going to be more or less reliable than any given car produced anywhere and at any time. :P "

If the outgoing CTS has a higher MSRP than the new G35, then I don't like the chance of the new CTS to be cheaper than G35 to happen. "

Lastly, up north, heated seats are a required feature in any luxury car. Again, I think that an automatic CTS with the typical options except for nav. should be priced from the start at less than 30,000. "

But, if we are talking about entry level ""sport"" sedans and willing to forgive the fact that the Lexus' back seat is marginally bigger than the one in my 911......How in the hell isn't a manual transmission option an absolute requirement for entry? I mean we are not talking about 5 passenger luxury sedans here. For which, by the way, the 550i benchmark still has a manual transmission option. But in the case of the IS350, we are essentially talking about a 2+2. The M3 has a bigger back seat. Forget the debate about advertising bribes.

But if one can achieve top ""SPORT"" billing in this segment with a slushbox, what the hell's next? An AMG R63 minivan being crowned the top sports car in the world because it can carry more pounds of professional athletes faster through the 1/4 mile than a Ferrari 430 and Porsche 911 Turbo?R&T really needs to explain their definition of ""sport"".

I'm sure it's the drive-by-wire software, but it had a very detached feel to it, and revs hung so high and long that when you try to heel&toe, the revs actually leap up a few hundred RPM before they slowly start to decay. It was the most unnatural, awkward, and difficult to shift car I've driven in a long time. It's a car that you don't settle into and immediately feel comfortable driving.I will say that I liked the interior, and the suspension tuning was spot on for this segment.

"abergdc","December 2006"," We're looking at manual transmission and nav system. For the GLI, package 2 which gets leather seats and some power stuff, sunroof, somewhat upgraded soundsystem. They are both about $28k before TTL, I figure.We like the pep and handling of the GLI a bit better (we need the leather seats and package 2 because we find the seats in the other GLIs uncomfortable. We like the GLI much more than the 2.0T because of the ride.) The Acura is also fun to drive, has a better interior, more bells-and-whistles, including a much better nav system it seems (voice activation and integration with sound system etc. seem really cool). And of course better expected reliability. We do not want to go over this price, so please don't tell me how much better the BMWs etc. are. I know these cars do not quite make it into this category (""luxury"") but I couldn't find a better place to put this question, as the tsx is discussed here and the VW is about the same price. :-)Thanks for any thoughts.Andy "

Really hard seat bolsters that will likely bruise some full sized American bottoms after only a short jaunt down the highway. We in the U.S. tend to overeat.Guess Infinity only wants to sell to skinny butt buyers. Leaves me and most of us who can afford a car like it to choose another instead. And, oh yeah, I know those bolsters adjust in and out. They were fully out for my test drive. "
"blueguydotcom","December 2006"," The interior of the 07 G actually feels quite tight. I'm a small guy at five-seven and about 145, yet the interior felt like a vice. That said, BMW's new e90 interior feels way too big. I feel like I'm riding in a bathtub. Or a Buick. Really don't like the seating position, windows, layout of my 06 330i. Is350's interior (along with the A4), felt too deep (bathtub again) and tight. e46 interior = heaven. Most current cars have a dash that's too high and side sills that are ridiculously high. The old Civics, the E46 and a handful of other cars got it just right. Low dash, low window sills, decent-sized windows. TSX fits closer to this too. "

Nice interior, although not much different than the regular TL I drove before. Carbon-fiber touch looks very subtle, however I still prefer aluminum. Was disappointed at the power, doesn't appear to be peppy at the low RPM department. Didn't get a chance to really step on it since it was rainy and the sales tagged along with me. What I really like about the TL-S is its sharp steering, definitely beats my IS350 in this category. Bottom line: I like it, but still think the $38K MSRP is overpriced.I am going to check out the new G and 335i today. Hopefully I'll get a chance to drive both of them. "

"
"ggesq","December 2006"," 38k is the sticker price but dealers are discounting them just as they are the 07's. People are buying them for 35k which is pretty much invoice.Are you getting rid of your IS or just having fun? "
"louiswei","December 2006"," Are you getting rid of your IS or just having fun?Oh, I was just having a little fun testing out cars in this segment. I plan on keeping my IS350 for a while. Like I said, I went to check out the G35S and 335i today, also got a chance to test drive them both. Followings are my observations.G35S:I like the exterior design a lot. For some reason even though the general shape remains the same, it looks like a completely new car and better looking. Good job, Infiniti. However, not a big fan on the new grill though. Interior is definitely light years ahead of the older model. Even though the ""washi"" aluminum received some criticism, I'd have to say I like it. However, by looking closely, one can still find cheap plastic being used so I think the G's interior is still behind its competitors. Performance wise, I like the G's sharp steering a lot. Paddle shifter works nicely, no time delay when up/down shifting like the IS. The suspension is obviously softer than the older model but still very adequate for a car in this class. The biggest disappointment for me is the engine. If I had not known its specs before I'd never guess that it has the same HP output as my IS350 (306 HP). It is not peppy at all below 3000 RPM. Even above that mark it still doesn't feel like an engine with over 300 HP.335i:This is the car I afraid to drive the most because I was worried that I might like it so much and couldn't control the urge to trade in my IS350. However, after the test drive, all my worries went away. That being said, the 335i didn't disappoint. As matter of fact, if money is not an issue, this is definitely the ride I'd like to have in my driveway. I was never a fan of the current 3-series' interior but I think I can live with it if I have to. The material used for the interior is top notch of course but I prefer Lexus' and Acura's style. Steering is typical BMW, sharp and precise, no doubt it's the benchmark of the class. The engine is definitely the shining star of this car and boy is it fun to drive or what. Honestly I couldn't feel any turbo lag and it has smooth acceleration from low RPM all the way up to red line. It is definitely quicker than IS350 at below 2500 RPM but pass that I'd say they are pretty even. However, will all the goodies this car has to offer if I am in the market today to buy an ELLPS I would pass on the 335i. Why? Its hefty sticker. With sports package, premium package, comfort access and metallic paint, the MSRP comes to a little bit over $46K. That's $10K over what I paid for my IS350 and the only things it has more are the bluetooth, heated seats and upgraded sports suspension. To me, those things are definitely nice but not $10K nicer. Bottom line: the 335i is obviously the best car in this class but best buy? Not to me. "
"louiswei","December 2006"," scottm123, if you must have AWD then I think your best choice (or best bang for the buck) right now is the G35x. No doubt the 335ix will be nicer and more powerful but that's if you can get over that price. I personally don't care much about the IS250 and would never choose it over the G35x. TL-S is nice but if I am going to drop around $35K on a car I'd like to have either AWD or RWD.Just my 2 cents. "

I have side road options, but they're also nasty when it snows.I've had FWD cars for the first half of my driving life and went to 4WD for the second half.I'm now ready to get back into a sports sedan, and would rather an AWD, than the FWD.

"habitat1","December 2006"," scottm123,Too bad Mercedes isn't offering the new E320 Bluetec with a 4-matic option. Although a pretty big jump in price, it would be my choice for a long distance commuter car under the conditions you describe. Great gas mileage and nearly 400 ft-lbs of torque to more than compensate for the added weight of AWD.The unfortunate issue facing you is that NO AWD equiped ELLPS is going to perform as well as their RWD counterpart when it comes to taking on that Cobalt SS at the stoplight. All of them are hundreds of pounds heavier and give up at least some drivetrain efficiency, compared to running just the rear wheels. In some cases, the added weight also has a significant detrimental impact on the car's handling feel and nimbleness. Having received Audi A4 Quatro service loaners on a couple of occasions, I felt like I was carrying a car full of water buffalos compared to my TL. Great in the rain or snow, not otherwise.

Add one option package on and the price jumps about $7.5K.BMW allows one to configure the car exactly as they want.

"louiswei","December 2006"," I have a base IS350 and the only opted for the 18"" wheel and accessories. However, on the IS, the comfort access comes standard as well as real leather. Not to mention that the peddle shifter is standard as well. The configuration for the 335i I was referring to is: premium package + sports package + comfort access + metallic paint.Premium package includes real leather, digital compass, bluetooth, heated seats, homelink garage opener and few other goodies. All those are standard on the IS except heated seats and bluetooth as I stated before.Sports package includes 18"" wheel, paddle shifter(I want automatic so please don't bring in the ole' manual vs auto dicussion) and sports suspension. Again, as I said, the only thing that my IS350 doesn't have is the sports suspension.Also the comfort access is standard on the IS and Lexus doesn't charge extra for ""metallic"" paint.That being said the 335i comes to around $46.2K MSRP and the IS350 to around $36.5K (I got it for $35.5K). As one can see with all the packages added onto the BMW, the only extras it has over the vanilla Lexus are:Sports suspensionBluetoothHeated seatsAre those worth $10K? Maybe or maybe not. To me?

What were you trying to achieve with that comment?[non-permissible content removed](anese) vehicles tend to include a lot of stuff in the base vehicle & offer one or two option packages. If you want what's in the base vehicle (or exactly what's in the packages), you're golden.If not. . .well, you may end up buying German. Toyota has made a science of studying customer satisfaction & the most efficient way to achieve it. If you fall into the middle of the bell curve, you're their kinda person.If not. . .I don't think we're trying to be obstinate, but some of us want a manual transmission (paying extra for the automatic is a big plus in my book) & not a whole lot else.In my case, handling & possibly audio upgrades -- a German sports package & the upgraded audio & I'm done. Oh, wait, I will pay for leather & a fold-down rear seat (to fit my bicycle). The I Lexi don't even offer a fold-down seat -- that was what eliminated them completely from my consideration, even before I learnt how they handled. Oh, and then the Asian upgraded audio typically comes in a package with tons of s(tuff) I don't want & costs an arm & a leg.So, you got what you want. Great. Some of us can get a BMW for not much more, or possibly less.Different strokes. . .Bear in mind that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Asian car fan. I've driven a lot of miles in my 240-Z (223K), my Miatas (67K), my used 510 (106K) & our current '04 Pathfinder (38K).

I asked him do I need the premium package in order to get leather and he said no. But since that package is so popular they do not order leather without it. He said it could hurt the resale value if one doesn't have premium package. Make sense. He did tell me that I could custom build one if I really don't want the premium package but he doesn't see the point.

Now because you like the 350 better and it comes with everything you want in the base model, it *is* a reason to get the 350 over the 335. But I believe most people wind up with one or more buyers wind up with pricey options on their 350. Just like I believe one or more 335 buyers will be very happy with the base model.

I wonder how much does it cost to get the 18"" wheel alone since the sports package is only $1,600.I agree with you. Yes, my reason to choose IS350 over 335i is because it comes with everything I want in the base model and I like its interior much more. Not because it has paddle shifter and 335i doesn't. I also think that to base the final decision on paddle shifters is ridiculous as well, however, once I got it, it's hard to go back.Also, let's keep in mind that the difference is around $10K. Even if I foregone the paddle shifter and 18"" wheel the difference is still well over $8K. $1,600 for the sports package, I actually think that's a bargain.

Doesn't seem like it should be that hard, but it is!I found out that I can convert BMW from Sirius to XM with an adaptor and I can order a seat that flips down so I thought I was getting close. But none of the dealerships around me have manuals to test drive. I did test one 3 series manual coupe in another state and found that my elbow hit the arm rest every time I shifted. It drove me crazy. Now my dealership is telling me that the arm rest is different if I order a sports package without the premium--e.g. that the sports package alone will solve the problem. Anyone know if there is any truth to that or if I'm being fed a line? It's really hard to buy a car if you can't test drive it.I keep getting such conflicting information. I was also recently told by my local Lexus dealership that I could order a 2007 Lexus IS manual with XM--but that's not what XM says (or what the Lexus webpages show).Any thoughts appreciated.

I was comparing my ideal IS350 to my ideal 335i. It turns out the IS350 for me is base + 18"" but the ideal 335i requires premium + sports + auto + comfort access + metallic.

"habitat1","December 2006"," Not to take sides on your debate with blueguydotcom, but after reading through these posts, I do believe that your personal price comparison between a stripped IS350 and loaded 335i is disingenous at best, deceitful at worst. Maybe not for you personally, based upon your ""ideal"" configuration. But that $10k difference that you come up with is not something that 1% of other buyers would ever experience - and claim that both cars are comparably equiped based upon their own preferences.Also, although I knew you were less of a ""driving enthusaist"" than me (my manual transmission requirement vs. your acceptance of an auto), I didn't realize that you were that ambivalent to driving dynamics. If that's the case, I'm not sure why you aren't driving a TL, which would have saved you another $5-7k+ AND given you a boatlaod of standard equipment that the IS350 lacks. Apples to apples, that's the only $10k difference we have here, far greater than the difference between the IS350 and 335i. If the handling, steering and other dynamic advantages of that sport package equiped 335i are not worth anything to you, than neither should the fact that the TL is FWD be a detraction, given that its actual on road handling, steering, etc. is at least comparable to the IS. In your cost comparison, what I would see as significant performance and feature differences are deemed irrelevant by you. Yet you are willing to pay more for an aesthetic wheel upgrade than I would have paid for on my ""other"" car. It seems to me that your cost benefit analysis of the IS350 vs. 335i is based heavily on image and not a lot on substance. Which is certainly your perogative, but I don't think it is typical of ELLPS shoppers. Certainly not the ones that are ""P"" oriented, but probably not even the ""L"" oriented ones. "
"habitat1","December 2006"," ""Saabs have as much performance if not more performance than a Acura TL""Are you drunk?Back in 2004, I test drove everything remotely in the ELLPS category including Volvo and Saab. When I was back in the market for a convertible last year, I also retried the Saab 9-3 Convertivble. A friend of mine is the general counsel of Saab Aerospace NA and would have been able to get me a spectacular deal, had I been interested. I should have suspected that would not be the case, since he and his wife drive an Acura and Lexus.As much as I would have liked to have been impressed, the Saab driving dynamics were closer to our 1996 Isuzu Trooper than the 2004 TL 6-speed I bought. I won't rip each and every aspect of it, but just try driving a manual transmission Saab and tell me it bears any resemblence to the crisp short throw of the TL or 3 series and I will have the guys from AA pick you up immediately.One things for sure, as much as the hard tops have some issues, you don't ever want to get zesty with one of their convertibles. It's right up there with the Toyota Solara. Or should I say, down there.Saab deserves a lot of credit in certain areas. Their safety engineering is right up there, if not above, Volvo's. They are refreshingly consistent with their unconventional style. They actually seem to have decent reliability, as our neighbor has been milking an early 1990's model for close to 200,000 miles. I would even give the the ticket to enter the ELLPS forum. But, unfortunately, they are a decade behind in serious driving dynamics and performance. I wouldn't have picked any 2005 model offerings over my former 1995 Nissan Maxima SE 5-speed in that area. "
"louiswei","December 2006"," I am going to respond with just this one post...I would like to mention that everything I said is IMO, and please don't take it personal. Also it's funny that how many people would love to tell me how to spend MY $40K on MY ideal car.First of all, I don't like aftermarket rims, they just don't look right with the car. Had them on my previous Honda Accord but much prefer the stock one. As for the FF miles, not everyone has them (at least not that much) as you, blueguy, so it is naive to assume everyone can do what you do. It also doesn't make sense to assume other people have the same lifestyle as you so it'll be great if we can all respect other people's decision once a while.As for habitat1, I understand I was comparing a stripped IS350 to a semi-loaded 335i. However, I said not just once, I wasn't comparing them equipment to equipment I was merely comparing my ideal IS350 to my ideal 335i. If we can't get pass this point then the discussion can't move forward.For all y'all BMW people, help me out here, what are my options if my ""Must Have"" includes:Real Leather18"" wheelComfort accessOther colors besides red, white and blackHomelinkAuto-dimmed MirrorDigital CompassAutomatic transmissionThe sales guy told me in order to get all those on the 335i I'd have to get one with Sports + Premium + Comfort Access + Auto + Metallic. That's how I come up with the $10K difference. I understand a 335i configured this way has more goodies than a stripped IS350 (like HID, auto turning head light, sports suspension, etc). However, those aren't that real important to me. If I can get my ""must haves"" without them for a cheaper price I'd love to do so. But as far as I know that's not possible on the 335i. Right now I am open up to all suggestions so please, entertain me.Let's keep in mind, my ""must haves"" and ""don't really cares"" might be dramatically different than yours. However, I am building this car to satisfy one person, and that's me. Many of you will have different priorities but that's none of my business and frankly I don't really care.Habitat1, to answer your question why am I not in a TL. Actually when I was in the market I had only 3 cars on my list: IS350, 330i and TL. The TL was actually the front runner until I test drove the IS350 then it's all over. I might not be an enthusiast but I like IS' light gas paddle and more powerful engine. I am a hardcore Honda fan (first car Acura Legend, second car Honda Accord) so I prefer TL's interior layout and steering. However, the comfort access, the engine and many other goodies the IS has to offer just make them incomparable IN MY BOOK. Also, even though not the biggest factor but I would love to have RWD on a $35K car. By the way, the TL comes with standard 17"" and the 18"" option (remember, must have) costs about $2.5K if I remember correctly.Anyhow, that's why I am not in a TL right now. You may not understand or agree with my decision but it's not like I didn't do my homework.I'd have to say that I agree with you that I am not your typical ""P"" buyer nor the typical ""L"" buyer. I guess that's how I end up with the IS350 since it is somewhat like an oddball in this group anyway :P . I think if I am the ""P"" buyer I'll be driving either G35 or 330i. On the other hand, if I am the ""L"" buyer than I should end up with either ES350 or C350. "

I'm struggling with the decision (as is evidenced by this forum), but one of the things swaying the G35 in the decision, was that I could get ""built-in"" XM with the vehicle.I asked the BMW salesperson about switching the Sirius module and whether the audio head unit would interface with XM.

The Acura and I would suspect Volvo certainly demonstrate this.Saabs -- to me, at least -- used to be in the ""near premium"" or perhaps near-LPS class alongside Audi and Volvo, to name two Europeans.

Of course, Volvo too, could be thought of or could HAVE been (past tense) thought of to be on a similar trajectory, on a similar bubble.

"habitat1","December 2006"," And, like I said, I respect that it's your perogative to spend your $40k +/- any darn way you wish. I will say that you have enlightened me to a couple of things that I wouldn't have expected. An admitted non-enthusiast to which a sport suspension is unimportant preferring RWD. Maybe we are in role reversal on that one! And, even more ""unique"", factory optional 18"" wheels being a ""must have"" on a compact, non-sport suspensioned sedan.I have not driven an IS 350 w/o the sport suspension. The only time I test drove one was back in the summer when I wanted to satisfy my curiosity and the one they gave me was fully loaded. I hope, however, Lexus learned from their previous faux pas on the previous generation GS400. A business associate of mine bought one with the then optional 17"" sport wheels and tires (standard were 16""). At less than 8,000 miles, the tires were shot. Turns out that the Lexus suspension wasn't up to the task of keeping the soft compound tires firmly planted and there were widespread complaints of premature and uneven tire wear. Lexus refunded the price of the option and provided free replacement 16"" wheels and tires. I realize a lot of people think 17"", 18"", even 19"" wheels look ""cool"" on a ""non-sport"" sedan. Just the other day I almost had a heart attack when I returned to my ""other"" car in a parking lot to find a 55-ish guy bent over looking at the rear of my car. I thought he had run into me. Turns out he was checking out my tires, as he is considering putting 19"" wheels/tires on his wife's Avalon. :surprise: Just a quick realty check for the financially prudent, however: My 1995 Nissan Maxima logged 155k miles on 3 sets of 15"" 215/60 ""H"" rated tires. At $95 a pop for the Eagle RS-A's, that's under $1,200. It's fairly easy to expect that same number of miles will require 6-7 sets of 18"" 45 series tires at, say $200-250 a pop. That works out to $5,000 to $7,000. If I had been that free and loose with my money 12+ years ago for the sake of aesthetics, I wouldn't be driving a car that actually utilizes the capability of 19"" wheels and tires today. "

"plekto","December 2006"," Also remember that the capability of today's tires are vastly better than even a decade or two ago. It's all based upon the tire's maximum weight rating and the contact area.Rim size actually has little or nothing to do with this for anything less than a true sportscar. 15 inchers are more than adequate, for instance, for even a IS350 if they are the right profile, for 99.9% of drivers.But consumers equate bigger rims with better handling, much like how they worship horsepower. But all that gets you is tires that are worse in curves and in the rain that are also more expensive to replace. Thinner, taller tires are more comfortable to ride on, wear better, and turn quicker. But you obviously can't be going super thin/tall, either. But something like a 235/75/15 is more than adequate for anything on the road these days(note - used to be a truck tire - now it can be found on a few higher-end cars) My 67 Mercedes had 185/80/13s on it and never had a problem with traction. $200 for a set, and not the cheapest tires, either, but good Michelins.The suspension also has to be dialed in as hard as a rock to utilize low-profile tires as well(or they wear unevenly), so you get a harder ride. It's a lose-lose situation for anything short of a Saleen or Lotus Elise or Viper.(ie - no luxury here - pure performance is all you get)Oh, and again - they are silly expensive. $150 a tire isn't my idea of low cost of ownership. Not when a $60 tire would have done the same job. "
"spiritinthesky","December 2006"," I am mildly perplexed by some of the numbers being thrown around in this forum. My nephew recently picked up his well equiped 335i in Germany through ED. He ordered it through my dealer. Specs: 335i sedan, 6-speed, premium package, sport package, cold weather package, navigation system, metallic paint. His MSRP was $47,020 (I'm looking at the sticker). He paid exactly $42,000 (roughly $1,300 over ED invoice). The 5 day, 4 night trip cost him a grand total of $1,500, as he booked the airfare well in advance. So, if you want to add the cost of the trip to the car, his total was $43,500.His girlfriend had bought a 2006 IS350 in July, about the time they met. Her car is comparably equiped: sport package and Mark Levinson / Navigation pacakge. Her MSRP was approximately $43,600. The comparable 2007 has an MSRP of $44,105. She negotiated a $1,800 discount, for a total equivalent of $42,305. I'm guessing that's not a great discount, but not horrible.Guys, this is a toss up. The IS has an automatic. If you need one, that's another $1,300 in the BMW. But both my nephew AND his girlfriend prefer driving his 335i significantly more. I've driven both and the 335i engine feels much more powerful, the steering more precise, the handling crisper... Yes, I own an M5 so call me biased if you want. But the point is, there is hardly any price difference between the final cost of these cars. Throw in BMW's all inclusive maintenance, and you are talking about lunch money insignificance.Perhaps the more important difference is practicality. My wife and I have gone out with them on several occasions. My nephew is 6'2"", his girlfriend 5'7"". My wife (5'5"") and I (5'11"") have a very difficult time fitting comfortably in the IS350. The 335i isn't exactly M5 sized, but the difference is significant. We fit quite comfortably in the rear seat. To call the IS350 a four adult passenger sedan is being generous.So, for anybody who is using this forum to shop, rather than defend their previous purchase, I would highly recommend you test drive and consider both cars. The price difference is not significant. The attributes can be, depending upon your needs and preferences.P.S. Rumor has it that he is popping the question to her this New Years Eve. At least they previously worked out that, if they were ever to ""get together"", she would trade her IS350 for a RX400h. "

Check out Tire Rack when it comes time to replace yours. For my Acura TL 6-speed, there were tires ranging from a wear rating of 140 to 340.

"joe131","December 2006"," Nope.Tire tread wear ratings are only useful when comparing tires made by the same manufacturer. A 400 rating in one brand may wear out sooner than a 300 rating of another brand.http://www.discounttire.com/dtcs/infoTreadwear.dos puts it like this:The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear of a tire when tested carefully under controlled conditions. For example, a tire graded 400 should have its useful tread last twice as long as a tire graded 200. Another tire manufacturer, however, may grade a comparable design 300, so a grade of 150 would last just half as long under their grading scheme. The lesson learned is to not use one manufacturer's grade versus the other, but instead to compare tire grades within a given brand. "

And the relative tire rating is still worth considering.And, FWIW, although Discount Tire seems to have competitive prices, I recommend doing research by surfing the Tire Rack site and speaking directly with their sales peaple. They conduct their own road tests and, IMO, seem to be the most knowledgeable. Discount Tire carries 3 different tires that fit the front wheels of my car, but not a single rear tire.

After a year a C55 AMG is expected. If the current German horsepower war continues, there's room under the hood for a C63 AMG, ready to out-gun even the upcoming V-8-engined BMW M3.The new C-Class uses front strut suspension with two lower-arms, and a multi-link rear axle - familiar Benz principles. The main chassis innovation is a new type of amplitude-dependent damper, able to provide extra compliance over small bumps for ride comfort but stiffening up during bigger movements caused by sharp steering maneuvers. The system is entirely hydraulic - there's no electronic intervention.The bodyshell is a claimed 13 percent more torsionally rigid than before, enhancing comfort by reducing vibration, as well as giving the potential for more precise handling.

If Lexus won't offer manual on the IS-F then I don't like the chance of GS-F and SC-F getting it. Hopefully Lexus will wise up and decide to give their upcoming halo car, LS-F, either a manual tranny or SMG straight from their F1 cars.Let me make myself clear first, I am not trying to defend AMG's decision on not offering manual on their entries, however I think there are at least 2 reasons:1. AMG is more of a super luxury cruiser with sports aspiration. Those cars are not serious ""sports"" such as Porsche, Ferrari or even M and Audi's S/RS. Thus their targeted market is vastly different and mostly aren't interested in ""shift-'emselve"".2. Americans traditionally buy more automatic than manual. I believe the auto-to-manual ratio for the 3-series sold in US is around 70-30 and this maybe your most ""sporty crowd"".

Chipping has been really common with those engines for about a decade and they're all running fine. Yes, some blow up their engines or strip trannys but that's the drivers, not the engines.Second, BMW couldn't officially release the 335i with 350/400 tq for one simple reason: M3. The M3 is using a variant of that torqueless V10 in the M5/M6. It's going to produce - if they're lucky - 420 hp and 330/340 tq. If they released a 335i with more torque and nearly the same power they'd eat into M3's sales in a big way. Right now at 330 hp the 335i is pulling 4.9-4.7 0-60 runs. That's besting/matching the current M3. The next get M3 which will be heavier will be lucky to pull sub-4.6 second runs to 60. quite simply once you reach sub-5 seconds every drop from there takes serious torque and HP. Guys with chipped 335is are pulling mid 4 second 0-60 runs. What would BMW gain from having the 38k 335i run to 60 as fast as the 60k 2008 M3? BMW is not dumb.Correct, see above. They have to protect the M3 name.Capitalism. Its a system based on the old adage, there's a sucker born every minute.The sucker is the one who thinks a manufacturer limits power to increase engine life and not protect the top of its sales line. The profit margins on the M3 are surely insane and they sell in really high numbers. Look at the sales of the e46 M3 v. the e46 coupes. Not a big difference. Yet the price gap was massive. Look at the differences between the M3 and 330i of the e46...yeah the M3 sales were neck and neck and more profitable. Plus it makes the brand look better.Or am I just too cynical?Nah. Just not looking at the whole picture. "

"jensb","December 2006"," Please keep me posted on this. My, perhaps mistaken, understanding was that ""the box"" was available and could be installed. I wasn't informed it would affect the warranty. As for plugging an aftermarket in, I've had that for the past two years. It certainly doesn't look very good and is not very user-friendly--though maybe they've improved them. I started out with Sirius and switched to XM and like the latter much better. It really is a deal-stopper for me (as is manual transmission). So I would love to know if the ""box"" is a viable option. Again, who would have thought it would be this hard?!

I suppose you'll answer because BMW ain't dumb, it just must protect the upcoming 2009 M5?And what was VW protecting by not putting higher performance chips in those you mentioned?(Oh, and the 335i is 300 HP and 300 Torque.

"joe131","January 2007"," What is your authority stating BMW warranty covers Dinan performance chips? I could not find any support for it.But I did read a little which tends to show you may be in for big warranty headaches if there is engine failure in a re-chipped car.Consider these tidbits from the Bimmerfest message board:1. He (Dinan) actually does void the (BMW) factory warranty... he just states that he matches it if there is an issue... if there is a problem, BMW will not cover, and (if) you can prove that it was dinan's fault.. then dinan pays... if you cannot prove it was dinan's fault... and BMW will not cover... you are HOSED (S.O.L.)! (And remember, unless you pay a whole lot extra,the Dinan warranty only lasts until the original BMW factory warranty expires.)2. ALL Dinan products void BMW's warranty. It's just that Dinan offers a (concurrent) warranty to supposedly cover any warranty denials by BMW. But Dinan products DO void the BMW warranty.3. (here I am paraphrasing an entry posted by a lawyer)If you make a claim for BMW warranty coverage and BMW decides (as it almost certainly will in the event of engine failure where a Dinan chip is installed) that BMW does not need to pay for the repair, you will need to go to court to pursue your claim further. And once there, even though the burden is on BMW to prove that the Dinan chip caused the damage, it probably would not be a difficult thing for a jury to find. And when the jury does find the aftermarket chip was the cause, the BMW warranty is voided for that damage claim. So then you end up with a claim against the Dinan warranty. But to win against Dinan, you as a plaintiff must prove that the Dinan chip caused the damage. If you don&#146;t get a jury to agree on that, you lose and the Dinan warranty will not pay either. And even before many months or years waiting to get to the courtrooms, you either pay out of your pocket for the repairs, or do without the car as you hope one warranty will eventually be forced to cover the damage.Bottom line: Do not re-chip your BMW while it is under the factory warranty.

"louiswei","January 2007"," ajmtbm, I think the new G35 right now is the best bang for the bucks in this class. Given their similar pricing there is no way I would opt the IS250 over the G. However, after test drove the G35 last week I think there are at least 2 reasons why the Lexus and Bimmer cost more:1. Interior build quality and inferior material used. Generally speaking the new G's interior is light years ahead of its predecessor. However, one can still find cheap material being used in the cabin, for example, lower door panel.2. Less refined engine. Don't get me wrong, the new VQ is very good and competitive. But I don't think its as refined as Lexus' 2GR-FSE and Bimmer's twin-turbo I6. I drove the G35 and 335i back to back and I have an IS350 so trust me, there is a difference.I am not sure if BMW and Lexus' advantage over Infiniti in those 2 area are worth $5K more expensive. That's up to the customers to decide. "

"spiritinthesky","January 2007"," blueguydotcom,I generally agree with your posts and appreciate your insights. However, I have some disagreement with your most recent one:My nephew recently purchased a 335i sedan. While it diplays impressive acceleration for a ""regular"" 3 series, the overall performance still falls well short of the M3, especially in the area of handling. What distinguishes the M3 from all of its competition is near 911 quality steering and handling. You don't get that with an aftermarket Dinan chip. And the 335i, while an ELLPS segment leader, will never play with a 911 around a track, chipped or not. Secondly, as others have pointed out, the Dinan chips do indeed pose a warranty risk. A significant one. I have several fellow M5 owners who have looked into it and all concluded that you better have the intestinal fortitude to go to court. Thirdly, hand built ""M"" engines are at least 3+ times as expensive to produce as their non-M mass produced counterparts. If you've ever visited both factories, as I have, you immediately know why. While I don't dispute that the profit margins on the M3 and M5 are high, most of that is because 90% of M models are sold at full MSRP, with no discounting or ED discounts. My nephew bought a 335i for the equivalent of $1,500 under US invoice via European Delivery. For those that might think the difference between a 335i and an M3 is a 0-60 time that can be bridged by a Dinan chip, I respectfully suggest they don't really know what Motorsports is all about and what separates them from the horsepower addicted drag racers over at AMG. Sorry if I sound defensive. My loyalty to ""M"" goes back to being an original owner of an M1. It's pretty easy to pump the power of a turbo engine. A hell of a lot harder to live by the mantra, ""make the chassis faster than the engine"". And nobody in the sport sedan and coupe market does that better than Motorsports. "

In 2001 you could get it with 150 hp in the Jetta/Passat. In 2002 the power was bumped to 180 but structurally nothing was different. The exhaust was slightly different but really what changed: ecu. That same engine in the TT made 225 hp. And what was VW protecting by not putting higher performance chips in those you mentioned?See above. The 150 hp 2001 Jetta v. 180 hp 2001 A4 and TT. Eventually VW put the A4 and Jetta at the same power levels as they realized most people don't opt for a Jetta over an A4 or vice versa. Currently the 2.0T in the A4, A3, Jetta, Passat and GTI makes 200 hp. Well, the upcoming TT will make 220 hp - same engine.Oh, and the 335i is 300 HP and 300 Torque. Just drove a coupe a couple weeks ago. Pretty car.)Again,do some research. Dynos show the 335i makes ~330/330. BMW's marketing guys say 300/300. The SAE rules make it impossible to overrate an engine (like honda did the TL for years) but they don't bar a company from underrating the engine. Why underrate the 335i? Two reasons:1. The competition is around the 300s. So to stay level but offer more performance BMW simply claims 300/300. If the G35 or IS350 sees a bump to 320, BMW can match without ever changing a thing.2. The last year of the M3 and even the upcoming e9x M3. The current M3 is a lame duck. At 50k+ it's a hardsell to push someone into an e46 M3 when the e9x 335i makes the same power for less money. The e9x M3 will make far more power but really the performance reward won't be huge. So BMW must make the gulf seem large enough on paper to entice people to drop 65k of so for an e9x M3 in 08. "

Period.Time for my soapbox...I would point out that even the factory warranty on an unmodified car can be ""muddy"" in certain cases. For example, if your clutch burns out after only 15,000 miles, is it a defective tranny or did you destroy it with abuse? This exact situation has happened to people on these very forums (including myself 2 years ago with my old Acura), and the decision whether the dealership covered the repairs or not seems to be about 50/50.The parts and service folks at my local BMW dealer all know me by first name - and I've never spent more than $50 there at a time. I'm in there probably a couple times each month to buy a $6 oil filter, $3 worth of 7mm screws, or something like that. That's it. They always smile and say hello when I come in, talk about E30's for a few minutes, and then, half the time, they give me my parts for free. If it's not in stock, they have even overnight drop shipped parts to my home - no charge.When I brought my Acura in with a moaning clutch 2 years ago, no questions were asked. The Acura dealer took care of me without hesitation. Other people have not been so lucky. Why? IMO, your automobile is one of your biggest investments, and like your accountant, lawyer, or bank branch manager, you should have a personal relationship with the people who help you take care of it. If you're an enthusiast (and what Dinan customer isn't to some extent), you should want to be an ""insider"" with the dealership people who are ""in the know.""You'll never have a problem with warranty support, Dinan modified or bone stock, if you do this.

If there is one brand I am being loyal to that's Honda/Acura but as you can see I passed on the TL for IS350. The biggest throwback on the 3er for me is the interior. If that didn't get improvement for the next gen then there is no way I'll be paying for one. I would probably still consider it and cross-shop it like I did before but if I don't really like the interior, don't really see myself getting one. However, if BMW brings back e46's interior then it's a different story all together. Yes, I know I am an interior nut, it is as important to me as the sport suspension and manual tranny to blueguy :P . "

"dafreak1","January 2007"," I am looking at buyingthe new G35 and am wondering why it would not be considered the best buy in this segment. I can get a loaded G35 for 40K. That includes nav, rear view camera, upgraded stereo and all the other goodies. What am I missing? I have looked at the BMW and the Lexus and I can not figure out why anyone would choose them over the G35? I am not a race car driver and like performance and luxury while still having some room to carry passengers and luggage. Can someone please tell me what I am missing and why a similarily equiped BMW 335 for $50K is a better buy? "
"qbrozen","January 2007"," the short answer is ... it performs better.Some folks would choose performance over options. Individual preferences is what makes the world go 'round. "
"dafreak1","January 2007"," It performs better in what manner? From my understanding the G35 outperformed and/or held its own against the 335? I would like to own the 335 I just can not justify it. It seems like you are paying for the name. "
"louiswei","January 2007"," To answer your question, G35 is definitely the best buy comparing to the (hint: key words) similarly equipped 335i and IS350. However, not everyone choose the same feature as you do so if all I want is Navi and willing to drop 40 big ones then I'd go for IS350 over the G due to its better fit and finish and performance. On the other hand if gadgetry/features is all I care about then yes the G is definitely a better choice.I got a question, have you test drive all 3 cars? I did. I was surprised by the lack of power of the new VQ and couldn't believe this engine is rated the same at horsepower output as the 2GR-FSE. As the new G35 Sport's suspension is obviously softer than before so it sort of lost the ""cheaper 3-series alternative"" title.So the bottom line is:The G35 doesn't handles better than the Bimmer, doesn't out-power the Bimmer and Lexus and has an inferior interior than the Lexus. I think Infiniti took the middle road this time around. They are trying to do well in every area but not great in one or two particular.Best buy for features and overall package? Yes. Class leader in any area? No. It all depends on what the buyer wants. You can't really go wrong with any car in this class. "
"plekto","January 2007"," Just get an older generation G35 I still don't understand the IS250, though. They should have kept the IS300 instead of de-powering it and creating a fancy commuter-box. In fact, I'd take a used IS300 over a new IS250 in a second - total no-brainer, like the older G35 is. "
"dafreak1","January 2007"," Thanks for the reply and yes I did drive all three. I guess for me I am not looking for the most powerful car I can find. What I am looking for is a capable sport sedan that also is luxurious enough to be my everyday driver. So yes, features and gadgetry are important to me. I really liked the Lexus interior but the car was way too small for me. As far as the BMW, I like the exterior a lot but am not crazy about the interior or the lack of interior space. I guess the G35 satisfies bith sides of the spectrum for me while at the same time allowing me affordable luxuries. "
"dafreak1","January 2007"," I had one for 3 years and to be honest I prefer the new G35 over the last. I like the seats better, the ride, the feel and the upgraded interior. Maybe I am leaving my youth and entering the ""next"" step. If I really thought it was worth it I would splurge for the M35 but I just dont htink I am quite ""there"" yet. "
"louiswei","January 2007"," I think the IS250 is going to recieve a power boost sooner or later or they should just bring the IS300 back. I believe what Toyota was trying to do is make all their 6 cylinder engines GR-series thus reduce the production and maintenence cost. However, they are still using the 3.0 I6 on their IS in China (China doesn't get the IS250/350). Older G35 is nice but lacks the power and improved interior that the new one has. Personally I think Honda Accord has better interior than the outgoing G35.plekto, the fancy commuter-box is selling well these days. I think the IS250 out sell IS350 at least 2 to 1 if not 3 to 1. "
"qbrozen","January 2007","  From my understanding the G35 outperformed and/or held its own against the 335?Where did you get that from? Since when can the G35 hit 60 mph in less than 5 secs? "
"louiswei","January 2007"," I guess the G35 satisfies both sides of the spectrum for me while at the same time allowing me affordable luxuries.There you go, that's your justification to buy the G35. It's nice to get all the advice you can before the purchase but I would strongly suggest you let your ""heart"" makes the final buying decision. It is ultimately you whom is going to be driving the car and living with it for the upcoming year.Oh, BTW, if I let this board to make my purchasing decision I'll be driving a Bimmer for sure :P .Good luck on your purchase, seem to me you have already made the decision but let us know what you ultimately decide on.

"qbrozen","January 2007"," Its only $10k more if you get it loaded up. Not everyone wants all that extra stuff.The base model would make me very happy, and at ~$36k euro delivery, its tough to argue against it, IMHO.And, don't get me wrong, I am a strong supporter of the G35, too ... if you like the looks. I find the sedan to be pretty homely. Of course, many feel that way about the bimmer. Again, its all about preferences.sorry... i keep editing this post ... but wanted to add something else. There are certain features I do want that come standard in the 335, like memory seats and bluetooth. So to get a G35 to that level (and since i want manual tranny), I gotta take a sport model with premium pack. With my VPP discount, that's somewhere around $32,500. Yes, a great bargain for such a vehicle ... but only a few grand more for the added performance of the 335 would be too tough for me to turn down. "

I just dont see how the car is worth 10K more and believe me, I would like to cause I have always wanted a BMW."" Looks like another case of financial misconception. Go back and read my post #7376. As I indicated therein, my nephew picked up a 335i via European Delivery for $42,000 even - with sport, luxury packages, navigation and metallic paint (US MSRP of $47k+). That covers just about every ""gadget"" you could want, in a car that is three notches up from the G35 in driving dynamics (my nephew briefly considered the Infiniti). Even if you add 100% of the cost of the 5 day trip to Germany to the price, his grand total was only $43,500.I'm not on BMW's payroll, so I don't care what you buy. But you should base your decision on accurate ecomomics. And if a loaded G35 actually costs $40k, the difference to a loaded 335i is not much, assuming you don't have a fear of flying. Also, in the event you might sell the car in less than 7 years and 100k miles, do yourself the favor of checking out resale values as well. Last time I checked, Infiniti would place a very distant third to Lexus and Acura in that area. I'd bet a paycheck of mine that a $43.5k loaded 335i will cost you a LOT less than a $40k G35 over 3-4 years factoring BMW's free maintenance and each car's resale value at that time. A LOT less. "
"joe131","January 2007"," fed, you missed my point about the cars under the new car warranty.You posted, ""...They (Dinan) don't ""get to decide"" whether they're at fault...""Hahaha! Well of course they get to decide whether they think their part is defective. That is the first thing they look at when deciding whether or not to pay for any damage claimed against their warranty!You did not paste the entire warranty in your post. Neither did I. You seem to emphasize the word ""will"" in the part of the warranty you pasted. But you need to realize that in order for the ""will"" to occur, Dinan must first agree that their part was defective. If Dinan denies their part is defective, then their warranty will not automatically pay for repairs. You may have to go to court to try to force them into paying. ""...the vehicle must be brought, upon discovery of a defect in material and workmanship, to the workshop of any Dinan Authorized Center, during normal business hours. The authorized Center will, without charge...""http://www.dinancars.ca/newlook/html/warranty.htmAnd I'll repeat: talk to or read of those who have actually made warranty claims concerning the aftermarket chips. Then you can make better guesses.And sarcasm is not humor. "
"louiswei","January 2007"," Okay, let's get even less ""Voodooer""...I like the figure $43.5K because you included the trip cost. I think in order to compare apples to apples we should all include airfare ticket, lodging and food on top of the ED price.However, the $40K figure you used to the G35 is MSRP. Unless one is a moron or just arrived in this country NOBODY buys cars in MSRP. Right now without any negotiation one can get $1K off the sticker for a G35 so with a little haggle I think $1.5K is realistic.With that in mind the difference comes to around $5K for a loaded G35 vs. loaded 335i. "
"joe131","January 2007"," Try sitting in the driver's seat of a manual transmissioned G35 for more than 1/2 an hour or so. You may get bedsores from the pressure points.Terribly uncomfortable seats unless you have no butt.(the automatic versions are much more comfortable in the seating dept.) "
"spiritinthesky","January 2007"," Thanks for the clarification, but please note that I did qualify my previous post with:""And if a loaded G35 actually costs $40k"" I wasn't aware of the accuracy of that figure and I accept your correction that the difference in purchase price is closer to $5k. However, I would still subtract from that difference 4 years and 50k miles of maintenance included in the BMW. Not sure what that would cost on the Infiniti. Hopefully a lot less than the $6,000 I just estimated for my new 911 Turbo. But likely at least $1,500 if they do decent 10k mile interval services.Bottom line is that full and accurate financial comparisons should be done before jumping to any conclusions. I might think that an extra ""net"" $3,500 for the 335i up front is a great deal, since it will likely be worth $5k+ more in 3-4 years than the Infiniti and offer a lot more rewarding of a driving experience in the meantime. But I respect that for some, an extra $5,000 up front is a straw breaking the camel's back. But at least we should be looking at the same accurate cost figures and the full picture, including maintenance and resale values, when we reach our own subjective conclusions. If it is down to nickels, one should also look at insurance costs and gas mileage. But I hope that it doesn't need to get to that level for a $40k ELLPS. After all, there are many nice $25k cars for those who need to be a bit more prudent than shooting their wad at a young(er) age. "
"dafreak1","January 2007"," 43.5 does bring it more in line. However, I havethree little kids and a wife and I do not think it would be prectical for me to fly to Germany to buy a car.

Now, as far as the ED goes, tell me more abouot that process and the time involved, etc. Do you negotiate on the car or is it ifxed price? "
"qbrozen","January 2007"," well.... i don't like to argue these points, but i don't think adding trip cost is completely fair. I mean, you ARE getting a trip. So its not like the car cost that much, its the car plus a trip that cost that much.by the way, i'm not wholly familiar with the bmw euro program. Is NOTHING included? For instance, Volvo's program includes airfare and a couple of nights in a hotel.  "
"spiritinthesky","January 2007"," If you are interested in learning more about the BMW European Delivery program, go to your local dealer and ask for an explanation. It does have some trade offs - you need to order the car, pay for it upon production and there will be a delay of 3-4 weeks after your ""pick up"" trip to Germany and when you actually have the car delivered to you (through the local dealer) back in the US. The basic ED savings is about 7% off the US MSRP. Many dealers will tell you this is ""non-negotiable"". Wrong. Just tell them that a friend (I'll volunteer) told you that his dealer will further discount the ED price to $1,500 over the ED invoice. The dealer mark up on ED is basically the same percentage as the invoice to MSRP markup on a US car. So there is definitely room to get another 4-5% off the ED price.Another secret: The ED cars do NOT come out of a dealers ""allocation"" for US sales. So when a car is ""hot"", like the 335i is right now, a dealer might not want to discount a US delivered much, since he will only be getting a limited number of units. But if he sells you a car via European Delivery, its a ""bonus"" sale that counts towards dealer incentives from BMW, but doesn't reduce the number of 335i's he will get to sell here. I've pretty much told you everything I know. I only pay cash for cars, so I'm not familiar with the financing or lease options avaliable through ED. But I'm sure the dealer can help you there.This is NOT an attempt to dissuade you from getting a G35. But given your ""circumstances"", I would also suggest considering a TL. Less expensive still, wery good performance (FWD notwithstanding), all the do-dads you could want, better fit and finish, and excellent resale. Thank my nephew for that assessment.Good luck. "
"dafreak1","January 2007"," Thanks for the info, I will check into it a bit. As far as the TL goes, I have a 2006 loaded one right now. It is nice and all but it is not in the same category as the G35 I owned before it. It has nowhere near the fun factor. I feel like I am in an old man's car. Anyway, I have owned it about a year and am ready for something else again. I was impressed with the new G35 and have been offered what I think is a fair deal on it and my trade. Thanks again. "
"jblaze13","January 2007"," You are never going to convince the BMW lovers. If someone wants to pay that much more for driving dynamics that are marginally better and probably never to be used let them. Most consumers aren't racing their 3 series or G35 through the slolam and will never notice the ever so slight advantages the 3 series may have. What most consumers will notice is how much more passenger space the G35 has. They will notice how much less money it costs. The G35 is a better ""VALUE"". The 3 series is a more visually appealing vehicle. Many car magazines had the last generation G35 beating the last generation 3 series as well as other competitors. Check Car and Driver March 2004. It doesn't seem that this generation G35 enjoys such a feat but it is definitely right on the heels of the 3 series. My advice, buy the G35 if you don't need to say you have a bimmer. "

I ask, as the 335i currently has a much higher residual and lower Money Factor than the G.For a 3 yr, 15k/yr lease, the 335i is about $30-40 more per month than the G. I looked at both vehicles farily well contented and ultimately decided on the 335i.My choice was the 335i, but my choice may have been different if purchasing. "
"cdnpinhead","January 2007"," Either way, you still have to buy gasoline, and spending 20-25% less could matter. On each of my vehicles last year I spent ~$2K on gas, so $400-500 a year works out to ~$40/month. The Infiniti engine is a lot of things, but fuel efficient isn't one of them. The BMW gets kudos for mileage on a regular basis.Sounds like a wash on the two leases when fuel is factored in. "

And that's why the G will always be priced less, because Infiniti can't command the money BMW will easily get.The G has power, but is a little rough around the edges and the brakes wear out VERY quick.

"pv2","January 2007"," Have to dispute your comments about iffy performance and traction in FWD. I've owned two BMW 328Ci's (1997 & 2000 - with sport and luxury pkgs.) then switched to an Acura CL Type S in 2003 and just bought a 2007 TL Type S. RWD can be marginally better at the limit (which is less than 1% of my driving and likely similar for others). In the NE, snow tires and wheels ($1000+) are essential for winter traction. My CL with all season tires never gave me any concerns; unlike my BMWs, which would either go sideways or at 1 mph with traction control (with summer tires). So for me the performance difference (advantage BMW and Infiniti - drove both recently) doesn't outweigh other factors. As for cost, comparably equipped the 335 is $10-12k more than I paid and the G would be $3-5k more. In addition, the materials in the TL are one or two notches better than either and the reliability is bullet-proof. Absolute performance is overrated unless you're using it a lot of the time. Excellent performance, reliability and all the other toys can be had for less. Different strokes.  "

"mnrep2","January 2007"," compared to the weakling Infiniti AWD systemHave you driven the Infiniti in deep snow, hard pack snow up a hill around corners at speed? If you had you wouldn't make such a foolish statement. The Nissan ATTESA AWD on the Infiniti is rock solid and has a long backround on their legendary super car R33 Skyline GT-R. It works like this: A 16bit microprocessor monitors the cars movements at 100 times per second to sense traction loss. Three G-Sensors mounted underneath the center console feed lateral and longtitudinal inputs into an ECU. The ECU can then direct up to and including 50% of the power to the front wheels. When slip is detected on a wheel, the system directs the torque away from that wheel to one that has traction. Torque is apportioned using a clutch pack center differential, similar to the type employed in the Steyr-Daimler-Puch system in the Porsche 959. This series of clutch packs is contained within the 'transfer case,' which is mounted to the rear of the gearbox.Rather than locking the AWD in all the time or having a system that is ""all or nothing"", the ATTESA E-TS system can apportion different ratios of torque to different wheels as it sees fit. This provides the driver with an AWD vehicle that performs like a rear wheel drive vehicle in perfect conditions and can recover control when conditions aren't as perfect. Wow that sounds quite inferior... "

What if you use Mobil 1 0W-40? If your paint becomes prematurely oxidized during the warranty period, will BMW deny you when they determine that your paint has never been waxed?If you blow the tweeter on your left rear speaker after listening to your I-Pod through an FM modulator, can BMW deny you?Joe, I can think of a thousand things (the list is endless, really) that BMW could theoretically raise a stink about.

"habitat1","January 2007"," From my research of Volvo, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche European Delivery programs, the thing that appears to set BMW apart from Volvo and Mercedes is that the ED prices can be further negotiated. If you are comparing list ED prices to actual discounted US prices on certain models, the ED doesn't appear to save you that much on BMW, Volvo and Mercedes. But getting another 4-5% whacked off the ED price makes the savings much more substantial on BMW. I tried that on Volvo when were considering the XC90 V8 and got nowhere. Same with Mercedes.Porsche is in a league of their own. They charge you MORE for the privaledge of picking the car up at the factory. And yet I know of several enthusiasts who have done it multiple times.I would be hard pressed to buy a new BMW in the US knowing what I found out about ED. Unfortunately, the discounting doesn't apply to the M3 or M5. But the savings on a 550i 6-speed would bring it to pennies more than a 530i in the US. "

Infiniti has the heaviest, then Acura, Lexus has the lightest and BMW is somewhere in the middle. Come to think about it this phenomenon doesn't happen just on these ELLPSs. I remember my old Accord has heavier gas pedal than my parents' Camry and 4Runner as well. So I think traditionally Honda's gas pedals are heavier than Toyota's.This could also explain why although the new G35 has 306 HP, it doesn't feel as punchy as the IS350.My question is, what's the cause(s) to have some manufactures having heavy gas pedals and others having light ones?

"laurasdada","January 2007"," Since I do spend a fair amount of time driving my car whilst in its interior ( :surprise: ), an interior design, as well as suitable materials, that appeals to me is important.To me, it appears that the Bangle-led design team spent so much time trying to ""flame surface"" the exteriors and tack on horrendous (in varying degrees, 6 series is the most egregious of offenders) bustle backs of the BMWs that the interiors seem to be an afterthough. Even a non-thought. The materials seem high quality to me, and if they were seeking a minimalist, blunt and totally Orwellian 1984, Apple Super Bowl commercial of many years ago function over form (and, yes, I know this is nirvana to some: BG.com comes to mind)interior, well then, kudos!

In other words, while sitting in traffic or at stop lights or just hiding from the family in my TL in the garage...), the artistry of interior (and exterior for the times I am approaching, washing or just lovingly gazing at my car) design, without noticeably compromising functionality, well then BMW is not so successful. I especially dislike the ""two hooded"" look of the main instument pod and nav/IDrive screen. BMW is not the only offender here, and thankfully it is an option on the 3.I enjoy driving. I also enjoy the car as art (see Jaguar XK, Aston Martin DB9/V8 and, of course, Acura TL :blush: ). Each BMW Bangle design since the pre-freshened 7 series seems to be just a bit less of a Bangle design. That is good. But the interiors, to me aren't improving. To me.

"nyccarguy","January 2007"," I'm not saying the G35 or IS350 are bad cars, they are just not for me. From what i've noticed reading these boards and from personal experience is that many people who are buying the Japanese Luxury/Sport Sedans are always defending their cars not only by singing their many praises (In their minds), but by many times saying that they could have bought the BMW but...I've never heard it the other way around. Most of the people I know who own German cars love the way they drive and maybe they are not as ""perfect"" as their Japanese counterparts, but they don't long to own any particular Japanese make or model.A few examples:1. My best friend does a lot of driving (between 35,000 & 40,000 miles per year). He leases cars. Besides his personal car, he often drives family members' cars who are under their lease miles. A few years ago he drove his sister's E46 325iA with SPort Package for about 6 months. When the time came for his wife to get a car a few months after that, he got her a TL. He got a great ""deal"" on the car (a comparable BMW was much more to lease at the time due to an Acura factory program). Ask him what he thinks about the Acura. He'll tell you it has a nice interior, it is roomy and comfortable, and he likes all the bells and whistles. He'll also tell you it rides too soft, has terrible torque steer, & sloppy handling. He says he'd take the 184hp 325i (E46) over the Acura if he could do it all over again. Next time he's going German.I have a friend who lives in South Florida. He and his wife moved there from Michigan. 6 months after they moved, she is getting her 330Cic serviced and is poking around the showroom. Falls in love with a White/Cinamon/Black Top M3 Cic. Started talking to a sales person. She took the M3. My buddy and his wife lost A LOT of money because she traded in the 330Cic (still had 1+ year to go on her lease) and forked over the HUGE security deposit from it as a CAp Cost Reduction on the M3 and to pay for the remaining lease payments on the 330Cic (plus I'm sure they were sold the car at sticker and the mf on the lease was bumped up). Her lease payment essentially DOUBLED. Guess what...They've got the car for 3 years and enjoy every second of it. No regrets!I'm not saying to be stupid and break the bank or go in over your head on a car you can't afford. But if you like a certain car (say a BMW) drives, life's too short to compromise if you can afford it. "
"shouldiwait","January 2007"," BMWs are over-rated cars except for perhaps the M3. I own a 2000 323i. Bought it brand new for $34000+ tax when it first came out. At 52000 miles, the oxygen sensors broke and costed over $500 to replace. At the same mileage, the high and low power steering pressure hose leaked, $300 to replace by a local mechanic. Wouldn't even want to think what the dealer would charge. Just replaced the back window regulator for $300. I am afraid the other 3 may break soon. At the current 67000 or so miles, I am about the replace a 3rd set of brakes. Keep in mind that BMW requires that you replace the rotors when the pads are changed. Now let's get back to the current BMW 335 sedan. A fully equipped one in auto (premium & sport package, cold weather package and navigation) is close to $48000. Let's say that I can get $2000 discount, this is $46000 + tax/fees. I just bought a Type S for $35600 including (mud guards, wheel locks, rubber mat and trunk tray). That's over $10000 cheaper than a BMW 335. You do the math. I think both cars get the same look.Forgot to add that I also got 4.9%.

I don't know if, on the TL-S, they have a firmer ""sport"" suspension on the 6-speed - they did on my 2004, along with Brembo brakes.All of that said, the TL and TL-S are extremely nice, well balanced, sporty family sedans. I would heartily recommend one to friends looking for that blend of sport, luxury, features and value.But comparing a FWD TL-S to a 335i, which is a true high performance RWD sport sedan is not a fair comparison. Certainly, if the added performance of the 335i is not of value to you, then the extra $10k is a waste of money. But there is a difference between a well balanced, sporty family sedan and a serious sports sedan. The TL/TL-S is the former and the 335i is the latter. "

If there are inaccurate statements toward any of these cars (3er included) I think it's everybody's responsibility to clear that up so someone that's here for information wouldn't be misled. The owners know their own cars best so it is obvious for an IS350 to defend the IS and TL owner to defend TL as so on.I think we are all adults here and are mature enough to admit buyers' remorse if there is one.Classic example of how 3er owners defend their cars: ""the handling is the best and it'll beat any car on a track"".Classic example of how IS owners defend their cars: ""awesome acceleration (350 owners), best interior in the class, typical Lexus quality/reliability"".Classic example of how G35 owners defend their cars: ""3er replacement for much less of its price, the best value in class"".Classic example of how TL owners defend their cars: ""toy-rich standard equipment, although FWD but handles superbly, also the best value in class"".Sounds familiar?

There is. Does that mean they aren't both ""ELLPS""? I'm not necessarily suggesting that. But you've already admitted that - other than straight line accleeration - you don't really care about the ""P"" in performance. That's fine, but that shouldn't be extrapolated into some objective conclusion that one is a better value than the other becuase it's cheaper, when in fact, it offers far less ""P"". A better value (objective) would be a car with similar or better attributes at a lower price. A better choice (subjective) is what works for you. Or me.IMO, the TL-S and IS350 are much more directly comparable than either of those are to the 335i. But even that's IMO and I know some that would claim the IS shouldn't even be in this list because it can't seat 4 full size adults comfortably. So everybody has their priorities. I just think the term ""better value"" is being overused in this forum.P.S. In the early 1990's, friends of ours (both lawyers) chose to buy a bigger house in a high end Baltimore neighborhood for $425k instead of a smaller house in a high end DC neighborhood for $650k. They justified it repeatedly as ""You get a better value in Baltimore"". Today, their Baltimore house is worth $800k and the one in DC would go for $2+ million.

If we can't compare 2 cars from the same class as ""apples to apples"" then what else can we accomplish here?IMO, the TL-S and IS350 are much more directly comparabAccording to your logic, one is FWD and another is RWD, end of comparison here. On the other hand TL-S offers manual tranny but because it's FWD so not comparable to the Bimmer. Now my question is, what exactly is TL's role here? Maybe it's time to remove all none-RWD and none-automtic entries here and let 3er, G35, IS250 and CTS fight it out. Oh BTW yeah, because of the lack of power, let's remove the IS250 as well... "

I got caught up in the TL hub bub and the ""deal"" but in the end I made a bad mistake and bought a car that is uninspiring and bland. I assume that is how some BMW owners feel about the G35 as well and I respect that. My two cents. "

You bought 18"" tires on a non-sport suspensioned, slushbox IS350 because they were ""must haves"" from an aesthetic standpoint. You are admittedly not a ""driving enthusiast"". The only time I find the TL's FWD to be a detriment is in spirited driving. But I would find the IS slushbox a detriment all the time. I think the automatic TL and IS350 are more comparable because both emphasize ""L"" more than ""P"" in terms of gadgets, electronics and appointments and offer Japnaese ""no-fuss"" reliability. To clarify: I'm not saying that any of these cars can't be compared to one another for features attirbutes and price. But at least three straight posts following your response credit one car or another with being the ""better value"" as if that is an objective metric that everyone should be able to agree on.

"louiswei","January 2007"," Let's make this clear...The person you described above sounds like he/she will be really happy in a Buick LaSabre. However, that is not me.I am definitely not a driving enthusiast because 1. I don't track my car, 2. don't drive like I stole it and 3. I enjoy the comfort my car's interior has to offer as well as its driving dynamics. That being said, it doesn't mean that I can't tell a different between FWD & RWD. One doesn't need to push the car to the limits in order to notice a difference. An average driver (okay, maybe a little above average) can tell a FWD/RWD from the first turn out of the parking lot.Since you kept bringing out the 18"" tire + none-sport suspension + automatic, let's get it over with once for all.18"": I like my car to look sharp, maybe you don't care much as how your car looks but I do. IMO, 18"" looks better than 17"". Also, have you seen any RWD IS with the 17"" wheels? I doubt it. Because guess what they don't build it like that. Although the 17"" is standard and 18"" is option but almost every RWD IS shipped to the Southeast has 18"" on them. So far haven't heard about the 18"" causes problems on the IS yet.None-sport suspension: Comparing to my old Honda Accord, the IS' suspension is ""sport"" enough. I really don't need a suspension that's any stiffer. As I said before, since I don't track my car, don't drive like crazy and there are no mountain roads around me, I just don't see the point to drop $4K on the relatively useless (to me of course) sport suspension.Automatic: Manual is definitely more fun to drive, I know this due to my experience with the manual 3000GT and BoxterS. However, as this is currently my only car I think automatic is more practical. Especially when I was tired from a day's work and stuck in traffic, I would rather just listen to music, relax and not have to utilize my hand and feet that much. When it's time to purchase my second (weekend fun) car, the current top choice is Corvette Z06 with manual transmission.Bottom line: I view the ELLPS as a fancier commuter box which is practical enough for everyday driving. When times come and I am searching for some serious fun and sport I'll be looking at someplace else. "

The IS 350 blew the competition away when it first came out w/ the amount of raw power it offered and everyone chuckled at the IS owners about straight line performance.Having driven an IS350, I can say straight it went like a bat out of hades. But once you came to a corner you were confronted with lousy roadfeel, a yacht-like suspension and poor chassis performance. That still stands. On a track the IS350 would quickly fall to the e46 ZHP, 06 e90 ZSP, any G35 and probably most TLs and A4s. Guess what- Infiniti and BMW responded because they recognized the obvious hp threat from Lexus.No, they realized americans aren't too bright. We see a big hp number and think a car is good - hence the success of piggy cars like the 300C. So BMW and Infiniti offer ""on-paper"" HP comparable to an IS350 but of course the driving dynamics of the two far outshine the IS.Now your telling me that your gloating over the amount of hp the 335i has??

Then the first corners come. Uh-oh, it takes the corners faster than the IS350. By the end of a track run with the same driver you'd get times that are decidedly in favor of the BMW. Before you'd win out because you'd still take the twisties faster than the waffling IS can handle. Essentially, the car's the complete package. No matter what Lexus does to the IS in terms of HP - like the silly IS-F - the car will still be saddled with poor steering, poor roadfeel, junky tranny and a lousy chassis. "

I really wanted to like the G35, since I was coming out of a 1995 Nissan Maxima SE that gave me 150k trouble free miles. The G35 was a dissapointment. Power was comparable to the TL, but the engine was rougher under hard acceleration. Even more so than my 9 year old Maxima. I also thought I'd prefer the G35's RWD setup, but it didn't handle appreciably better than the TL, it's steering was more vague. The gershift was the biggest dissapointement - well behind the snick-snick shifting of both the 330i and TL 6-speeds. I understand the new G35 has a lot of cosmetic improvemetns. I hope they also addressed my mechanical concerns. It wasn't a bad car - not a ""dog"" - but just very rough around the edges. P.S. I hope you aren't going to tell me that any of the cars you had or are considering are automatics. If they are, you have no standing to call anything a dog.  "
"ggesq","January 2007"," ""We mention it because in a straightline the 335i takes the IS350.""That's exactly my point. When the IS350 first came out it set the ""benchmark"" for hp in this class and ""driving enthusiasts"" heckled Lexus fans about straightline performance.Since then, BMW (& Infiniti) caught on that- hey- maybe we will lose market share since not every 3 series buyer/lessee tracks their car or drives like an 18 y.o.Now, BMW is back on top leading the hp war (IMHO) and 3er fans are drooling over themselves not only because of the bragging rights but also because it is a viable alternative to the current M3.That said, I'm a TL owner with hopes that Acura will become competitive in the market again and offer something with equivalent hp and torque.Not everyone buys these cars for what you and other ""enthusiasts"" buy/lease them for.

Back then there was no Mazdaspeed 6. So how could it have been included in the original list of possible ELLPS cars?I'll assume that the list has not changed since that first post back in 2002. And, if that is the case, I understand why the MazdaSpeed 6 cannot be included since it has only been available to buyers for 3 years, and not back to March of 2002.However, if this discussion has evolved to include other cars also not available in March of 2002, then I cannot understand why the Speed 6 is not a contender since it objectively possesses the luxury, performance, size and MSRP to qualify as an ELLPS. Except for that luxury nameplate / subjective snob appeal thing, it surely should be.That is not necessarily a bad thing, snob appeal. So why deny it is the deciding factor? "
"louiswei","January 2007"," I'll assume that the list has not changed since that first post back in 2002Dude, look at the list closer again this time.

"habitat1","January 2007"," Give it up, Joe.Mazda does not belong here because, unfortunately, no matter how well you personally think the Speed 6 stacks up against a 335i and IS350 on paper, hardly anybody in the car buying public would consider it remotely close to the same league as the other ELLPS here. That's based upon everything from brand image to build quality to fit and finish, to style, to overall performance / driving dynamics to resale value. I would put Mazda ahead of Kia and Hyundai (barely), but behind Nissan and VW and way, way, way behind Toyota and Honda. And none of those other brands are being considered in this ELLPS forum, either.If you don't believe me, just look at 3-4 year old Mazda resale values. They are horrific compared to the ELLPS brands, as well as Honda and Toyota. They are barely above Ford, which is to say, barely above ""abysmal"". That alone should tell you all you need to know why it doesn't qualify. "

"tpjcourtney","January 2007"," a Mazdaspeed 6 to reply to this thread? I have to tell you that it is hard for me to believe there is a better sedan in this segment right now than my 335i. I do wish there wasn't 6-8"" of snow on the ground here now so I could enjoy it, but I probably would be out driving if there wasn't.Living at 6000ft, I can not believe the power of this car as compared to my old 98 M3 sedan. In top gear the car has good pull from as low as 35-40 mph. I am still in the breakin period, so no full throttle test, but it has been hard to keep it under 4500rpm. I am really happy with the clutch effort, very light and easy to drive smoothly. I did order a shorter BMW shift knob, as I felt the original was a bit tall. Being a little more than 1"" shorter made a welcome difference. Steering is well weighted on my spt pkg equiped car and the steering wheel is the best I've ever had my hands on. Good diameter, very thick rim, slightly tacky leather and thumb rests at 10 & 2.The sport seats, mine in Lemon Leather, are incredible. The things I really like about these are the extendable thigh support which I had on the M3, and the power adjustable back bolsters. As an autoxer and sometimes track attendee, it is nice to have seats that can go from comfortably holding you in to agressive track seats at the push of a button. At 6'2"", I really wish more cars had adjustable thigh support.The couple minor things to complain about for me are...1. I have polarized sunglasses and I can't read the radio display with them on. Kind of irritating, but I can lift my chin and look under the glasses to see. I will say that the 13 speaker, Logic 7 system does an excellent job of drowning out any negitive thoughts I have about the stereo.2. The lack of LSD will probably be a challenge at the track/autox. Trying to put down 300hp & 300ft/lb on a tight turn with all the traction control gizmos off will probably have me burning a little more rubber than I like. "

"shouldiwait","January 2007"," You are a little misinformed. It seems quite proper to compare one sports sedan to another, same category and class seems fair to me. You are biased when you thought your TL was faster and handles better than the Type S. The latter has more horsepower and has a revised and improved suspension. I had an S2000 and yet I thought this Type S handles quite well. As far as it feeling slower than your TL, you must allow a car to break in a little to feel the added power- perhaps after 5 or so thousand miles. In addition, I think you felt restraint from pushing when you test drove it and I am sure you did not use the paddle shift sport mode.Regarding the FWD and RWD comparison, the latter generally handles much better. However, you need to read the upcoming Road and Track magazine on the IS350, Type S and the new G comparison. The Type S actually did very well.My main point is about what you get for driving experience/pleasure and money. I am very happy with my decision. I still own the 2000 BMW and I would not buy another BMW from a financial standpoint. I am a lawyer and can easily afford a 335 but logic tends to dictate my decision. "

"plekto","January 2007"," 3 - you can push-start a manual in an emergency.4 - you can tow a manual easily.5 - a failing transmission will give you months of warning as opposed to *blocks*. Automatics literally can fail in the space of half a mile. Then it's a rock. The manual can be shifted carefully without a clutch AT ALL, in fact - if you know the gearing and shift points. And most cars can be driven to the shop just fine in 2nd gear.6 - you drive the car instead of it driving you. Case in point - a downhill sweeping curve. The automatic will upshift while you can keep it in third to power up the hill in a few hundred feet after the turn(typical of many mountain roads)7 - better gearing ratios. Zero lag-time to spool up to the proper speed for quick transitions.8 - the ability to get by with a lot smaller engine. Better mpg and less weight.And, yes, it's tons cheaper to fix. $350-500 plus labor will get you a racing clutch put in most cars. A typical clutch job runs about 500-600, so $1000 is a BMW or something overkill for most cars.The only two things you gain fom an automatic are:1 - idiot-proofing - anyone can drive it. (also, there's no physical or mental reason a woman can't learn as well as a man how to use a manual)2 - not having to shift in a traffic-jam. Note - I counted - two traffic jams on Friday here in L.A. I shifted 4 times in the first one and 6 times in the second. They both covered more than ten miles. I just planned and kept my speed at where I didn't need to shift endlessly. The idea that you need to shift 50+ times... someone's been feeding you a line. "

I'm not sure why he thinks so. "
"habitat1","January 2007"," You are biased when you thought your TL was faster and handles better than the Type S.I think you are the one that might be a little biased. The 2004 TL 6-speed which I have included as standard equipment a stiffer sport suspension than the automatic, the same Brembo brakes that are now on the TL-S and optional (which I have) high performance summer tires. It is my understanding that the previous TL 6-speed suspension was softened slightly for the current TL-S. Perhaps it is ""improved"" for comfort, but definitely not handling. I stand behind my claim that my 2004 TL 6-spped handles as well or better than the current TL-S, especially one with all season tires, albeit there isn't that much of a difference. If you want to claim that the TL-S is a little quieter and more comfortable over rough roads, I'll concede that.Regarding speed, I didn't take out a stopwatch, but as best I could tell, the horsepower increase of about 10% is MORE than completely offset, in my opinion, of going from a 6-speed to slightly heavier automatic with it's resulting drivetrain loss. And yes, I did try the paddle shifters. The TL-S automatic is just that, an automatic, torque converter and all. The paddle shifters do nothing to make up for the fact that the torque converter eats power and is slower than a manual transmission to fully engage. If Acura had put a BMW style SMG or Audi style DSG instead of an automatic, the end result would likely be different.I concede that the TL-S 6-speed would be quicker than the former TL 6-speed, since it does have 28 more horsepower. You mentioned one thing I am very curious about. As a former S2000 owner myself, I was very pleased with the TL 6-speeds gearbox having some of the same precision and feel as the S2000's short throw 6-speed. Why in the world did you get a TL-S automatic after having owned an S2000? "
"circlew","January 2007"," dafreak1,Good luck in advance.

Get it if you want the ultimate seats and a real performance. You can stretch the options in a lease also.Regards,OW "

"goodegg","January 2007"," Where does leasing provide any more of a tax benefit over owning? Especially in the first few years of use. Ownership also affords one better flexibility to get out of the car when they want, how they want, and to whom they want. If you're gonna only drive 10,000 a year or less and want a new car every 3-4 years, then yes, lease.I think the included maintenance for a BMW is a big selling point. But isn't that offered to those who buy instead of lease as well? "
"blueguydotcom","January 2007"," Leasing, if you own a business you write off the entire payment, Ownership and resale after 3 years (is he financing or buying outright)? is just flat out silly. BMW supports their leases in a big way. Included maintenance is for EVERY BMW. Leasing is the same as buying as far as BMW corporate is concerned. BMWFS leases the car, just as BMWFS buys the car and loans the customer the cash. Do some spreadsheets guys. Buying a brand new car off the lot and reselling 3 years later = burning money. You're paying full TTL on a purchase and for those first two years - even if you pay cash - you're so in the negative equity that car's a weight around your neck. Buy a 40k BMW (44k down then) and the moment you drive off the lot you're immediately out 7-8k. Buy and hold for 6 years - that pays off. Buy and resell in 3 years...silly. "

Also no money down, flexibility to get out of the contract easily and quickly without taking a bath.You pay full tax title and tags on a lease contract also. And being locked into a lease is as much 'weight around your neck' as having the negative equity, which is minimal if you buy a car that has excellent resale.For a business yes, lease the vehicle. For personal use there are a lot of advantages to owning the car instead of just renting it if you're gonna keep it at least 4 - 5 years. I've done both.

When BMW runs leases with inflated residuals (mid 70s on 2 year leases) and super low MFs (less than a percent equivalent) you end up with stupid cheap leases. Consider ED is usually 85% of MSRP and a 75% residual means you're only paying for 10% of the car's value (figure 5-6k). Finally add, in the 1k on the BMWCCA rebate and you'll see leases for under $400. Hard to believe but people get them. "

We live in DC and until our 2005 MDX, neither my wife nor I ever owned an automatic (combined ages of close to 100). My wife likes a manual not because she drives like Danika Patrick. She just likes the feeling of direct control and no unexpected upshifts or downshifts. The XC90 V8 we also considered had an automatic with a mind of its own. Her first choice would have been the X5 3.0 6-speed, but it was too small. We came out of a 1996 Isuzu Trooper 5-speed which she put 80,000 miles on.

"shipo","January 2007"," ""They have to soften them up to accomodate the low-profile tires.""I read a study three or four years back that tested a couple of different cars with wheel/tire sets ranging from 16"" through 20"" (all with the same rolling diameter as the factory spec for the car, and all roughly the size of a typical 3-Series BMW wheel/tire) to see if they could quantify the better handling aspects of larger wheels and lower profile tires. IIRC, the rather surprising result was that 17"" was deterined to be the optimal size, and beyond that, the extra unsprung weight started negatively affecting the handling characteristics.I have no idea if suspension tuning combined with light weight wheels (expensive) and tires will offset the findings of the study that I read, but there it is. Best Regards,Shipo "
"designman","January 2007"," IIRC, the rather surprising result was that 17"" was determined to be the optimal size...Yes, that's also what I've heard from the track rats and the E46 3-series. If you really want a good feel for what has become of this, try a 996 911 with 17s, then a 997 911 that is bling laden with 19s, both with and without the electronic damping they call PASM. I don't think BMW has gone to that extreme yet with the suspension and I think I would choose the smallest wheel I could get on a E90/92 3-series... without runflats of course.

A few rides and drives in that 996 Turbo required a trip to the dentist to have my fillings reset. That said, I would agree with the general comment that many, if not most, manufacturers have not advanced their suspensions to the same degree they have increased their wheel size. The former involves real engineering, the latter appeals to image over substance. In the ELLPS segment, only BMW, in my opinion, has the suspension to match anything larger than 17"" wheels.P.S.

"habitat1","January 2007"," ""There must be some really lazy typists around.""Lazy? How many IS350 (or TL, or G35, or...) purchasers even bothered to do what blueguy did in getting an actual estimate of maintenance costs over 4 years and 50k miles before making a (supposedly) informed purchase decision. And how many have taken it the next step and estimated resale values over the time they expect to own the car?Virtually everybody here in this forum that has claimed the IS, G, or TL are cheaper than the 335i by XX,XXX dollars based their figure on nothing but the up front purchase price. Talk about LAZY ... and imprudent. I am virtually certain for a 4 year ownership period, the 335i is less expensive than the G35, if you consider maintenance, gas and resale. So if you don't like the idea of calling BMW's program ""free"" maintenance, perhaps yourcould provide us the complete list of maintenance costs for all of the other ELLPS models so we can compare apples to appples with maintenance included for all?

"keitha3","January 2007"," I too question the reasoning behind taking the cars to the dealers for scheduled maintenance. When I look at what they do for $300-400, it just doesn't add up. Local independent mechanics in my area laugh at the prices being charged. They usually do the same work for somewhere in the area of $100. I'm lucky with my Accord and will continue to be lucky if I end up with an Acura. Two of the chief mechanics for our local Honda dealership left to open their own garage for reasons including what they considered overpricing by dealerships. They do better work and for a fraction of the cost, but only work on Acuras and Hondas. For years, though, we took all of our other vehicles to a local garage where they saved us literally thousands off of dealership prices. "
"m1miata","January 2007"," What could they possibly due to your Acura at 30K miles that was worth $400? Cars pretty much tune by computer. You get an oil change, and check fluid levels, I would say. Sometimes I change the air filter at around 30K to 35K miles = a few bucks. I think people just love to spend money. As for tires, the Tire Rack or Costco have about the lowest prices these days, though I am sure there are many other discount places. With good tires from Kumho, great Yokohama tires, and many-many great choices at lower prices, I am thinking people hung up on the couple to three big name companies are paying more for less tire. This is not to say Michelins can not be bought with discounts from say Costco. For quite tires, my Dad's Toyo tires are amazingly quiet. And then they make the Ts-1 for handling.

I&#146;ve never had any issues with warranty repairs. I guess silly is as silly does. So you think it's silly to do recommended dealer maintenance, but not to buy 7 (or more) new cars in 8 years and spend a lot on depreciation. I would probably take the other side of that coin.I stretched to buy a new 1995 Nissan Maxima SE in September 1994. Fortunately, I bought form one of the few good, honest Nissan dealers in the DC area. I did do my own oil/filter changes every 4,000 miles, but I also did the 7,500 service intervals by the book, sometimes skipping to the 15k interval if I had been doing mostly highway driving. Having the tires rotated, brakes checked, fluids (transmission, brake etc) changed regularly at the dealership probably cost me a little more than Joe mechanci would have charged. But that car gave me 11 good years and 152k miles before it was retired to our second home. It still runs perfect and now has 156k miles. Original clutch, brake pads lasted 90k in front, 110k in rear, no rotor repairs or replacements ever, etc. The service manager took as much pride in servicing that car as I did in owning it.I have no doubt that one can save a few maintenance bucks going with an independent mechanic or, in your case, simply buying new cars every year or so. But I decided in 1994 that I wanted the option of getting 150k miles out of my investment. And doing the preventive maintenance seemed to help me succeed. P.S. And the ""lots of $$"" I saved on depreciation over those 11+ years by not buying a new car every spring allowed me the luxury of buying a new 911S Cab in 2005.

The classy Honda, again with FWD, if you live in snow country, or in some other way have that preference, it seems pretty good. And then there is Volvo and Audi FWD. My absolute last choice would be the Lexus ES 350 which is too close to being a Camry. Camry is fine and with a V6 starts at $24K.

I think AWD at a 100-300+lb disadvantage is NOT a good tradeoff in a sports car or sports sedan.But your claim that 50 lbs makes a ""big difference"" in the handling and road feel of a 3,500+ lb sport sedan is taking the point to the extreme. Not on any public roads, and probably not on a track. If it did, the car couldn't even make it around a corner loaded with 4 passengers. As far as noticing 10 lbs in the trunk, double bull. Unless you have that bag bouncing around in .8g slalom turns, and hear it, there isn't a human being on earth that could tell it's there. The fuel tank in my 911 holds 16.8 gallons = 135 +/- lbs. I can tell the difference between full and empty, but not between 9/16 and 5/8. Crap, I've lost 8 pounds since the holidays and looking to drop another 20.

Perhaps your post is attempted justification for you and your fiance to drive around naked, but I don't really think you have science or engineering on your side. P.S. The lighter is better principle is one I fully agree with.

Could we agree that (1) You'll begrudgingly accept that ""leather"" isn't the holy grail of ""luxury"" and (2) I'll begrudgingly accept that Cadillac and Lincoln are accepted here as luxury brands even though their very best offerings are two rungs down from anything I'd ever be seen dead in. Or alive in. If you think leather makes up for inferior build quality, exterior and interior designs that make most ELLPS buyers cringe, fit and finish that's marginal at best, and resale values that look like falling meteors...well that's your perogative. But I'd take a leatherette BMW (or 911, for that matter) over all of the dead cows in the world stuffed into a GM or Ford. "
"designman","January 2007"," Why is BMW, a recognized luxury car when they still offer standard Vinyl Seats ? I think it's just a matter of keeping MSRP as low as possible, then zapping you with the options. When people hear leatherette, the knee jerk response is e-e-w-w-w-w. And if you mention leatherette to the sales people, they intimidate you with resale etc. Buyers will spend years trying to figure out how save money when getting a new car, but mention the L word and you get a catatonic stare. The thinking is that leatherette is tantamount to being castrated. You have to admit, the tactic works. ""Show me the MONEY!"" ;-) "
"robbieg","January 2007"," I have a friend who has a 2001 325i with black leatherette and it looks like leather. "
"qbrozen","January 2007"," i feel the same way. Its really tough to tell these days unless they are side by side, IMHO. 99% of observers who were shown a leatherette bmw first would not know its not real leather. "
"fedlawman","January 2007"," Most of the cars in this segment are ""leather trimmed"" anyways, meaning only the part of the seat that touches your backside is actual leather. 80% of the interior is leatherette.Personally, I can't tell the difference and I've heard BMW pleather is more durable and easier to care for than the real stuff.If and when I ever buy a new BMW, it will have pleather. "
"habitat1","January 2007"," Porsche puts leather on the sides (bolsters), leatherette in the center sections of their seats as their standard seats. My 911 came with the $1,500 ""full leather seating surfaces"" option, but I never would have ordered it. My butt would be just as happy either way. "
"plekto","January 2007"," I meant Nissan(Infinity) instead of Mitsubishi. "
"brightness04","January 2007"," I thought the primary advantage of leather over leatherette is ""permeability."" Leather ""breathes"" whereas pleather does not. Therefore a sweaty butt is best at telling the difference :-) To be honest, with the leather industry so nortorious for ""bonded leather,"" which is minced up leather pulp with polymer added (as bonding agent, i.e. glue), a product analogous to fiber board in the building industry, it's hard to tell what can be called ""real leather."" When I look at most car interiors, how flawless the large swaths of the interior ""leather"" look, it's hard to imagine where they found so many cows handled with kid gloves all their lives. Real cow hides have scars and blemishes. Cattles are pretty dumb animals that injure themselves quite often, not to mention the skin folds and strech marks from larding up on good days. None of it is visible in ""leather interior"" . . . makes one wonder :-) "

"joe131","January 2007"," some leather in cars, maybe most of it is actually painted with plastic paint. Any breathing quality of the leather in that case is compromised or lost. Sitting on plastic seat material or on plastic coated leather? What's the big difference?It is like the fake wood on the dash compared to real wood on the dash which has had layers of plastic varnish sprayed on it and polished to a plastic like surface. Wood made to imitate plastic. Haha.I suppose leather has more of a heat insulation factor which might make it comfortable sooner after entering a car than vinyl seats, that is, when your butt is at a temperature much different from the seat cushions "
"cdnpinhead","January 2007"," Excellent. I hadn't thought about it that way, but you're certainly correct.I do appreciate how leather smells, but I'm guessing (as was pointed out, with respect to ""wood"") that, at this price point, real leather & real wood are well out of reach -- what we get is a pale imitation. Surprisingly (or not), that's adequate, most of the time, to keep the cars selling.When Infiniti presented a real (non-shiny) wood finish in their M series, many didn't like it. It appears that plastic has carried the day.You get what you pay for (plus that negotiation bit). "
"plekto","January 2007"," Go to a Mercedes dealership and sit in the S class coupes. That's real leather. It's thick, soft, and 100% real. And it feels exactly like a leather couch or a good leather jacket.The other just is the pressedboard crud - Ford is famous fo this as witnessed by the 4-5 year lifespan of their ""Leather"" interiors.(when you see it coming apart and you see white backing, that's the stuff that's put together like particle-board. Real leather is solid and if you get a rip in it, it's all the way through the same, like say, ripping a cotton T-shirt.But the real stuff costs about 800-1200 per car in actual labor and materials - before profit and such is factored in. MOst people don't want to spend $2000-$3000 for real leather these days(though Cadillacs should at least offer the option to those who want it) "
"nkeen","January 2007"," Not popular in the US market, but cloth seats have real advantages. They'd been used elsewhere, but I first saw them on Citroen DS21s in France as a child -- what an advanced company that was thirty five or forty years ago! The DS21s looked great on the autoroutes, pneumatic suspension fully lowered, cruising at 80 to 90 mph. France at her best.In the UK, E90s appear to be sold with cloth, cloth/leather combinations and leather, but no leatherette. "

"rockylee","January 2007"," habitat1,I want to rephrase myself. I understand what you are saying but their is more to a ELLPS than just driving dynamics. IMHO that's all that BMW knows how to do very well and they sell many for that reason along with people seeking to buy for the badge. I however think theirs much more to car than strictly handling performance. Honestly how many people are going to take their BMW's to the track and use all that handling performance ???? Are you going to race louiswei, around a track in his IS350 ????? I personaly would rather enjoy the creature comforts of a IS350 that has 90-95% of the 335i's performance every day than have a car that is a great performance machine but does nothing else better than the competition let alone better than the gadget filled IS 350. If you want a performance machine their are better alternatives on the market which are cheaper to own and operate. A couple off the top of my head is the STI and EVO if you wanted to stick with a sedan. The next EVO, like I said is IMHO a ELLPS even though this board and host doesn't recognize it as such because it's not a luxury brand and that's okay.  I personally think the best ELLPS on the market with price not being a factor is the Lexus IS 350. Obviously, that will change come this summer with the new 08' Cadillac CTS which should be the best but we won't know for sure until all tests have been validated. #2 should be the IS 350 #3 is a toss up between the 335i or G35 based on if no chages are made. I know the car mags don't agree with me because they are gear heads but I'm factoring everyday use as a daily driver and can't knock louiswei's decision one bit for wanting to own the best ELLPS on the market IMHO.

"blueguydotcom","January 2007"," Rocky, Do you derive any pleasure from driving? I do. I look forward to driving. It's not a chore. It's not a have-to. It's a desire, a longing, almost an addiction. Coupled with that need is a strange desire to always draw the perfect line on a corner. It could be a simple 90 degree turn or a banked 270 degree corner that I take daily. The line, carrying speed through it, transitioning the weight just right, nose pointing in the perfect place for exit. I get ultimate glee from the ""perfect corner"" or taking a series of Esses just right. Unfortunately, lifestyle demands a 4 door with room at least a little room. I demand xenon headlights, leather and some sense that the car i'm in wasn't built for someone working at target (Subaru, Mitsubishi) That's why I drive a BMW. The only other guys who come close are Mazda - not the Mazdaspeed6. VW is a distant third. Everyday, I drive my car. how it handles is of the utmost importance. You seem to prefer passively piloting. to each his own. Most people drive like they're dead; if I drove like them I might as well have a banal auto-equipped 03 Camry 4 cylinder then. "

No need to push the absolute limits of the car but enjoying the experience and the skill to do it well (a little like golf; you're really competing with yourself).I enjoyed the 2 BMW coupes I've had but practicality dictates a 4 door (2007 Acura TL-S) and FWD for Northeast winters (though this year has been an exception).Using enjoyment and enthusiastic (but not dangerous) driving as an evaluation mechanism allows for a lot of individual choice in ELLPS (among the agreed brands). Many of the cars would be good choices but personal preferences, price, etc., make the equation different for everyone.Enjoy your daily drives; I certainly do. Jack "

IMHO that's all that BMW knows how to do very well and they sell many for that reason along with people seeking to buy for the badge.""Quality driving dynamics and precision engineering are infinitely more important to me than the difference between BMW leatherette and Cadillac leather. As for ""that's all BMW knows how to do""? What planet are you living on Rocky? BMW's can be equiped with virtually all of the luxury amenities a normal person could ever want. And style is highly subjective. As for those seeking to buy the ""badge"", let's cut to the chase on that one. GM lovers should be envious of the BMW badge. Better yet, they should learn from it. It represents more than a half century of dedicated commitment to producing some of the finest engineered cars in the world. As, by the way, does the Porsche badge. BMW earned the right to ""badge"" loyalty. GM, on the other hand, did everything possible to piss that kind of quality engineering heritage and customer loyalty in the gutter. You yourself can't proudly live in the present. You are always promoting that the next thing to come out of Cadillac will be ""the best"". Wishful thinking - but one thing is for certain, brand loyalty doesn't work that way. If you've screwed up for a couple of decades straight, you either need to fold your tent or be prepared to do it right for a consistent decade or two before arrogantly thinking that you deserve any brand loyalty. That's how long it took Audi to overcome their debacles in the 1980's. Lastly, please don't speak for me, Louiswei, blueguydotcom or anyone else in this forum when you attempt to proclaim the ""top three"" ELLPS's. That's your opinion, which you are entitled to have, (despite, IMO, your warped metrics of ""gadgets"" being king). I think most of us here are mature and intelligent enough to come to our own opinions and conclusions without the benefit of your ""obvious"" proclamation that the next Cadillac will, finally, be ""the best"".

"circlew","January 2007"," Listen, I was a GM loyalist, switched to Lincoln and finally gave up after many decades. First GM in my family was a '56 Chevy Belair. I agree with habitat regarding the ""toilet"" treatment and arrogance regarding any need to change to market dynamics or to recognize the reaction from customers as their products suffered from real and perceived quality/value degradation. That was/is the mentality of some of the large car manufacturers today as well (Merc, Watch Out!...don't get Chrysler fungus). Bleeding quality and loyalty led to the current state of affairs for the US contingent. Yes, they can and will turn around because they can no longer exist by the ""driving by looking in the rearview mirror"" mentality. The past is gone. The competition is better. Time to get real.Heck, if my GM car performed close to this BMW I own, you think I would not line up again and again?

Some of the more busy looking cars, with some odd lines and creases in the body works kinda remind me more of some odd things from Japan and Korea over the years. Or perhaps some of the very strange things out of Detroit. While some may find the CTS a bit much, as in too radical, you have to admit it is sharp, and will be something in a car museum and car shows within a couple decades. While it is a bit alarming at first, this Art & Science look, it doesn't come off to me as off balanced as say the Bangle butt on a 7 series BMW. The less radical forms of the Bangle are kinda interesting. On some models of BMW it is starting to look OK. All in all though the appearance of some German cars is starting to blend now with the Japan makes. And I hope the headlamp craze gets toned down some day before they overtake the whole car. Some day the size of the lens will exceed the hood width! And some are long too --- too long!OK, a quick stupid question: Do you prefer the look of the Azera to the Sonata?

Stop fantasizing and pull out your financial calculator.I was an original owner of one of the roughly 460 BMW M1's produced in the late 1970's. Paid the godly sum of $65,000+/- in 1979. Decided to sell in 1982. My brother said I was nuts, that I should keep the car and it would go up in value. Indeed it did, and if I had taken the time to properly store it in a climate and humidity controlled environment, I could probably get $125,000 for it today, maybe even $200,000 from a crazy collector with more money than brains.The $55,000 I sold it for in 1982 went into a conservative investment fund. My wife and I were just getting married and we agreed that, assuming we didn't need to use the money for a house, kids, etc., I could ""splurge"" some day on another sports car. Fortunately, we've done pretty well and I've been able to have my cake and eat it too. But we kept that money sequestered from our other funds and the conservative investment has returned an average of 14.5% annually. Not exactly hedge fund type returns, but enough to grow that $55,000 into $1,432,000+/- (pre-tax) as of December 31. I cringe when I hear of people speaking of cars as investments. Yes, there are some collectables in which you could do pretty well if you were at the right place, at the right time, and knew exactly what was a good deal or not.

I too might have suggested a third or fourth alternative that required hardly any spilling of blood whatsoever, but if those are the only choices, I'd vote for Mercedes. I know a lot more people that have eeked 130k miles out of Mercedes than Volvos without getting nickle and dimed (or dollared) to death. And they look better in the process. But with either one, I'd be tempted to get an extended warranty.

"fedlawman","January 2007"," Only the new Volvo's have Ford DNA in them (mostly it's Ford's borrowing from Volvo DNA).The S60 is a 5 or 6 year old platform (MY2001 I think) so that argument is moot. I also don't buy into the whole reliability argument. Maybe the Japanese cars have a very slight edge in ""predicted reliability"" over the long haul, but all new cars today are pretty darn reliable. In all likelihood, a new Volvo or Mercedes, if properly maintained, will make just as fine a 10 year old car as a Honda or Toyota.I work for a federal government agency, and we have a fleet of about 60 American cars assigned out to us. We keep all of these Dodge pickups, Ford Explorers & Tauruses, Chevy Luminas & Blazers, etc. for 7-8 years and 100,000 miles. In the 13 years I've worked for the feds, I've never seen a single car go out of service due to catastrophic mechanical failure - and we drive these cars hard. I've had more than a dozen cars assigned to me over the years, and I've never had a major breakdown. In fact, after I surplussed my M-B S420 last fall, I was assigned a beautiful '99 Ford Taurus. I've had it since July and so far, it's tight as a drum and trouble free.I'm certain that a Mercedes or Volvo, driven normally and maintained properly, will provide years of reliable, comfortable service. Don't get sucked in by all the anecdotal hype you read here and elsewhere. Cars are machines designed and built by humans. No car is perfect, and any car can have it's share of problems. Buy the one you like best and enjoy it. "

For you, you deserve a car that makes you feel good. FWIW, I had a 2001 Volvo V70 wagon (purchased CPO in 2003 with 23,000 miles on the odo). The car was totaled after my wife was struck head-on by a van going 40 MPH. We didn't give it a second thought - replaced it with a new 2004 V70.

"goddess_1","January 2007"," If I told what else was important to me in a car, you'd roll your eyes! :surprise: Since I feel like I nearly live in my car, I am looking for some serious creature comforts. Hey, I'm worth it. And, safety is a must -- I swear, it's like other drivers are AIMING for me!As far as FWD or AWD goes, I'm sticking with FWD -- where I live, AWD is completely unnecessary in terms of use, and hence, expense. Rain? Snow? Forget it! (No offense to you ski lovers.)HP, RPMs & torque are not my thing -- I expect to step on the gas and move along . . . not at a turtle's pace (my lead foot will take of that), but my ego isn't attached to my 0-60 time, either. If it was, I definitely would not be considering either of these vehicles! That's a major reason I won't go for a BMW -- it may be fast, but the ride is too rigid & uncomfortable for my tastes - I prefer to float along at the cost of some oomph & handling performance. As for the pricing difference (or lack thereof) - I guess it comes down to the C280 being classed as MB's entry level vehicle, and the S60 as Volvo's mid-level class. In truth, the C280 is ~$2.5K-3.5K more, but I don't really consider that significant at this price range (hi $20s actual value, give or take.) Other people may view it differently. I'm finding both the C280 and S60 are offered at quite inflated prices (I live in a region that lives or dies by their vehicle class.) But, if I wanted inflated, I'd buy new.  "

I doubt I'd want to trade jobs or cars with you, but as I'm slushing through the first snow of Boston while my 911 sits in the garage, I wouldn't mind trading locations for the next couple of months. There were some inconsistencies in your previous posts. I assume you know that the Mercedes is RWD, not FWD as your previous post indicated you wanted to stick with. And, from what I've seen, the C280 would run close to $40k new loaded up with ""serious creature comforts"". And you alternated from indicating you were looking at 06/07 models (new) to ""if I wanted inflated, I'd buy new"".I'm not exactly sure what you want and am hesitant to give advice, but...from a (barely) 30's something female to another, I offer two alternatives. A nice ""certified"" used low mileage 04/05 Boxster S, preferably in Speed Yellow, loaded with amenities for around $35k. It will get you better gas mileage and a boatload more smiles than the old folks cars you are considering. Or, given that that suggestion is probably already in the trash can, search around for a used, low mileage 2005 E320 CDI. They can be had in the mid to high $30's (less than a new C280). The E-class is a big step up from the C-class. More comfortable, better built, lasts longer, etc. The CDI will give you considerably better gas mileage (35+ highway), with better acceleration than the other two.I can't even pick between your choices.

"habitat1","January 2007"," Now that I think about it, I'll second redsoxgirl nomination of a used 2005 E320 CDI as a viable alternative to the new or slightly used 20007 C280.My marketing director has an E320 CDI, the sales manager that works for her has a 2004 C240. We have driven both of them to lunch together on dozens of occassions. The E320 is in a whole different league above the C class. Frankly, even with the imrpovements and revisions for the 2007 model, the C class just seems too much like a mediocre car for those that must have the Mercedes badge. It is NOT on the same playing field as the BMW 3 series, which has tremendous attributes in its own right (i.e. separate from the 5 series) as the best performing, best handling ELLPS. The C class seems like it's simply geared to those that can't afford the E class. IMO, the C class is a definite notch down from the TL. When you look at how well the E320 CDI holds its value, plus the great fuel economy and moderate maintenance requirements, it's not much more expensive, if at all, than a gussied up C280. I'd go for the real thing, especially if comfort is a primary concern. The E320CDI is silky smooth at 75-80 on the highway. The C class feels like a Toyota by comparison. Which is not bad, but not great.Try to find some ADD sellers of CDI's. "
"fedlawman","January 2007"," The V70's handling isn't ""atrocious."" I'd say it's simply ""not sporty.""It has a smooth ride that absorbs all manner of road imperfections, yet it corners with minimal roll. It leans and pushes through corners about as bad as a Honda Accord - not sporty, but not flaccid either.We love it for it's suprememly comfortable seats, airy interior, light but communicative steering, and very nice leather and wood trimmed interior. The cockpit is very driver oriented, and it's a pleasure to drive around town and on long freeway treks. Of course the safety engineering built into it goes without saying.Better tires and firmer springs/shocks would make it a sporty handler, but even stock, it's more than adequate for transporting 4 kids (+ equipment) to soccer practice or taking 2-week road trips down to California.Anyways, it's by far the most comfortable, stylish, economical (30+ MPG hwy), and sportiest vehicle that I can think of that seats 7 or hauls sheetrock with the tailgate closed. It's got plenty of passing power in the mountains - even fully loaded, and it's been as trouble free as any Honda I've ever owned - and I've owned 5 over the years.I don't think you can have your cake and eat it too. You cannot have uncompromised comfort and sport in one car. I do think that, if you're willing to compromise, the ELLPS segment is as good a compromise as any, but I tried to live with an ELLPS and I didn't like it. For me, the only solution was to own 2 cars with very distinct personalities/functions. The Volvo V70 for serene errand running/family touring, and the BMW M3 for weekend canyon carving and racetrack lapping. "

"habitat1","January 2007"," Actually, there is a pretty good case to be made that tax payers (federal income) are subsidizing all vehicles - especially SUV's - a hell of a lot more than hybrids.Consider that Arnold Schwartzenager's 10 mpg 6,000+ lb Hummers qualified for 100% accelerated tax write-offs. As does your friendly lawyer's GX470, doctor's Range Rover Sport and Tiki Barber's Escalade. Add the cost of the war in Iraq to the list of items that some say should be funded (or at least substantially so) with a federal gas tax, and we'd rip right through $3.50 a gallon on our way to $7.00. After all, you don't think we'd be willing to spend as much or sacrifice as much to promote democracy in a region that wan't sitting on trillions of barrels of oil, do you?I hate partisan ""politics"". I believe in economics and free market capitalism. Unfortunately, the average mass market Joe is going to be just as fuel efficient as his wallet requires, and the auto manufacturers need to be shown the money before they work on fuel efficiency as much as cup holder design for Tiki's behemouth. If I have to pay $7.00 per gallon to fill up the tank on my 19/26 mpg 911S or non-tax deductable, 18/23 mpg MDX, so be it. I'm paying a shipload more than that now out of my income tax to subsidize a fleet of tax deductable $60k+ 10-14 mpg SUV's.

One could conclude today that, of course, Mercedes' buyers want automatics, because anyone who wants a stick has self selected out of their customer pool. But, if I'm not mistaken, the 3-series crushes the C class in sales and the M5 beats the E55 in resale value. A friend of mine bought one of the very first E-classes around 1988 and ordered it with a manual. The dealer tried to forewarn him about resale. He responded that he'll just have to take it to a BMW dealer when he was ready to trade, down the road. :P Take care.  "

"m1miata","January 2007"," You are right, the car may indeed be more fun, and more sports car like with a manual transmission. And they are right, people do not drive sticks much in USA, so most all the sales would be in automatics. And I am sure it is a fun car to drive with the automatic. Rack and pinion steering would have helped. They offer the CTS with a stick, yet I have yet to see one on the lot. And if you bought one, it would be hard to resell. I have a stick PT right now, and I bet I take a lickin' for choosing that. The gas mileage is better, but most people do not want a stick or can not master the manual tranny.They had a waiting list for buyers of the SLK, so they made the right choice in the package, wouldn't you say? That is from a dollar stand point. One problem is going to be bad press, with only an automatic. The test drivers love to point out cars with an automatic only as being one which is not a true sports car. So what? I bet more women than men bought them, and that 90% of all buyers of a Mercedes would expect an automatic. Now a Miata is a different breed.

I noted that the 911 Carrera, for example, has an MSRP of 72k, this is the base price with no options at all and has 325hp, you can get the G and the IS fully loaded for 20k less.

No sedan from any one of those makes can come close to the sheer thrill of driving a 911 nor can they match it in performance.

Marketwise very few people looking at a 911 are going to ""settle"" for a mere sedan, especially an entry-level one, no matter how brilliant they are (335i). It is really a joke to compare a Lexus of any kind to a Porsche. Infiniti won't get the GT-R and the G35 coupe is about as close to a 911 as you can get from Infiniti, and that ain't close at all.

This will change slightly when the new M3 arrives, but just as it does the 2008 911 is due to arrive with a new DSG-style tranny and an upped hp rating of 380hp standard.

"habitat1","January 2007"," You definitely win the prize for the biggest attempted ""apples vs. bananas"" comparison here. As a current owner of a Porsche (911S Cab) and an ELLPS (Acura TL 6-speed), IMO there is more ""overlap"" in Janet Jackson's past super bowl costume than there is in these two cars. And that's after the ""malfunction"".You can put all of the horsepower and gadgets in the world in an ELLPS and it's not going to give you the tight handling, visceral feel and pure fun of driving a real sports car. If anything, the fact that the 911 has a mini rear seat and, thanks to PASM and other suspension advancements doesn't jar your fillings loose like the 1985 model, means that it steals miles that otherwise would have gone to the TL (3 times as many in the last 16 months). But make no mistake, they still are miles apart in the automotive/driving spectrum.I would guess that the vast majority of Porsche buyers already have at least an ELLPS, if not an LPS, in their garage. Some with more horsepower than their Porsche. The fact that performance has improved over the years in the ELLPS segment is great. But as best I can tell, very few perspective Porsche buyers would ever say, ""thank goodness for a 500 hp Lexus, now I no longer want a 911"".And actually, this is my second time around this block. I previously owned a Nissan Maxima SE 5-speed and a Honda S2000. If Porsche and Lexus sound too snooty for you, replace the above comparisons with the Nissan and Honda. Same conclusion. "

"circlew","February 2007"," Here is a post from a Surgeon in CA with additional problems:JamesMarina, CAReply ?|Flag for ReviewMar 31, 2006I have an 05 CTS-V which had 19,450 miles on it. I am a surgeon, and I drive an enormous number of miles each week to operate at multiple Northern California hospitals.Recently, while rolling to a stop, the conroller arm FELL OFF the car, causing my front end to dig into the ground and grind to a halt. Needless to say, had I been going freeway speeds, I wouldn't be writing this right now, rather one of you would be writing my epitaph.Cadillac/GM treated this like a normal warranty repair. Apparently, a bolt that holds the control arm to the frame was not properly put together! They simply put it back together, and told me everything was all right-- and wanted me to drive it away. They claim this was a freak accident, and the car is now completely safe (despite no way of knowing whether the steering column, engine mounts, air bags, etc., are not properly assembled).You can imagine that I was not interested in getting into a 400 HP car and driving when I can't be sure the thing won't fall apart on the road. I'm selling, at a huge loss. GM would do NOTHING for me. Wouldn't buy back the car, wouldn't give me something else to drive. In fact, the local dealer was more interested in his payment for an oil change rather than the fact that this car almost killed me.To hell with Cadillac and GM.DON'T BUY THIS CAR! "
"bruceomega","February 2007"," OW,Yes, I agree with assessing total performance and not just power.I don't recall seeing any information about the design of the chassis, suspension, etc. on the 2008 CTS, or any test drives, so I'm going to wait until I form any opinions on it.ThanksBruce "

"plekto","February 2007"," A few tips for good encoding:- Get Audiograbber. It's easy to configure external plugins.- Get the latest LAME codec and install it - drop everytihng in the Audiograbber directory and restart the app.- Set the mp3 encoding to 256Kbps, maximum quality(48k), dual stereo. This results in a 8-9mb file for most music and takes a little longer to encode.(few seconds, at most). Also turn on error correction.256K is at best metal tape quality. A bit over 17Khz maximum frequency and about 1/3 the dynamic range of CD as well. But it's fine for normal listening in the car.Most MP3s are encoded at 128Kbps, average quality(44k), and joint stereo. It sounds a lot like AM Stereo - with the same bleedover from each channel and distortion.(8.5Khz top end and barely anything for dynamic range - it's worse that a typical 11Khz computer game sound)Note - if you really want to get best quality, set it to VBR 0 - which makes it go up to 320K sampling down to 128K or so for simpler passages. Sounds fantastic, but 15Meg files can be common. "

"rockylee","February 2007"," I agree with pv2 and will also add based on BMW's track record I doubt half of that technology you listed really works and BMW's reliability track record suggests that kind of car will spend most of it's time in the shop while I'm out cruising in my poor CTS. BTW cost of that car won't put it in the ELLPS segment as it would cost six-seven figures but perhaps in 3 years we will allow cars in that price segment to to be considered as a ELLPS ???? :P Rocky "
"circlew","February 2007"," Electric and Hybrid technology will obviate the engine as we know it. This will happen in all segments.

But I have at least two former business school classmates that have higher net worths than the market capitalization of Ford and GM. They are not doing well on any level of business metric. In my opinion, the future (if there is one) of American car manufacturers no longer rests with Ford or GM as we know them. It's time for a new compnay to be created by business and engineering professionals backed by private equity to develop and produce cars truly competitive with BMW, Honda and Porsche. The GM and Ford images have gotten to be far too heavy baggage, not to mention their legacy labor and management problems. "

And from the looks of it, we have a few more posters in need of remedial physics and chemistry courses than are candidates for the Nobel Prize. Attempting to first split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then recombining them to produce energy is a SIGNIFICANT net energy LOSS, as that first step is very energy inefficient. Producing hydrogen from natural gas is more efficient, but requires the burning of fossil fuels. The company, H2Gen, based in Alexandrai Virginia is one of the leaders in the development of Hydrogen fuel cell technology. If anyone cares to learn a little more google their web site. "

"rockylee","February 2007"," What ????? The CTS, doesn't fit the bill of a ELLPS car now ??? Good God. Well IMHO and others the Lincoln MKZ is here today and is a legit ""Entry-Level Luxury Perforance Sedan"" It has a V6 with 263 hp that out powers the Acura TL, it also has FWD like the Acura TL, and it also has a more sportier 6-speed automatic, where the TL just has a 5 speed. The other sporty option on the MKZ is the fact that it has a sport suspension and can be bought with AWD which improves handling. On the luxury side of the equation the MKZ, has the only ventilated seats in the segment with the exception of Lexus IS 350. The MKZ, also offers it's customers a 500 Watt THX II DVD-Audio surround sound system which is more powerful than any of the competitors. It won awards as having the best ""luxury car interior"" by wards.

"plekto","February 2007"," You have to be kidding. ""entry-level"" is exactly that - everything from 25-35K after discounts that qualifies as even a little bit of luxury and a decent amount of ""sportiness"" above a Buick/Camry/etc commuterbox. If you are talking about mainstream luxury performance cars(note the lack of ""entry-level"", then you've come to the wrong discussion. Complaining that the CTS and MKZ don't ""fit"" - they plainly do. Welcome to the bottom-end/entry-level of luxury performance cars.IIRC, based upon the original posting, this comes down to:- 25-35K after rebates - definately not $40K+, that's the next level) - has more luxury than an Accord/Camry/Pontiac/etc.- has a sporty suspension and good handling. Well, better than a Buick or Camry in any case.- manual transmission is an option.- No convertibles. 4 doos preferred - 2 okay if it's like the old 2-door Volvo sedans(it's the exact same car as a sedan, just with two doors instead of 4). No hatchbacks, crossovers, or simmilar, of course. Pretty much anything else is okay. Note the utter lack of FWD/RWD/AWD, size(within reason - a DTS isn't going to really work - lol), or brand. Traction control, stability control, navigation, alloy wheels, leather... also not on the list. Nice, but optional.A base 3 series is acceptable, for instance - the upper-end 3 probably not, though - it's just too expensive for a first time buyer in this segment to usually buy. OTOH, if BMW is running a killer financing program that get the upper-end 3 series down around the same payments as $35K... Btw, yes, the MKZ technically fits here. It's not what most of use would LIKE to see from Ford as an effort, but it passes the required minimums. "

The IS350 becomes just another luxury sedan. And it costs a lot more than $40K by the time you get it out the door. CarsDirect Price: $37,140- this is a stripped, no options base model IS350.

"rockylee","February 2007"," LOL, I'd still to this day buy the TL over everything Pontiac currently offers and that's coming from a GM guy. The G8, isn't a ELLPS because of it's badge. If you put a different emblem like a luxury nameplate badge on it then I think it has enough credibility on interior/exterior + gadgets to be a ELLPS. The G8, has the highest quality interior to ever be installed in a Pontiac car. This is all good news from GM, because it raises the bar another step higher for the comapany. While many will argue the Mercedes, has more luxury which may be true a unbiased person would be blinde to not appreciate the G8's fit and finish for a car starting out at around $26K and will top out around $33K. I do think some ELLPS buyers will cross shop the G8 because it offers a lot of value. The 2008' Cadillac CTS is a ELLPS no matter how you slice.

"plekto","February 2007"," The optimal price-point for an *entry-level* car like this should be exactly the average selling price, or $30K.- The IS 350? No stickshift. Gone. If Lexus added manual back for 2008, which given the upcoming CTS, they might, I'd gladly welcome it back. There's ZERO point in having 300HP in a smaller car like this and castrating it with a less than great automatic.- The G35 sport has manual and is right at $33K or so. It fits this discussion. It's also nicely equipped as is - you don't need $6K in options to make it a nice car.Cars Direct Target Price: $32,950- The 335i isn't BMWs entry-level offering in this category, so it fails based upon that criteria.CarsDirect Price: $38,560 - this is for one with vinyl seats and not even the upgraded suspension that you'd want - no - NEED to make it stand out from the competition.The focus needs to be on ""least expensive luxury performance sedans"" - and 40K+ isn't being frugal - or sometihng that an average first-time buyer in this segment really wants to pay. "
"pat","February 2007"," Plekto, those cars are part of this discussion and that is not going to change. If you don't want to talk about them, that's fine, just ignore them. "
"kdshapiro","February 2007"," easily top out over $40 without trying. Until recently the bottom of the line Infiniti had cloth. The Germans allow you to option out the vehicle as you want. The 3 series is the bottom of the line of BMWs lineup. Add one option to the Lexus and the price jumps by $7K. This forum is not the frugal shopping section of Edmunds.A first time buyer who wants a more sporty 2007 vehicle than a family sedan but doesn't want to pay over $30K out the door is out of luck in this segment. "
"plekto","February 2007"," The original post itself stipulated that a manual transmission as non-negotiable and it still is. Lexus needs to bring a manual option back, because to people who dominate this segment, it's not even close to the real thing without it.As for the 335i, the 330 is BMW's entry-level option according to them. If you start letting in upper-level offerings of simmilar cars, well, then we might as well put the CTS-V or the S60R in as well...P.S. while $30K may be hard to do, 30K or so for a base price before options is very much the goal of many buyers. ie - they'll squeeze up to 35K or so, but take the 335i - you can easily bloat it up to 45K or more, which is just not in the same price-range. "
"pat","February 2007"," The topic has been well-defined for quite some time. I guess there was a point where posters lost sight of the stick being a requirement. While I personally prefer a stick as do many here, there is some logic in letting it go as an absolute requirement as manual trannies become harder to find and as fewer and fewer folks (unfortunately) demand it.The CTS-V and S60R are clearly overkill for this particular conversation.I think it would be a good thing if we talked about the cars listed at the top of this page and stop worrying about what should or should not be included in this discussion that has done just fine for a very long time within its defined, yet reasonably elastic given what has changed over time, parameters.It would be great if anyone who wants to change the topic goes ahead and fires up another. We can never have too many places to debate these vehicles, eh? Edit (in response to your edit): As I've said, a five year old post defining the pricepoint needs to be taken with several inflated grains of salt. There is no reason to hold on to a five year old $40k ceiling. "
"kdshapiro","February 2007"," all of the cars only the A4 might allow you get out the door for $30K. Face it, this is a speciality segment, prices are not like the midsize family sedan segment.Why don't you start your own discussion with the makes, models and price of your choice? This way you can exclude the upper echelon of the bottom rung. "
"plekto","February 2007"," I don't see why $40K isn't just as fair a ceiling as it used to be. It keeps you firmly in ""entry-level"" territory and is exactly one notch above the typical spongy boxes/rental fleet fodder.The G35 sedan, the CTS, the S60, and 330i, and a slew of others aren't even $35K, and are fine examples of this type of car. A couple of them, like the CTS, start at under $30K. 40K is still more than enough to buy a few options and get it out the door, IMO.Most people here want to raise that limit for one and only one reason, the 335i. But that's as unfair as the IS350 is, because the IS250 is clearly what Lexus is offering as their entry-level sports sedan.And the 330i isn't a half-bad car, either, make no mistake about it. It runs neck and neck with many of the others. "
"kdshapiro","February 2007"," With options almost every vehicle goes above $40K, so you are in favor of eliminating the vehicle if it can be optioned out over $40K? Or are you just trying to twist the argument a bit. The base price of every vehicle listed is below $40K and can be optioned to over $40K.Please stop talking about the 330 you cannot buy a 2007 330 sedan or coupe. The 335i leaves 'em in the dust. "
"imidazol97","February 2007"," I read the date on Post #1 when I copied the beginning criteria to the recent post and it didn't register about cost increase. I should have realized it has changed.I used an inflation calculator and the $30000 and $40000 went to $33333 and $45000 approx. That's about 2% per year. "
"plekto","February 2007"," Yet its clear that cars get a bit less expensive every generation as well - at least in be entry-level of each segment. You can thank Hyundai and others for putting pressure on the older players.Afterall, the price increase on a base CTS isn't hardly a blip. The next one may be a little more money, but certainly not 3-4K more.I think part of it is that $40K+ still sticks in most buyers' minds as ""wait a second... that's expensive!"" - certainly to people lokoing for ""entry-level"" anything. "
"ggesq","February 2007"," Buying a 35k-45k ELLPS is not just about making the purchase. People have to factor in TCO. In reality, if folks are taking a second look at the ""price"" then they really shouldn't be looking in this segment. "
"dfc3","February 2007"," Whereas I agree that $40,000 shouldn't be a ""cap"" anymore... maybe something like $45,000 should. As a Mercedes-Benz C Class owner, the C350 (with options) can still be had for well under $45,000, but not under $40,000. I'd imagine the BMW 3 Series would fit the same bill for the best engine/package in the line. "

I find it hard to believe that someone is looking at a base CTS and a 335. There is just too much of a difference in price and monthly payments. Thus, while they are both ELLPS they are not competitors. Also, MSRP is accurate for the Japanese but is not accurate for Americans. The ELLPS segement should be defined based on model, not price.

"qbrozen","February 2007"," of course i agree that many cars can be bought for less than msrp, but the reason why i am so adamant that msrp be the only measure when setting up the parameters of a discussion is because, as i posted here long ago, you are asking for trouble when you use anything else. You could have a vehicle thrust into the discussion based on anecdotal evidence of a one in a million deal. And what happens when a car fits the price cap one month due to a special rebate and employee pricing but then goes back to being too expensive the next month? MSRP is the most consistent and reliable measuring stick we have.And as far as being defined by model, that is a topic we have covered before as well. If it were purely on model, then the TL and S60 would be excluded because they are not the entry-level models of their manufacturers. "

"habitat1","February 2007"," ""Then again, they also refuse to offer RWD.""Except, of course in the case of the S2000. It is a conundrum that Honda has produced a $33k limited edition sports car that matches the $50k Boxster and, IMO, crushes the Z4 and SLK in driving dynamics and performance, but has left their mainstream Acuras struggling to compete in the ELLPS market with FWD and the LPS market with AWD and an anemic V6.I still think my 2004 TL 6-speed at $32k was a nice balance of luxury and performance compared to the 2004 crop of competitors. But now one would need to spend $38k+ for a TL-S to get a manual transmission, no more luxury and slightly more horsepower driving the wrong wheels. The 2007 TL-S is less competitive, IMO than the former 2004 TL 6-speed, relative to its price, performance, value positioning. If I had to do it all over today, I'd likely be on a plane to Germany doing the ED thing. "

Thus, while they are both ELLPS they are not competitors. Yet they might very well cross-shop a 330i. $40K, or a $10K range, is more than the manufacturers themselves consider to be a ""segment"". Raising it to a $15K range is just too much, because, honestly, you are righ. People shop by payment almost exclusively these days. And $35K, maybe pushing it to $40K is vastly different than $45K. We're talking abot $600 a month versus $900+ a month. That's a whole different level to the first time LPS buyer.(hence the ""entry level"" part)CarsDirect Price: $42,775Guess what car that is? A BMW 5 series! $45K is more than a 5 series starts at, so $45K is plainly too high a limit.CarsDirect Price: $44,417Guess what car this is? A GS350. Again, $45K is too high a range for the sort of car we are discussing. Cars Direct Target Price: $43,395This is a Porsche Boxster. And we all know Porsche vastly inflates its prices.

The original poster actually said that as well - no souped-up ""V/R/etc"" type cars. And, yes, since the 338i is technically under $40K, I have no problem keeping it - though it's obviously probably the most expensive car ANYONE wold possibly consider in this segment. ie - they'll splurge for a base model 338i.. maybe. But certainly not anything else. "
"bruceomega","February 2007"," I'm curious to see what the opinions are after test driving the 2008 CTS when it becomes available.

"plekto","February 2007"," It should be nice, *If* GM can actually make a proper interior. I'm 110% with Top Gear on this one - American manufacturers idea of luxury is to make a bigger version of the same thing or slap some leather on it. They just don't get it, with maybe 2-3 exceptions.Hopefully the CTS will be one of them.NOTE - GM and Ford make excellent luxury cars outside of the U.S., so it's not that they can't - they just choose to nerf us. "
"cdnpinhead","February 2007"," We're talking abot $600 a month versus $900+ a month. Well, not exactly.In the first place, most people who find monthly payments of this nature a problem don't buy, they lease. Even beyond that, BMW & Benz (among others) subsidize leases (through money factor and/or residual) to a fare-thee-well. The only time a lease makes sense to me (I can't write it off as a business expense) is when the manufacturer makes the monthly lease payment artifically low. I may actually lease a car next time -- amazing, at least to me. I generally buy & hold.The people who can actually afford cars in this segment either make the payments you cite, pay cash (or a large fraction) or lease.If you can't pay, you don't get to play. "
"dhanley","February 2007"," ""NOTE - GM and Ford make excellent luxury cars outside of the U.S., so it's not that they can't - they just choose to nerf us.""Hm. Don't agree with that assessment.The problem(imo) is that the average domestic buyer isn't going to pay $5000 extra for the sort of thing that tends to differentiate us/foreign luxury cars. Perhaps GM could build a caddy as good as a merc. But the average caddy buyer won't pony up the extra $10K not being spent on a bigger vehicle, and the average merc buyer will take their sweet time warming up to cadillac. I have a buddy with a CTS and even he says the interior sucks. But he wanted a big decent-handling luxury car for cheap, and he likes the exterior. "

"fedlawman","February 2007"," IIRC, their were ""normal bias"" tapes at 120uS (Type I), and ""high bias"" tapes at 70uS (Type II).The normal bias tapes were made of ferric oxide and the high bias tapes were made of chromium dioxide and later, metal (Type IV) was introduced.The first cassettes that were considered hi-fi were the CRO2 tapes when used with Dolby B noise reduction.I bought my first hi-fi cassette deck in the mid-80's. It was a Denon DRM-44HX. I used ""metal"" tapes and Dolby C with ""headroom extension (HX). The deck had an internal computer to custom tune the bias to the particular tape by recording and analyzing test tones on the tape (this was more accurate than pushing a button to select ""normal"" or ""high"" bias.This is pretty much as far as the compact cassette format evolved. At the time, CD's I recorded onto metal cassette using all the bells and whistles were indistinguishable from the original CD source. That's how I remember it anyways.Thanks for the memory tayl0rd. I was quite the hi-fi buff back in the day, and I still have that cassette deck and those ""old"" recordings - they're collecting dust under the guest bed in the spare bedroom. "

Most CDs are compressed to about half their actual dynamic range in the studio so as to not damage your headphones or speakers. So, with almost all of them metal tape was/is good enough to capture everything. Of crouse, finding good metal tapes these days is hard - the best ones weighed about 3-4 ounces each and had ceramic or metal cases and parts. They jsut don't make them like that anymore.I'd say it was comparable to 1/4 inch tape running at 3 1/2 inches a second.(reel-to-reel deck).

"blueguydotcom","February 2007"," Today my fiancee expressed an interest in checking out possible cars to replace her now gone 2001 S80. She said she wanted compact, somewhat luxurious and powerful. Obviously she's driven my 06 330i. She finds it fun but not to her liking (I really wouldn't want two of the same car in the family anyway).So we stopped by VW and she drove a GTI 4 door. Not a ELLPS, i know. But it leads into her reactions to the next two cars:Acura TSXAcura TLWe got out of the TSX and I already knew she didn't dig it. When pressed by the car guy she matter-of-factly said, ""That car is soooooo slow.""The dealer was actually pretty smart as he didn't flinch but said, ""Well try this TL Type S. It's got some power."" She agreed; I knew what her reaction would be but figured it would be amusing anyway. We got onto the road and he asked her, ""So how does it feel?""""Heavy and huge,"" came her immediate response. She's never heard me mention the TL ever.We returned to the lot and he suggested an Accord V6. She has already been in them an answered instantly: no, old lady car. Sigh, I think she may be driving her backup car for sometime as we've ruled out all SUVs, the Acura/Honda lineup, BMW and MB.

"
"plekto","February 2007"," You could always go with a roadster, you know... :P The sad fast is that anything FWD will feel sluggish and dead compared to a RWD setup, because the steering is by definition going to have torque and weight on it bogging it down.And 3500+lbs kills anything right there as well - it starts to feel like a GM or Ford in that it's good in a straight line, but lacks the tossability of say, an old BMW 2002 which is probably the best example of a sports sedan ever made - pure and simple and a blast to drive. But two cars she should try are:The older IS300. I has a great balance of power versus weight, compared to the too-slow IS250 and the silly priced IS350. It's the ONLY Japanese car I ever drove that felt like a European one. But then they de-powered the base model and made both cars so much more heavy... Ack.The other is a RX-8. With leather, it's not too bad as far as feeling a bit luxurious. But it's light, quick, and fast. It feels a lot like well... like you took a G35 and dropped 500 pounds of dead-weight. Because the RX-8 weighs 3000lbs, yeah, it kind of IS exactly like that.Plus, if she likes stick, it's even better.IMO, the RX-8 handles better than even a 3 series. Herehsy I know, but the thing is that it's roughly 300lbs lighter and HP isn't everything. I'd take one over the 328i anyday.(the 335i is definately better, but dang what a pricetag) The IS350, at nearly 3600lbs is... well, yeah... It bludgeons its way through corners like a 5 series or Mercedes.

Same HP(230 vs 232). Of note is how the rear seats are very close in size to each other. If BMW thinks you can actually fit a 5th person in the center rear seat... http://www.edmunds.com/new/2007/infiniti/g35/100822701/specs.htmlYes, it is almost 500 lbs heavier.

Same interior problems with the IS. Evo is an economy car and feels it. Same with the WRX. Really if the A3 gets shot down she's gotta re-examine her priorities.

There's no way she's coming out ahead in that case. (ie - might as well try to fit a child seat in a smaller car than suffer with a boat)There is another option, though...The IS300 Sportcross. This is a wagon version of the IS, and as such, has more rear room(though it's exactly the same, it FEELS larger - like the Volvo 240s did, for instance). It also could be had with stickshift, making it a solid performer. Me? Unless you have a baby now, the reality is that a booster seat or even most full-size baby seats will fit in the rear of a RX-8. Shoot, I fit a full-size one in a Focus(rear pasenger seat), though there was only about 1 inch if clearance. "

Not going to happen without a huge gimmie somewhere, and the child seat seems like an obvious first place to start. Afterall, the difference between the rear passenger and rear center isn't that much in terms of safety, and there are dozens of makes of child seats.And, yes, the RX-8 can fit a child seat in the rear. The seats are very low. I felt as comportable in the rear as most compact cars in the front. Think of it as a car with 4 bucket seats.As for the space, it's like the Porsche 928. 2+2, so the rear takes a hit on paper because there's no center at all - it's all one big driveshaft tunnel and center console(which is awesome to use as a passenger, btw). I'd venture it loses about 15-20 cubic ft right there. But since most small cars don't USE that center rear area in actual use(child seat aside, which makes the rear good for NOBODY ELSE), it's like you took the 15 cubic ft of the least useable space in the car and got rid of it.When I get in the rear seat of a car, I sit behind the passenger if possible, THEN on the driver's side. Middle is only if I have no choice at all.It's small, but look at what his wife wants. She wants a 3 series but with a Minivan's cargo space by the sound of it. If she goes small, the truth is that the rear will BE small - but since only small kids will go back there, it's not a huge deal, is it? I'd concentrate on trying any and all cars first - actually drive them all, then worry about if a seat can be wedged in the rear or not. "

Nice, straight-up, tall roofline. Zero headspace issues. Gobs of flat glass. It feels very spacious inside - like cars fom the 50s did.(as opposed to the high-beltline angled glass mess we see too often)Better dash layout. Better bonnnet, battery up in the engine, so there's enough depth now to put upright grocery bags in the rear, better cupholders... it all felt like they took the mini and refined it ever so slightly. And darn it, I liked it more, despite not wanting to.  It made the old one look like it was an economy car and this had the extra bit of polish to it that made you think it really was a BMW.It's a bit wider in the back seat as well(and fantastic headrests). The S just came out this week. The Base is coming in 2-3 weeks and is the car to get, though(IMO), since optioned out you can get one for under $20K, and the base engine is TONS better than the old model's.Also, a basic Mini with only a few options to keep the price down is something like $1000 a year or less in depreciation. For a Family, it would work for a few years - there are two latches in the rear(seat clips into them evidently - it's a system more often used in Europe) BMW has custom-fitted child seats, IIRC, so fitting to children in the rear should be simple.edit:new engine(looking in the booklet I got)172hp/177lb-ft torque 0-60 6.7 secs15.1 second quarter mileTop speed 139 mph.This is the standard S - without the ""works"" package.The base, though, does 0-60 in 8.5 - much better than the old automatic. 32/40mpg!

"nkeen","February 2007"," But when it comes to driving experience, US has no soul in the luxo/performance arena, save the C6, IMHO. I think every car has a personality which you either like or don't. When I first came to the US I worked an airport valet parking job, which allowed me to briefly sample many cars. I was always OK with the basic honesty of US products, but from the first time I sat in a Japanese car it was dislike, from the ""ting tong"" of the warning chimes, to the overly light feel of the controls to the smell of the interior. That said, I bought an Acura TL last time around, and regretted that choice, although on paper it was a great car and the automotive press largely raved about it. The lesson is, buy what you want, not what someone else says you should want. Speaking as a free-marketer, it is unfortunate that so many people just refuse to consider the products of my adopted country (I mean US owned companies) when so many jobs ride on those decisions. Pure automotive snobbery.I think the real problem for the US industry is that car purchase decisions are so wrapped up in self-image -- how much does this thing add to my status among peers. Unfortunately, to purchase an American car simply isn't cool to many. "

Also during this time, the Unions built up the jobs to stratospheric levels of costs in the quest to ""protect"" these jobs.

Add in driving dynamics that with some exceptions (Subaru) just aren't right. I wouldn't argue with the honest goodness of the Honda Accord (either the US or the Euro/Japanese versions).I couldn't even read the kph indications on the speedo of my TL because of the deep blue color used.

I have owned two Lexicon PrePros in my HT and found Logic 7 a superb processing capability that does wonders for HT.

I think the BMW web site had a mistake on cargo capacity, but outside of that it was uncanny just how close in size the 08 CTS is to the 07 530Xi.

Thus, a buyer might be willing to overlook the fact that it doesn't handle like a BMW because the interior is nice, assuming that the GM beancounters don't trash the interior. With the current CTS, one can't overlook the relatively poor handling because the interior is awful. A question, isn't the top CTS, the 3.6, engine available in the G6? "

Too big and still too American.

These things have been supersized all the way out of their classes, to the point that they have had to start importing whole new classes to get the feel back. A3 is a perfect size, IMO.

"joe131","March 2007"," It is an easier and cheaper task to build a great performing and handling little car than it is to build a great handling bigger car. BMW builds a nice little compact car, the 335i. Cadillac builds a nice mid-size car, the CTS (EPA). If the CTS was built to compete with the smaller car in terms of handling and performance, as well as having similar luxury and appealing styling, we should expect the CTS to cost more.There are always compromises. Just depends what's most important to you...cost, size, luxury, perfomance. So, no clear winner here. "
"fedlawman","March 2007"," I think it depends on how you define a ""bigger car.""Is the Cadillac at a disadvantage because it is longer bumper-to-bumper? Or is it because the wheelbase is longer? Maybe the Cadillac has an advantage because it weighs 100 lbs less than the BMW?I suspect all have an effect, but ultimately, it comes down to solid engineering and long-term refinement. The BMW handles better because it is purpose built to be (and historically is) better. An evolutionary vs. revolutionary design is what makes the BMW #1 in ride/handling. Cadillac came up with the brand-new RWD Sigma platform 5 years ago - BMW has 30 years of E21, E30, E36, E46, E90 evolution. The Sigma platform is very competent (and the 2008 CTS (Sigma II) should be even better), but it won't be a match for BMW for a long, long time. "
"joe131","March 2007"," For purposes of ELLPS, I'll define bigger in terms of passenger and cargo room. The more of those there is, the harder and more expensive it is to make an excellent handling and performing car.Usually, if you have more passenger and cargo room, your car will also be heavier and dimensionally larger too. (For example, Bentley, not an ELLPS, is a major exception with its subcompact luxo-cars.) It is also usually easier and cheaper (less complex engineering) to build a little box stiffer than a bigger box. Try it with cardboard, you'll see. Put wheels on a stiff box and it handles better than a flimsier box.Porsches are littler than BMWs. And Porsches handle and perform better.If you build littler cars (BMW), you have an advantage in handling and performance over what the builders of bigger cars (Cadillac) have.It is about compromises. BMW compromises by making its cars little inside so they can handle and perform better than bigger cars. Cadillac thinks its customers will appreciate the extra room in exchange for compromises in handling.It's nice to have choices. "

"cdnpinhead","March 2007"," . . . solid engineering and long-term refinement. This, I think, is the crux of the discussion, particularly where North American competition (to the BMW) is concerned. I bought into the Lincoln LS hype back in '99 & ended up with the first manual-transmission-equipped Lincoln in 50 years or so. I'm guessing it'll be at least that long until there's another one. I was so looking forward to replacing my V6 manual LS (the manual was only available with the 6) with a V8 manual, along with other tweaks that result from several years of production & feedback from the field -- I figured by the time I was ready to unload my car a much superior version would be available. What I got instead was the cancellation of the manual altogether, and the LS itself not long after. This is a car with an aluminum hood & front fenders, as well as suspension parts, anti-dive suspension, ventilated rear discs (ten consecutive stops from high speed with no fade) & a number of other things that caught my fancy & convinced me Lincoln/Ford was serious about the car. Oh well.Anyway, refinement, incremental improvement & fixing what breaks is what makes a superior product -- not throwing the whole damn thing out every five years or so and starting over. I still enjoy my LS, but would never buy another American car in this class, even though the CTS does have merit. Fool me once. . .I prefer to deal with an automobile company that takes sports sedans (& wagons) seriously and has done so for decades. "

But with a nice long wheelbase, good leather, a decent stereo with Sirius Radio, and power pedals even -- what a lot of car for the money. Heck it has ESP and some fine Mercedes underwear.

But, to keep comparing cars based soley on wheelbase or 0-60 times or cubic hectares per fortnight seems (to me) to miss the point.Shipo, the question stands, did the 5 series somehow fall from grace?

Sorry, but there is no subsantive reason to pay $10k more for a German luxury car vs a Cadillac or Lexus. German automakers have convinced Americans that their vehicles are worth a hefty premium over other luxury cars when there is nothing to back up this premium in terms of warranty, dealer service, reliability, performance, etc. There was a performance edge at one time but the new Cadillac and Lexus models are erasing that fast.

"1487","March 2007"," ""The problem with the CTS is that it will never be as communicative and responsive to the likes of the BMW and Audi because it is not engineered to do so.""Audi? Surely you jest. The CTS has a nearly 50/50 weight distribution and RWD layout which you wont find in any Audi. I've never heard anyone suggest that the STS and CTS were lacking when compared to Audis. The CTS was developed to compete with German cars and much of its development happened in Germany. I dont know where you are getting your info about CTS development. The CTS was the first of many GM models to get extensive time at the Ring during development.The CTS is larger and heavier than the 3 series and thus isnt likely to be as nimble. I don't know that its lacking compared to the 5 series though. Many seem to feel the curretn 5 is somewhat less connected than the last gen model, especially with the silly active steering. ""Have you ever driven one of these BMW babies for any length of time?? This car is like putting on a set of wheels, chassis and engine and hooking it to your brain.

And yes, people have been inside the car and verified the materials are top notch. I have to wonder how any car enthusiasts has missed the positive reaction to the CTS. As for Caddy interiors: check the '08 CTS, DTS, Escalade, XLR, and '07 SRX before stating Caddy cant design a nice interior. The CTS is the only bad interior in the bunch.I wouldnt equate Art and Science to the gangster-mobile 300 styling at all. Just because they both use large grilles doesnt mean they have anything in common. I dont see anything over the top about the STS (many feel its too conservative), SRX, DTS or XLR. the '08 CTS is many things, but ""cartoonish"" isnt one of them. The general consensus is that the car looks very good. Even the design critic at Automobile who hates most everything he reviews was gushing over the car. If you think the CTS is ugly I do wonder what luxury cars you find attractive. I dont equate bland with attractive but you seem to be critical of Caddy designs because they are bold and stand out. would you prefer if Caddy when the lexus route and copied German designs? "

"habitat1","March 2007"," ""Sorry, but there is no subsantive reason to pay $10k more for a German luxury car vs a Cadillac or Lexus. German automakers have convinced Americans that their vehicles are worth a hefty premium over other luxury cars when there is nothing to back up this premium in terms of warranty, dealer service, reliability, performance, etc."" First, don't even think about putting Cadillac and Lexus in the same sentence as if they have something in common vs. German cars. Nice attempt at association, but that's like me saying my golf game has more in common with Tiger Woods' than Phil Mickelson's because I'm right handed. Second, there is no ""substantive"" reason in the world that anyone should pay any more than $25,000 for a CTS. My 2004 Acura TL 6-speed cost $32,400 new and is now worth (30,000 miles), according to Edmunds, $24,600 on trade-in value. That's a total of $7,700 in depreciation. A 2004 CTS with 30,000 miles is worth a measily $18,300 in trade in value and had an MSRP of over $40,000 (without many features the TL had as standard equipment). If you add $7,700 in depreciation to the value of a CTS, a new one should have cost $25,000 to be fairly priced against a TL. And that's assuming one can get past the butt ugly looks. :confuse: The reason Cadillacs aren't worth crap as 3-4+ year old used cars is .... well they really aren't worth a whole lot more than that new. It's just that some poor people actually think that by going cheap up front, they are saving money. My 12 year old Nissan Maxima with 155k miles is worth more than most GM's, including Cadillacs, that are half it's age with half the mileage. And it looks and runs better. Forget a BMW 3 series or 5 series, a three year old CTS with 30,000 mile would have actually cost you as much or more in depreciation than a Porsche 911S with MSRP of well over twice as much. Doesn't necessarily make me feel less guilty driving my 911S, just a boatload smarter. "

The 3 Japanese cars definitely win the resale side.Looks are subjective. Fun factor (also subjective)--the BMW wins. I've actually driven most of the cars in this segment. That LARGER CTS is more fun to drive than the smaller Lexus IS 350. Service? The best service is a car that only has to go in for routine maintenance. The sales guy at my local BMW *bragged* about the number of loaner cars they had available. That didn't inspire confidence in the reliability of the car. Your mechanic friend is stuck in the past.OW, IMHO, you should at least test drive the CTS, the A4, the 3 series, the new C class (no one is talking about that redesign), the G35, etc. As much I love the exterior looks of the CTS, I would consider myself an incomplete shopper if I didn't at least test the G35, the TL, the IS, the 3 series, etc.I guess we do a new car around this time every year.

Like I said earlier, compared to an Accord, maybe so, compared to a 3-Series or a 5-Series, not happening. As for my not personally liking the CTS, uhhh, well, after driving it, it wasn&#146;t hard. FWIW, shortly after I bought my 2002 530i 5-Speed, I took a drive in a CTS. I have no idea who or what opined that the CTS was a legit contender, but I have to question its motives. Those two cars were as different as night and day and there is no way the CTS of that era was even qualified to sniff the fumes of the 530i.You keep equating my critical opinions of the CTS because I don&#146;t like it. The point you&#146;re missing is that I didn&#146;t initially like it because besides being ugly inside and out, the early version of the CTS that I drove was a poorly executed, noisy rattle trap that had sloppy handling, an anemic engine, crappy ergonomics and uncomfortable seats. Yeah, I didn&#146;t like it, and for good reason too.&#148;You are saying the the IS was way too small but the 3 series was spacious?

Look it up.&#148;You say you value manual trannies and the CTS has one but you are trashing the CTS. Interesting.&#148;You&#146;re pretty funny. The first couple of times I went into a Cadillac dealership to drive a manual CTS I had the sales person actually tell me that I didn&#146;t really want to drive a manual. When pressed, I was told by the salesman from both dealerships that not only did they not have any manual CTSs in stock, they&#146;ve never even had one in and never would. At that point I had nothing left to lose, so I asked about ordering one. Once again, in both cases the dealerships refused to even consider the option, &#147;We won&#146;t order one because we know that you don&#146;t really want a manual transmission and that in the end, you&#146;ll stick us with the car and demand an Automatic version instead.&#148;FWIW, just about a year ago I did manage to happen upon a dealership that had a 6-Speed in stock and they were only too happy to let me drive it, I suppose the figured they&#146;d finally found a sucker to unload it on, anyway, it drove okay, and while the transmission was smoother and easier to shift than the one in my 1970 Challenger, it was still stiff and clunky compared to the tranny in the E60. That said, I believe that both transmissions are made by Getrag, so I&#146;m at a loss to explain the difference. Shifter maybe?Other thoughts on last years&#146; drive of the CTS; the interior looked about as horrid as the early cars that I drove, however, at least it was screwed together better and had much better fit. The engine had also been dramatically improved over the early models, so much so that I&#146;d even go so far as to say that it was competent. Not as smooth as an I6, but then no V6 is so no loss there. That said, the car&#146;s suspension was still sloppy, the seats were still uncomfortable, and the ergonomics still weren&#146;t ergonomic.&#148;Most people like the new CTS interior.

People in this group tended to opt for manual tranny, sports package but usually not so hot on the luxury items.Group 2: Those whom are looking for a car that's A LITTLE sportier, A LITTLE faster, A LITTLE more luxurious and A LITTLE better looking (subjective I know) than the regular midsize 4-door sedans. People in this group tended to opt for auto tranny and usually won't push their cars to the limit nor track their cars.I personally think it's silly to count any worthy candidate out of contention because of reasons such as lack of auto tranny, FWD and softer ride than the benchmark (3-series). The reason why this segment is booming is because now-a-day there are so many different choices in the market so almost everybody out there could find one for his/her liking.Ah, it's good to be back...

I like the CTs interior based on the pics, but the magazines (and Edmunds) share my opinion. People who have been in the car at the show also said it feels as good as it looks. Dont know what else to tell you. I cant take anyone seriously who thinks the '08 CTS interior is crap. That just shows you refuse to give credit where it's due. Any complaints about the 300hp engine or 6 speed transmission? Let me guess, you dont believe the magazines when they say those features will be available. ""No, I think that you&#146;re parroting the scribes who regurgitate the marketing bilge fed to them by the auto companies. ""If these scribes were praising BMWS (which they do) would you stil be insulting them? Of course not. They are merely pointing out the positive features of a car they like. If you honestly think that publications like MT and C&D which are known for slamming GM products are just making this stuff up or repeating what GM told them to say you are truly out of touch. The car is nice and they wanted to convey that in their reports from the NAIAS. simple as that.""Oh, and FWIW, the same day I drove the CTS 6-Speed last year, I drove an A3 2.0T 6-Speed. Yikes, what a difference.""Yikes! The CTS is only about 4 years older than the A3 and thus it makes sense that the A3 seems fresher in terms of design and execution. The CTS is in its final few months of production and you are wasting keystrokes criticizing a 5 year old design that is about to be retired. I wouldnt buy the 2007 CTS at this point with the new car coming out. Cadillac addressed your criticisms of the car and you are stills saying the '08 is mediocre at best. Go figure. "
"1487","March 2007"," ""First, don't even think about putting Cadillac and Lexus in the same sentence as if they have something in common vs. German cars. ""Are you seriously stating that cars like the GS, IS, STS, CTS, etc. have ntohign in common with the C, E, 3 and 5? LOL! YOu have got to be kidding me dude. I know that Lexus doesnt offer manuals but aside from that it is completely absurd to sit here and say Lexus and Caddy sports sedans arent even in the same ballpark. First of all MB and Audi models cant even get with BMWs in handling and thus they are no better than CAddy or Lexus models. If BMW has an edge, its a very slight edge that cant even bee noticed in street driving. ""Second, there is no ""substantive"" reason in the world that anyone should pay any more than $25,000 for a CTS. My 2004 Acura TL 6-speed cost $32,400 new and is now worth (30,000 miles), according to Edmunds, $24,600 on trade-in value. That's a total of $7,700 in depreciation. ""Never said the CTS is a leader in resale value but I have to admit your numbers seem a little off. I rarely see used CTS models around here for under $24k or so. Are those numbers based on one particular car you saw for sale or did you get that from kbb? sorry but $40K to $18k in three years seems a little off to me. We all know that Acuras have good resale value and if that is your only concern than the TL is great. Of course to people who want RWD the TL isnt an option. Since we are talking about resale value I think is important to note that the amount saved when buying and financing a new car is significant. If you save $100 a month by getting a CTS over a German car and invest that over the course of your finacning period (60 months) I think that $6000 could earn enough to offset the difference in depreciation. But I'm sure you've already thought of that. "

I brought up the A3/A4 - cars I know drive better than a CTS. Every review of the CTS I have seen has had praise for the steering feel and the CTS does not understeer any more than other sedans in this class. I've driven the CTS. The hack journalists never really tear into cars for being underperformers. The art of automobile critique - much like film critique - has been reduced to either high praise or middling support with enough superlatives to keep the ad dollars flowing. Anyone recall the flap when the LA times' car guy tore into GM? What happened? Yeah, GM pulled advertising. So tell me, can I trust a magazine with ad dollars at stake over my OWN experience? No. My money is more important to me than what some pandering auto journalist writes to protect his job.It surely has less propensity to understeer than an Audi.not in my experience.

Most of the press says the 3 series is the benchmark sports sedan but according to you I should disregard that since mags are biased and often off base. I hardly quote buff mags as gospel but certain things have to be accepted based on how often they are agreed upon by the automotive writers from numerous sources.

Why is it a dip causes massive undulations that continue as if the car had bad struts/springs? Why is GM still in business? So many impossible to answer questions and in the end I'm left with a simple fact: the CTS is not the kind of car that will ever grace my garage.

I do not find where the CTS has been poorly put together. Exaggeration does not count as fact around these parts. I can't believe you could honestly use the word overpriced referencing any non-BMW model. If anything, BMW has allowed the price in this class to rise to these ridiculous levels. 6. The CTS' dash, while industrial looking is actually soft to the touch (grained portion). Lutz and GM have acknowledged spending big money on dashes that looked cheap. Now, they've come back with a nicer looking dash than probably cost less money to make. Is the CTS less ergonomic than an A4's tiny button array with no ""off"" button for the A/C? Was it's high centrally placed nav system less user friendly than the C's COMAND, iDrive or Audi's interface which placed the jog control on the right side of the screen furthest away from the driver? These comments are utterly ridiculous and much like the auto writers you are blaming, it seems you haven't dug deep enough into the cars that in your mind are so superior. Judging by the sales of the current CTS, you seem alone in your opinions. I doubt most people who buy cars in this class are even enthusiast. A 50 year old woman in my department wants a 325i not because of it's reputation as the ""ultimate driving machine."" She wants it because it's a BMW and she doesn't like MB's (no reasons cited, just a matter of taste). She drives very slow and uninspired.

They must serve people who like to drive as well as people who only want one because it's a cadillac. BMW markets their cars to enthusiasts only, which is fine.

Of those 4 cars, only one was an exceptional car that never had a single problem: the Mazda. Does CR's data back that up or refute it? Don't know; don't care.

My point was that as far as publishers go their data and test methods are the most reliable and are tied to the specific purpose of the vehicle. That's why some of their highest rated vehicles are sports cars. So, they don't always just base all comparisons around the Accord and Camry. Oh, as for the reliability/IQS scores you should realize they are based on the likelihood you'll experience a problem. Simply stating a car is reliable does not mean it will never encounter problems. It merely means the ones rated highest have the least likelihood of experiencing problems. So, it's probable but not likely a car rated highly can have a lot of problems and likewise a car rated poorly can have none. "

The plastics are of extremely high quality and have that ""soft"" feel to them. The steering wheel on sport and premium trim lines in an extremely high quality leather (I agree Audi screwed up the base version steering wheel big time). However, you can still get a sport or premium 2.0T A3 for less than 30K MSRP.Numerous reviews have praised the interior ergonomics and refinement. The leather seats are very nice. Even the base version cloth is superior to other cloths. The A3 is a luxurious, more sophisticated and faster Mazda 3 Hatch, and is priced accordingly. The Mazda 3 is a great car for its price by the way. Features do not make a car entry-lux.

You put Cadillac and Lexus in the same sentence comparing them to German cars. Japan competes with Germany pretty well. In spite of owning a 911, I am still not afraid to steer soemone to my former Honda S2000 over a base Boxster. But when I consider all factors: build quality, fit and finish, driving dynamics, resale value, styling (subjective as it may be), I just can't accept that Cadillac really competes with EITHER the German or japanese premium cars. ""Never said the CTS is a leader in resale value but I have to admit your numbers seem a little off. I rarely see used CTS models around here for under $24k or so. Are those numbers based on one particular car you saw for sale or did you get that from kbb? sorry but $40K to $18k in three years seems a little off to me.""

But I do believe that the ridiculously low resale values of GM cars in general (forget trucks and the Corvette) says a lot about their long term appeal. One thing I can almost guarantee you - if I took my 12 year old Maxima w/ 155k miles to a GM dealer, I'd be hard pressed to find a 3-4 year old car with 40,000 miles that looked as good, was a rattle free and drove as well.

"dontbuylexus","March 2007"," Break dust IS really annoying, but lets get to the heart of the problem.When people are compairing brakes (Lexus, BMW, etc) they are mostly disucussing issues with pads. It is true that every 20k I had to replace my pads on my BMW. But the difference with the BMW and the Lexus is that when I replaced my BMW pads, the rotors were perfectly fine and I got 3 sets of pads out of the original BMW rotors. On the flip side, with my Lexus IS250, I need to replace the pads and the rotors that the pads wore down 2mm. (Lexus does not machine at the dealer, you have to go outside of the dealer, then that gives them a fall guy to blame later ""it was that non-Lexus shop that damaged your car, sorry not under warranty"")I expect to get high amounts of dust and frequently change the pads on any and all high-line perfomance cars. What is totally rediculous is having to replace the rotors with the pads every 20k and having Lexus think that it's normal.FYI: I bought my IS 01/03/05 and 20k later up to today have had an issue with the brakes and they kept telling me that it was my driving. At the same time, they had this document in their TIS system:Then on 06/30/06 Lexus released a TSIB on changing the brakes on 06/07 GS and IS models under warranty (free of charge), because so many people were complaining about the brakes. Here it is:The interesting part here is not that they finally ponied up to fix their mistake (minus the rotors yet), but that it shows what type of a company they are when they blame you for a problem, knowing that the problem exists because they officially dont want to take responsibility for it. That is not what BMW does in my experience during my ownership of my 330i. It was always ""Have a seat Mr. Will and we will see what the problem is with your 330i, or would you like a courtesy car?""Lexus is a baby Enron in my opinion. "

I think they try to be as accurate as they can, but they are, at best, based upon a lot of hypotheticals that don't match my own experience. I have always paid cash for all my cars. Has kept me from ever spending beyond my comfort level. Depreciation is a factor I consider, if I think there is a chance I'll sell/trade the car in less than 5-7 years.From Kelly Blue Book, the ""trade in"" value for 2004 models of the Acura TL 6-speed w/ Nav and the CTS 5-speed w/ Nav, 30,000 miles each and ""excellent"" condition:Acura TL: $23,875 vs. current MSRP of $36,125 = $12,250 ""loss"" vs. new MSRPCadillac CTS: $18,625 vs. current MSRP of $41,180 = $22,555 ""loss"" vs. new MSRPEverything on the TL (other than Nav) is standard, so it's hard to be sure I'm correctly optioning the CTS, but at a minimum, it appears the difference in MSRP is $5,000 without all the standard features offered by Acura. The ""true cost of depreciation"" by my calcs shows the TL $10,000+ ahead of the CTS. Those are real numbers that are from real (KBB) trade in values today. You ask the Edmunds host and others how they came up with their figures. It is a mystery to me.P.S. I suspect you'll counter that GM might give me a bigger discount on the CTS than I could get from Acura on the TL. But I managed to negotiate a $10,000 discount on a brand new 2005 Porsche 911S from a Baltimore dealer when the best I could do in the DC area was about $1,500 off. I would rather work hard to get a decent/good discount on a great car, than get a great discount on a (IMO) ugly, lower quality car.P.P.S. My Acura dealer wants to buy back my TL for cash at slightly MORE than KBB Trade in value. It is a highly desireable car in the used car market.

They are best estimations of what an average owner can reasonably expect, not numbers based on your own personal cars and your one person experience. I already told you that.MSRPs on the 07's don't matter because Intellichoice starts by giving the shopper a reasonable target purchase price, not one that requires them to drive to your Baltimore dealer or one that might for some reason sell a car with a discount six or seven times that offered by another dealer. In the case of CTS/TLS the target prices were CTS $31,302 and TLS-S $36,504. The five year ownership costs are averages for average owners, not supermen like you who achieve special deals on price, insurance, repair costs, financing, resale, fuel, maintenance, etc. But I agree with you if your idea is that a person should not necessarily seek a purchase price or resale price that some guide says is average.I trust you for your own opinion of what your own experiences are with your own cars in your own mind. Fair enough?But for a more realistic comparison guide as to what average owners can expect from any of hundreds of cars, I'll trust Intellichoice or Edmunds or Kelley, etc. Even if their numbers don't end up exactly matching mine after I buy, own and resell a car, my guess is that their rankings of one car against the others would still place them in about the same order in cost of ownership as I'd have realized had I owned several hundred of the cars at the same time.

"dfc3","March 2007"," chavis10 says: ""The C class is the most inferior car in the segment"".I just had to chime in here. I bought a new car 11 months ago and went with the MB C280. I believe it really depends on what one is looking for in a car. I know that all the pundits seem to toss the C-class out as just not cutting it; but I compared to the BMW 3-series and the CTS (mine is an '06 not an '07). I have to say I was impressed with the CTS, in that it turns on a dime, is responsive, has good output (I tested the 2.8 liter/210 hp version). I went with the C280, though, for a few reasons. First, I wanted a car with AWD given I live in a snow and ice area.Second, I wanted a car with great suspension tuning; with all the $%& potholes around here.Third, I wanted a narrow car (all of them are in this class), and the C-class was a couple of inches narrower than the CTS (or the BMW). I have a small garage and live in an urban area with tight spots.So... my criteria could be a little different than most, but in an area where there aren't huge differences between these or the G35, IMO, its the little things that are important to different people that vary from buyer to buyer.

Buy that car and say it's worth 58% in 3 years. So 19.1k residual. That means he's out 17.2k (33k + 10% TTL). The 47k car drops to 27260 (assuming all the features are shown as a value add...which they aren't!), so the guy who got that car is out at least 24.4k (47k + 10%ttl - residual). Of course that loaded car's features won't all be listed, so he's really gonna be down even more. "

"andres3","March 2007"," PS- one of the cars in my garage is a Mazda3 for commuter duty.

The press and reviews don't mean jack to me because they worship this little annoying car. No one said a Mazda was as reliable, dependable, or as fuel economical as a Honda or Toyota.However.. Mazda did used to have a solid 4/50 bumper to bumper and 5/60 powertrain warranty, so I'm sure you will benefit from that.

"andres3","March 2007"," I don't know what you people count as ""sport"" or ""luxury"" but any ""premium"" brand base model vehicle with no options is about the dumbest buy you can make. First of all, I'm pretty sure most of the European profit is earned from the overpriced ""options"" you seem to love. Their base pricing is quite reasonable.Secondly, calling a sport luxury base model ""optionless"" is wrong. For example, with a base A3 you still get:17"" alloy rims and wheels.ESP, dual auto climate control system, Front and front side air bags, ABS, EBD and all the other acronyms VW and Audi make up.You get the same 2.0T engine, the same transmissions, the same body, the same paints, same suspension as premium model) the only real loss is the steering wheel (in my opinion). To me, a luxury/sport car is one that has a good structure (chassis, frame, suspension, engine, transmission, wheels, interior quality, comfortable seats). Everything else is just an added ""feature."" Tons of features does not make a luxury car. My 03 Accord V6 had everything standard included (including your beloved 8 way power seat) but I didn't consider it more luxurious than my Audi. "

"fedlawman","March 2007"," I'm getting sick of all this CTS, M-B, BMW bashing. All this talk about the CTS and M-B C-Class is really splitting hairs. I think some people on the boards (myself included) are sometimes guilty of exaggerating their feelings a little for the sake of making a point. The point may be valid, but IMO, the gulf that separates these cars is not the chasm that some would have you believe.Sure the CTS isn't as tight or nimble as the BMW, but it is still a fine entry-lux sport sedan. If you like the looks and the feel, and get a screaming deal at purchase, it can be a fine choice. The C-Class is another bird altogether. The M-B (with sport suspension) is right up there with the BMW in ride/handling dynamics, it has a bank vault rigid body structure, and it has a quiet, refined demeanor. Quality has been a problem, and some interior plastics are cheap, but perhaps the new C-Class addresses these issues.The Lexus IS didn't live up to the pre-release claims of building a better 3-series - so what? Although, when driven side-by-side with the Bimmer, the Lexus lacks steering feel and handling response, taken on it's own merits, it's still a very competent sport sedan with the bonus of high quality materials and outstanding expected reliability.The challenge manufacturers have in this most competetive segment is choosing who they want their buyer to be, and then making a car for them. Infiniti is a fine example. The previous generation G35 was a great handling, snorting stomping, fun-to-drive sport sedan. Unfortunately, Infiniti listened to the complaints about NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) and cheap interior quality, and they ""fixed"" those issues - at the expense of responsive handling and tight dynamics. IMO, Infiniti has turned the G35 into a Buick and ruined it. Yeah, we have a tendency here to describe molehills as though they are mountains. Those of us with track experience (more of us here than you think) can feel and appreciate the undeniable edge that BMW's possess over their very fine competition, and we're not willing to sacrifice even a drop of performance in return for electro-luminescent instruments or perforated leather seats. Others here are looking for a different blend of luxury and sport and probably can't tell or don't care about the subtle differences in driving dynamics of any of the cars on this list. Bottom line - none of these cars are pure sports cars. They are too heavy and possess too many compromises for the sake of refinement, luxury, styling, room, and price. The car you buy should be the car that possesses the balance of these traits that most appeals to you and fits your lifestyle. "
"andres3","March 2007"," You sort of made my point. You can get tons of ""features"" and options on a Honda Civic (including a moonroof and all), but that doesn't make the Civic a luxury car.You can get a Hyundai with so-called luxury amenities these days. To me, a luxury car isn't the nameplate, but is more about the driving experience. The sophisticated and refined suspensions and drivetrains, the interior comfort, ergonomics, and material quality. You can get leather in a Mazda, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of the leather in an Audi. Honda's leather also falls a league behind Audi's. A lot of cars have leather wrapped steering wheels now, but they don't compare to the feel I enjoy on the Audi leather wrapped steering wheel. Should they include a few more items as STANDARD equipment? Probably they should. Xenon lights would be nice as standard. I can actually live without leather seats though.... I could use a 6 CD changer... that would be nice, my Honda had that. But no matter how much content you put into an economy car, it'll still never be luxury. Case in point: VW is regarded as having very nice interiors. The GTI or GLI Jetta do have a ""nice"" interior, but compared to the A3, falls about one league behind. A3 is luxury, GTI/GLI are nice (for an economy car). "

"plekto","March 2007"," Most of the cheap stuff is actually leather powder/goo that's sprayed and texured onto a substrate or is a thin veneer on a backing. Ford is famous for this junk - you can see it when it starts to crack and split. There's what looks like cloth behind the leather? Some white crap holding it together(or not in this case)The Audi and luxury makes - well, SOME of them use real full-grain leather. Real cows, the same as you see in a leather jacket - and lasts 20 years or more like one, too.I tihnk this is the biggest dissapointment for me with the new C class. It's quite obviously manufactured leather. Me - I'd get cloth seats and then pay the dealer $1200 to put in real leather. The dealership near me(I'm in Pasadena, CA) told me that for $1200, they'd re-do the mb tex/cloth crud with the Napa leather they use in the S class. They even had a car that they did it to - a 4 cylinder C class. And dear lord it felt like the car was suddenly a mini Bentley. The same almost cry to sit in it feeling a Porsche 911 has.

A smooth engine and great suspension make the car.That seems a little odd because luxury brands seem to revel in the fact that they offer so much cutting edge technology and uneccesary luxury features.Some do. BMW allows you to buy the car for what it once was: a performance sedan. Many of us lament that we can't delete other features - moonroofs for one. We want the chassis, not a sunshade. What good is a luxury car that has no more features than a Honda Civic?Drive a Civic at 19k and a 33k 328i. Or a 31k G35. There's a quantum leap in handling and on-road prowess, comfort, refinement. This past weekend I drove a Mazdaspeed3. The car's insanely fun. The power's giggle inducing, the reflexes sharp and the car's light and enjoyable. At 26k loaded with every option it's a decent price. Lose the top end junk and at 22-23k before negotiating, it's a steal. But you notice the little things. The dash, the seats, the sound insulation = all feel a little cheap. I was driving an economy car that had been tarted up to street/track performance levels. Underneath it's still an econo car and felt it. The chassis felt maxed out and car was too boy racer for me with the snappy shifter, loud exhaust and always ready to rumble engine. IMHO it should take more than a badge to have a luxury ride.Agreed. When I'm slicing through a 30 mph corner at 70 and the e90's bolted down, I know the engineering behind the car is on a different level from anything else I've driven recently. Maybe thats just me though. Regular cars have so many features these days that I dont think there is much reason to pay premium dollars for a stripped luxury sedan.Regular cars are still built for people who want numb appliances. They're not interested in throttle oversteer. They want seat heaters. I want smooth transitions in corners; they want navigation systems and bluetooth. I want to feel utterly secure at 95 on a snowy day in Switzerland; they want a 6 speed automatic that never bothers them.In the case of buying say a MB or BMW, you're buying what went in to the car underneath the sheetmetal/plastic. Have you looked at the slalom numbers of the 335i sedan Edmunds just tested? The car nearly put up 70 mph. http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Followup/articleId=119739/pageId=119- - 930Flipside, look at the Accord V6 and Camry V6 from a 2006 test:http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Comparos/articleId=109710/pageId=693- - 05The test price on that Camry was 31k. For that kind of money I can get into a 328i with sport package, comfort access, and xenons through european delivery. Now tell me, will most notice the car's ability to pull almost 10 mph more through the slalom? Maybe not. But to an enthusiast, that's the reason to buy the car. "

"chavis10","March 2007"," A3's chassis and structure are based on a $15k economy car (as as was the old TT). I don't see how that's luxurious. My point to you all is that if I'm gonna pay the premium for a near lux car, it'd better have something to make it more special than a loaded Altima besides intangible things as ""nice chassis and solid frame."" We as consumers can't measure the stiffness of a frame or gauge how durable a CV joint will be. What I can do is get in a compact car that cost $33k and realize it doesn't have leather, heated seats, HIDs, etc and wonder what I'm paying for. I don't think average people who aren't obsessed with brand image can make rational sense of such a purchase. Just my opinion. My aunt's S430 doesn't have any options, but hey, it's a Benz so it must be a ""nice"" car. $72k+ with no HIDs and 16"" wheels. "

"fedlawman","March 2007"," ""if you're a consumer who likes cars and plans to spend time in it and enjoy it, gimme some features.""I agree AND disagree with you.I agree that if all you do is sit in rush hour traffic 2 hours every day, you don't need a 3-series, CTS, TL or any other sporty sedan. A 4 cylinder Camry is just as refined and comfortable, and has the leather seats, Sat-Nav, and laser-guided cruise control you crave.I believe that an ELLPS is supposed to be for the person that wants comfort, quality, safety, and luxury for their M-F carpool, but also enjoys attacking Mulholland Drive or attending an occasional HPDE on the weekend. There is no better car on the road for doing both very well than an ELLPS.Now, the difference between the BMW 3-series and the Cadillac CTS is relatively small. If you never drive above 8/10ths of your cars (or your own) capabilities, you'll never notice the difference - just pick the one that has the looks/driving feel you like. OTOH, if you do decide to raise the fun up a couple of notches, you will quickly separate the wheat from the chaff.The overboosted, lightweight steering of the CTS (or IS350 for that matter) makes the car feel very nimble and responsive at 8/10ths. At 9/10ths, the lack of feedback and light touch require extra concentration and minute steering corrections from the driver - now the car is beginning to feel ""twitchy"" and unstable. At 10/10ths, it can be downright scary (in reality, thanks to the traction nannies, it'll just push and decelerate).For 90% of drivers who are shopping this segment, I say, just stay below 8/10ths and enjoy your Lexus, Cadillac, Acura, etc. "

The CTS-V would trounce the TL-S performance so easily it would not be fair.By the way, Intellichoice rightly considers the CTS and the TL-S both near luxury sedans.The mighty CTS-V is categorized as a Sport Sedan.

"cdnpinhead","March 2007"," Well, if we're going to discuss physics, bring it on. It's what I do for a living -- applied physics actually, otherwise known as engineering.The 5-10X statement, which I'm assuming is the one to which you're taking issue, works out like this:In the West (and other areas I'm sure, certainly in Canada), where it freezes in the winter, things appear on the roads in the spring called ""frost heaves."" Posted speed limits in those areas try to protect: 1) the suspensions of most cars, but more importantly, 2) the roads themselves from Class 8 trucks that hit them at high speeds. Point being, the limit can be as low as 5 mph. I don't have a problem going over them at 50 -- my car has an actual suspension.The 5X has more to do with the posted cornering speeds on the road between the whorehouse at the intersection of US 95 & Nevada 266 and Big Pine, CA (the CA state highway number becomes 168). This road rules -- I love it. It's in the middle of nowhere & has almost no traffic on it. I've taken every vehicle I've owned since 1970 (except the KW) over it, and it demands (and rewards) attention. Many of the corners are posted at 10, but it's perfectly possible to go around them at 50 and have a good time in the bargain. If you're not paying attention &/or don't know the road, you can die. If you are, you can live, big time. This road (among many others) is why I own cars -- to drive them.I'm not talking about Interstate mind-numbing appliance driving here, but that's not all bad either. I'd much rather spend the day (as I did today) driving from east of Indianapolis to LaPorte than sitting at my desk back in Phoenix. "

The differences that are ""so slim"" to you may be huge to someone else. Ask me why I prefer BMW to Cadillac or Lexus. Easy, for the same reason why I tell time on an Omega wristwatch instead of a Seiko, or why I listen to music on Revel loudspeakers instead of Bose. It's because I perceive and appreciate the difference in quality and performance, and the added expense is worth it to me.Most people think spending $40,000 on a BMW with vinyl seats is a rip-off. The same argument holds true for $4,000 stereo loudspeakers or a $1,600 wristwatch. The point is clear - if you can't tell or don't care about the difference, don't spend the money. When I'm purchasing a ""high dollar"" item that I am enthusiastic about, I buy quality, not quantity. Be it a car or a waterheater, I will always choose a quality engineered product with ""no frills"" over a trinket festooned with buttons and lights - and my 20 year-old BMW and 16 year-old Omega (which both still look and perform like new) have more than validated my philosophy.

If, after performing all due dilligence, I decide that a BMW 3 loaded to the gills is the ride that will put a smile on my face vs. a G, TL, CTS, A4 et. al., and I've negotiated the best price that I believe I could have, then what a great value that is! If you want a BMW, you pay a BMW price. If you end up with your second choice for ~$5k less, but think I could have had a V8, is that as good a value?Someone posed the question regarding what do you get when you buy a BMW, MB, Audi, etc. Beyond the car and its inherent attributes, you do get the badge which can connote different things that may add ""value"". Take MB: There is a certain heritage and history that the three-pointed star represents including the genesis of the auto, important innovations in the evolution of the auto and a reputation for ""bank vault"" build, for example. This may mean nada to some, but to the buyer of the car there is great value. Why do I own a (TAG) Heuer, Omega and IWC wristwatch (among others)? Do they keep better time than a Citzen/Seiko/Invicta? Nope, but there is a history behind the Swiss brands that adds value TO ME (especially IWC as it is Swiss with New England roots). 99% of the population wouldn't know the difference between an IWC and an Invicta and would certainly think me a loon for spending a bit more on the IWC, but I enjoy it immensely. A good value to me, not to the other 99%. But they just do not count, I am not spending their money.

That is my point, let's stop the exaggeration of pretending that other competitors cannot be entertaining compared to the 3 for owners who need and demand a better rounded package with more value (someone like me and I'm sure many others even if they are members here).

"andres3","March 2007"," Saab and Caddy's rank near the very bottom of the list in terms of reliability from Consumer Reports' latest data which I read about last night. They have a chart similar to Problems per vehicle, but instead use a more intelligible % less and % more than average reliability based on all cars from all models. So the median/average is 0% reliability. 50% would be 50% more reliable than the average vehicle. -50% would be 50% less reliable than the average vehicle.SAAB and Cadillac have serious issues! Audi has done as they promised and brought reliability back to respectability and CR recommended (even the first year A3). Honda and Toyota are dominant. Subaru is truly performing at Japanese levels. Mazda, Suzuki, Nissan, & Mitsubishi lag behind. They noted that some Nissan models were good while others were terrible. The one's that were terrible were all built in the US however. VW still has poor reliability.Audi promised years ago to improve reliability and have done so, leaving VW in the dust. Mercedes has been negatively affected by Chrysler, and instead of Chrysler improving with the merger, MB has joined them in the pits. "
"andres3","March 2007"," I agree... when you are driving, it really doesn't matter what the exterior looks like (except the hood) or what color it is (except the hood and side mirrors).Therefore, I wouldn't go so far as to say I don't care about exterior looks, but I value interiors much more.By the way, the A3 is not an econobox. It has advanced suspension systems and components. All you have to do is drive one to figure this out. "

"fedlawman","March 2007"," The $38,230 price I quoted for the Cadillac CTS turns out to be for the ""Sport"" model with 18"" wheels, sport suspension, and few other options.The CTS that most closely compares to a base 328i with optional leather seating is the ""3.6L Standard"" model. With optional power moonroof (the BMW comes with one), the Caddy stickers for $34,630. The BMW without the seat heaters (this CTS doesn't come with them either) has an MSRP of $34,545.Also for reference, MSRP's (rounded off) for some of the other ELLPS's:Acura TL - $34,000; TL-S - $38,000Lexus IS250 - $31,000; IS350 - $36,500Infiniti G35 - $34,000BMW 335i - $39,500M-B C230 - $30,500; C350 - $39,000Audi A4 2.0T - $30,000; 3.2 - $36,000Here's my take on this class:If you're shopping for an Auto Transmission equipped ELLPS, I think the G35 pretty much offers the best bang for the buck (HP, handling, luxury, quality, features, etc). If you're shopping for an ELLPS with a Manual Transmission, things get more interesting. The G35 is out of contention because it's 6MT drivetrain just sucks. I'd then eliminate the IS250, M-B C230, and both Audi's because they either lack HP, weigh too much, or both. The Lexus IS350 and Acura TL don't come with an MT (too bad), so they're out.That leaves the Acura TL-S, BMW 328i and 335i, the Cadillac CTS 3.6L, and the M-B C350 Sport. #1. A bare-bones 328i for $33,000 is #1 on my list for it's best-in-class handling dynamics (it weighs 250 lbs less than the 335i!), solid straight-line performance (0-60 in 6 seconds flat), upscale cabin appointments, and outstanding value for the dollar.#2. A tie between the 335i and Acura TL-S. The BMW offers RWD handling and more power, but the TL is less expensive and has more standard features. Both are outstanding sport/luxury sedans that offer a different blend of performance vs. luxury.#3. I haven't driven the M-B C350, but I have driven the outstanding C230 Sport. Assuming the C350 offers similar driving dynamics but more power than it's little brother, I'm thinking that the C350 offers BMW 328i performance at a 335i price. Of course, who can put a price on the ""Mercedes feel"" - it is a nice piece.#4. The Cadillac CTS needs evolution. It has good ride and handling, but the BMW and M-B are better. The 3.6L engine is smooth and sweet, but the CTS barely manages to reach 60 MPH in under 7 seconds. It's also ugly and cheap looking. I can't think of a single reason to choose the CTS over the less expensive BMW 328i. This is the oldest car on the list though, and the MY2008 CTS is looks promising. "
"calhon","March 2007"," ""They have a chart similar to Problems per vehicle, but instead use a more intelligible % less and % more than average reliability based on all cars from all models.""It may seem more intelligible to you, but the reality is it hides vital information.Is the average 2 or 10 problems/cars? If it's 2, the difference between average and 50% below average is merely 1 problem/car over a period of years. With an average of 10, you're looking at 5 problems/car -- an entirely different ball game.So, which is it? What if the average is only 1 problem/car? "
"fedlawman","March 2007"," ""By the way, the A3 is not an econobox.""I think chavis10 is wrongly referring to the A3 as an ""econobox"" because it is built on the Volkswagon A platform shared with the New Beetle and Jetta, among other cars. The $40,000+ Audi TT is also built on this platform.What chavis10 doesn't realize is that the size of the platform has nothing to do with the cost/economy/rigidity of the platform.

My recollection is that they are uniform and consistent and done so direct comparisons of cars are meaningful.

If the best times are achieved dumping the clutch at 4000 rpm on a manual or holding the brake while revving the motor on an auto trans car, that's how they launch them, even if it is hard on the car. That's why their times are always better than Consumer Reports. "

I've sat in the back of cars before that say they have exceptional leg room - like the current honda accord - yet because the seat is so low to the floor, they're far, far more uncomfortable for me than even an old Mrk IV Jetta - which had seemingly little legroom but because the seats were so high, one could sit bolt up right, knees cocked at 90 degrees.

Again, what's your problem? Yes, the e90 is too big on the inside for me - do you get it's a personal preference? The lack of cockpit feel, the super wide front seat, the expanse from door to door makes the car feel very buick-like. The e46's interior was better for me. No other way to put it. Add to the fact that compared to the e46 the e90 is also heavier, longer, more isolated, has less roadfeel and overall feels like a barge, yeah, sorry if I'm not doing cartwheels over the car. The G35 felt worse as I had the sensation of being squeezed by the dash, sides, etc. The car's banal power delivery, chatty-rough engine, heavy and numb steering and the total lack of flingability ruined the drive. It was not an edge of your seat fun car - it was more 5 series clone. And truth be told not too far off from my e90 - which I don't like either.I've got a narrow range of what I find acceptable. Picky in the extreme about everything. I want it all - decent space, power, handling, lightweight, docile when requested, loud and brash when pushed. At this point, no car really achieves that. The e90 is close but the weight, isolation and size issue make the car impossible for me to enjoy.

I suspect the G35's ""insanely tight"" front seat would probably not have bothered you in the least, had it been attached to an E36 M3. Or maybe it would have. To be honest, I enjoy reading your posts more than most because I know you will never hold back on how you really feel. As in ""BMW builds such crappy cars"". But I also assume you are more than intelligent enough to know that such extremely worded comments are also more likely to elicit responses. For example, I have close enough to first hand experience (i.e within my extended family) to accurately claim that if BMW builds ""crappy cars"", than Audi is fully two notches below BMW on the feces scale. Don't take my responses as anything more than a friendly volley back at you. You serve up a lot of aces that I agree with, but I'm still holding a racket, just to keep you honest.  "
"hauss","March 2007"," I'm talking about the sedan also. blueguydotcom, how can you find the G35 small inside when you drive a 330i? Your car is smaller. What was it about it that made it feel smaller to you? "
"hauss","March 2007"," hab, I've got to agree with blueguydotcom on the interior space of the G35...to an extent. I found the driver's seat to be a bit cramped too. Now I'll admit I didn't drive it but I've sat in it twice now (once in a show room and another time at an Auto Show). I felt like a lot of things were creeping up on me much like blueguydotcom felt. I wonder how it drives? Suppose I should test drive one someday for grins and giggles? Also, I know the numbers suggest the G35 has the most combined leg room but why does it seem that my TL is roomier? Maybe it's the little things like the design of the back of the front seats or something. "

"hauss","March 2007"," I went to the Atlanta Auto Show today and got a chance yet again to see all the major ELLPS up close and personal. Just wanted to share some thoughts on what I saw. I'll keep it brief. I'm unimpressed with the current CTS. The materials used for the interior are subpar. I believe the interior materials used on the new Camry are nicer. There was not one thing I liked about the interior. So, to me it was not luxurious in the least. I was also not that impressed with the interior of the IS350. I've heard several on here state it's the nicest of all the ELLPS but a lot of gray plastic trying to look like aluminum and little leather trim. It wasn't horrible but I didn't find it to be as nice as an Audi's or a TL's. And for all you CTS fans. They had the 2008 on display and it is a sharp looking car on the outside. You couldn't get up close and personal with it because it was off limits to get in. From what I could see though it was a marked improvement in every way. Very nice looking car. Alright all of you...fire away! "

"
"spiritinthesky","March 2007"," If I were you, I'd take a little more time to make sure you really want what you are going to get, before you sell your 330i. To me, a Volkswagon GTI seems like a dramatic change, and not an obviously positive one. You may be calling the 330i a ""big isolated tank"" to help convince yourself that you want to make the move to something else. I would just hope that you aren't finding in a few months that the budget oriented VW, with front wheel drive and a turbocharged 4 cylinder (still a hefty 3,150 lb curb weight) isn't your cup of tea either. And with VW's poor resale and lousy dealership/service reputation, that will only add insult to your injury. I have no axe to grind with VW. Nor do I feel particularly loyal to BMW - I tried my best to talk a 30-something single associate out of a 645i two years ago and now he's taking a bath because he finally figured out it wasn't a sports car and is sick of driving ""an old fart's GT"". If you have any second thoughts, that's a good sign to hold off. Your 330i won't depreciate significantly if you hold onto it for another month or two. But the wrong decision could have you personally and financially frustrated.P.S. Same is true for wives. I'm fortunate that although not all of my car decisions were the best, I'm still happily married to my first. P.P.S. I'm writing from Germany. Took a 997 GT3 for an extended test drive on the autobahn. That 8,400 rpm free-revving engine and light weight RWD now has me feeling like my 6 month old 911 Turbo is an overweight tank! It happens to the best of us. "

"allargon","March 2007"," The front seat of a 330i w/ the sport package is leagues more comfortable than the '07 G35 sport. I'm not sure about Blueguy. However, anyone with shoulders (fat, athletic, muscular, etc.) will probably not like the G35 Sport. The seats just made my arms feel pushed in--more so than many compact cars I've driven. In fact, I would have to go back to the times I rented an Aveo (definitely not ELLPS) from Enterprise to recall such a cramped feeling. I don't recall there being much headroom w/ the G35, either. I'm also 5'7"" and err... larger than many of you. The only seat I thought felt a bit loose was the CTS.Driving position and comfort is a major factor with any car. It's amazing that the current CTS (lacks telescoping steering wheel) sells so well. "
"hauss","March 2007"," I'm 6' 1"" and ~200 lbs. My build is I guess you'd say athletic and both the 3 series and G35 are cramped up front for me but the 3 series I find more so. I just sat in them both again yesterday at the Atlanta Auto Show and I was squeezed. I had surgery on my left shoulder and haven't lifted in 6 months because of it and I was still squeezed. Maybe that's why I found the G to be better this time around compared to the last time I got in one. They're both nice cars but just not for me. Now, the CTS until yesterday I had never even sat in. Man, they use some very poor materials in that thing. It's a good thing they're putting it to pasture after this MY. I mean what's with the joysticks on the vents? And I think the door material on a Civic might be higher quality. My apologies to Rockylee and plako but I now know why you guys are so excited for the '08 version. Without the badges on them one would never know those two cars are related. "
"nkeen","March 2007"," I've driven the GTi, both manual and DSG. It's a great car, especially based on a test drive immediately following a Mustang GT test -- horrible car. I was bitten by reliability problem in my Mk 4, but perhaps they've got their act together now. The Mk 5 was German built at introduction -- not sure if it still is. The back seat space is so big in those cars, I almost fell over striding into the back seat in the 2 door -- cavernous. "

Too narrow. Am I the only one with a 38' waist?

"hauss","March 2007"," I guess this stuff is subjective. I've read previous posts from you where you stated you felt the IS had the best interior in the class. I've been in one twice now and to me it's just loaded with large pieces of gray plastic. It reminds me of something I've seen recently in a sport edition Camry. It looks sort of space age and cool if you haven't been in anything nicer but it's just not high quality, expensive material like it should be in a car of this price. It's also the same material I saw in the 2003 G35 and it just doesn't say luxury to me. "
"louiswei","March 2007"," Ditto if Lexus is to replace those metallic plastic trim with real aluminum the IS interior will look even more upscale. However, Lexus does offer maple wood as an option over those metallic trim. For me I think the metallic trim makes the cabin feel more sporty so I am willing to accept that it's not the top notch quality material (But Lexus, why not the real aluminum??? :confuse: ). As for your information, I have been inside every ELLPS that the market has to offer and much more, IMO, the only other ELLPS that can rival IS interior's material quality (let's use the wood trim for this one, shall we), fit and finish and dash/gauge design are: Acura TL and MB C-class.3er utilized great quality material but the overall cabin design is just awful. Center stack looks like something from the 90s, definitely does not have a ""modern"" look that a current day benchmark ELLPS should have. I much prefer E46's over the current version. Audi A4, again, has great material but the design looks plain and out-dated to me. G35's cabin looks great from the picture but once inside, the inferior material starts to pop up here and there and eventually got on my nerve during a test drive. Also, the position of the controllers for the screen is just awkward. Why does Infiniti think that those controllers will be better off facing UP instead of facing ME, THE DRIVER is beyond me. :confuse: However, I do like the washi aluminum trim though, great touch. As for the current CTS, let's not even go there...I have great hope for the 2008 CTS and just hope it won't become one of those great-on-picture-not-so-much-in-person interiors.BTW, hauss, I am going to the Atlanta Auto Show this weekend as well.

"louiswei","March 2007"," Are you sure those wood trims are fake on the TL? Oh well, I much prefer the aluminum/metallic trim over wood anyway.Edit:I guess it is fake. From Edmunds: The TL Type-S receives a more powerful engine, a sport-tuned suspension, performance tires and more powerful brakes. The navigation system is standard, the interior is trimmed with aluminum and fake carbon fiber instead of fake wood, special sport seats promise more lateral support, the LED instrumentation glows red and blue and the pedals are finished in aluminum.Geez, even the carbon-fiber trim on the TL-S is fake as well. Looks like Acura does have to incorporate some cost cutting in order to offer the best value in class.Here's the link: 2007 Acura TL "

"joe131","March 2007"," Why even care if it is real or fake aluminum? Or wood?Aluminum oxidizes very quickly so it must be coated with plastic anyway. So even if you get real aluminum in your car it is real plastic that you touch and feel. And what would be so good about the feel of real aluminum anyway? Aluminum is not so pretty to look at. It is just gray. So what? And if they add fake grain effects to the aluminum, why not just make it real plastic to begin with? The plastic may be easier and less expensive to make and form into the pieces. That does not make it bad.Same idea with fake (real plastic) wood and real wood. The real wood is filled, sanded, polished and then coated with real plastic varnish or overlay, so why not just use real plastic instead of wood to begin with? If the manufacturers use real wood, they do everything they can to make the wood look like plastic, then they coat it with real plastic besides! So again, what you touch is real plastic, not the real wood underneath.Real wood is not so dimensionally stable, impervious to moisture and uniformly strong as modern plastics, so wood has a tendency to split, crack, shrink and expand which causes it to lose (in most people's opinions) its beauty eventually, and quicker than modern plastics would.Photographic images or artists' interpretations of real wood can be placed on real plastic so accurately that even an expert would have a hard time telling the difference.So what's the big deal?

"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," Hmmm, I love my real aluminum trim. Do i wish it was the black cube aluminum of my ZHP? Yep, but this stuff looks infinitely better to me than pimp-like wood in a car. "
"ggesq","March 2007"," The big deal IMHO is that none of the cars in this segment are your ""average"" daily drivers. The materials used in the inside should reflect the price being charged for the vehicle. "
"joe131","March 2007"," I see. So it is just the idea of metal and wood that you like better? You just want to be able to read on a specifications sheet that the wood and/or aluminum underneath the plastic surface is genuine?Ok. Gotcha. "
"andres3","March 2007"," I love my Aluminum trim in the A3 on the vents. You can actually feel and touch the aluminum metal, not plastic. Go ahead and flick it, touch it, caress it, it's nothing like ""fake-aluminum."" I vote for real aluminum; plus, it's shinier.  "
"louiswei","March 2007"," Hey Joe, let's put it this way, if I am going to drop 40 big ones on a car I'll sleep better at night if I know the wood trim or carbon fiber trim on my car aren't fake. Metallic trim I can live with since it is just plastic and one can't really fake plastic but I much prefer aluminum over it. "
"joe131","March 2007"," I like stainless steel better myself. Maybe I can convince car makers to use it everywhere. Or maybe a plastic imitation of stainless steel. That would be ok too. That real metal just feels so bad when it is super hot or cold. Ouch! "
"joe131","March 2007"," Well, I see your point now, and I must concede it is a good one.That would be very useful on those nights when I have a hard time getting to sleep.

"hauss","March 2007"," Haha! Very funny, but joe131, are you sure they coat aluminum trim with plastic? I think they may coat it with a silicate but that's not the same thing as straight up plastic. As for the difference between fake plastic wood trim and real wood trim highly polished just one look and you can tell. The fake stuff looks, well, eh, fake and the real stuff looks luxurious. Plus, when you tap your finger nail against it it puts off a nice little thump thump while the fake stuff goes tink tink. I'd rather the highly polished real wood trim thank you. "

"joe131","March 2007"," Some aluminum may be anodized or treated with phosphate, but may then be more susceptible to fine scratches from keys, rings, shoe soles and the like. The plastic coating which could be used on aluminum and wood has a strength and resiliency that resists scratches and nicks better than other types of finishes on metal or wood. "

"hauss","March 2007"," Yep, the '08 CTS is just a display model but it's a marked improvement over the old one. The damn thing was up on a rotating stage too and spinning pretty fast so it was hard to get a great look at the interior through the open doors on the driver's side. But it was enough of a view to tell it's exponentially better than the current CTS interior and certainly capable of being as good as it looks in pix.

I've been spending a lot of time at Lexus dealerships lately too as I just put down a deposit on a GS350RWD for my fiance last night. I should have noticed it. Anyway, when you're at the car show check out the carbon fiber trim (fake) on both the Vette Z06 and another high end car there whose make and model are elluding my memory. They're horrible. I'd say that Acura does fake carbon fiber trim better than any of 'em.  "
"[Deleted User]","March 2007"," Your points about wood v. metal v. plastic are good ones. However, why buy wood furniture when you can have durable plastic furniture? Why buy leather shoes when there are breathable plastic models? Why do people pay more for anything, when a lesser substance can serve or suffice? Why does anyone ever buy a Rolex watch? It comes down to personal preference, the market level in which you are shopping, and what consumers in various strata expect. You'd never expect plastic wood in a Rolls. If a car's competition all offer wood or metal, then plastic is probably not the way to go, regardless of its durability. The manufacturer who won't spend the extra few cents it takes to use real wood veneer may be pennywise and pound foolish. Look at the awful fake wood that used to be in cars, at the same time when British and German interiors used real wood. It is true that the fake stuff has gotten so much better--and some of the real wood now is poorly done or cheaply executed, and doesn't look as good as some of the fake stuff. The painted aluminum is the worst, because it eventually wears off in spots and looks as nasty as the old plastic chrome interior trim used to be. The real aluminum in my car scratches easily, but it doesn't look like anything but the metal that it is. I like that. Chacun a son gout. "

Of course they gave it 4/5 stars and said it was great anyway. I doubt that would've been the case if it wasnt a 3 series. Its just one more example that build and material quality have nothing to do with reliability. Automobile said this is the 4th long term BMW they have had engine problems with since 1994. Many have said they will respect the CTS when is reaches the ""world class"" status of its foreign competitors but to me world class embodies a lot of things. None of these cars is perfect and while the CTS's interior design is quite odd I havent heard anything about CTS engine rebuilds at 20k miles. I guess it all depends on how one defines world class.

"1487","March 2007"," There is only one domestic luxury manufacturer and that is Cadillac. They consistently rank higher than BMW and MB in dealer satisfaction. Build quality has been there for many years, even going back to the FWD STS of last decade. Any visit to an autoshow or dealership will confirm this. The STS and CTS are more than capable of matching the E, 5, 3 and C class as well as Audis in performance. Of course the CTS is old now so its underpowered compared to the 335i but that will soon change. The new CTS will most definitely be as good or better than the new C350 and A4 but no match for the smaller, lighter 335. Well I shouldnt say no match, I should say the 3 series will be faster and more agile. I have heard little that suggests that BMW/MB/Audi dealers can match Lexus or Cadillac in customer service. If you know of anything that states otherwise let me know. Prestige factor is up to the individual. Most people that post here would rather have a 328 than an STS-V because ANY BMW is more prestigous than any Caddy in some minds. Not in mine.

My thinking is nothing a BMW is capable of is ever going to be explored on public roads and I dont race my car so its pointless to pay more for a car that is equal to other models up to 8/10ths and is only superior at the limit.

"plekto","March 2007"," MB of San Diego also laughed outright when I requested a manual C class. ****Call the dealer in Arcadia, CA.(Near Pasadena) They are very willing to find you one with manual, since their top salesperson drives one with manual(and asking around, they all love stickshifts, especially in the roadsters). The C class, minus the sunroof, nav, and other electronic fluff, with a manual gearbox, is a joy to drive and actually quite reliable(its the electricals and accessories that fail on them - same as VW(same electronics/electrical suppliers for almost all German cars). Nav? Garmann and save $1000. Plus it goes with you if you need it to. The sunroof's too far back to be useable in the C-class, IMO - so better off ignoring it - plus a moonroof is basically a magnifying glass on a hot day. All it does is heat your car up even more.I almost bought a C230K this winter (certified, yada yada) - but decided to wait until this fall to get the right price/color. Stickshift, and that 1.8L supercharged engine is a fantastic combination. It's hard to find a C230 *sedan* with manual though(silly high resale value as almost nobody wants to sell theirs).Btw - the turnaround time on a manual C class is about 24-48 hours here in Los Angeles.

"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," Oh, hmmm. The A3 feels far lighter and more responsive. Move the wheel and the car responds now and the chassis doesn't slowly react like BMW's e90. The engine pulls and pulls effortlessly. It's disquieting how the 2.0T just starts pulling and never really lets up. Of course, the seamless, near instant shifts of the DSG also help make engine always seem like it's at the top of the car's 207 ft-lbs of torque. Again, lighter car, fast tranny, strong torque = fun.Now, it's light and responds quickly. Unfortunately, for me the heavy understeer of FWD still seems foreign. I don't recall my Protege ES exhibiting so much understeer. Also, the A3's heavier and more nose-heavy, I think, than my old 2003 ES; that may explain it some. Regardless, there's front end plow and as she got the premium package, the suspension's not set up for my aggressive style. For her, it's perfect.

I'm actually stuck in a predicament as I was aiming for the 4 door GTI but having two Mrk V-based cars with the same engine/tranny/chassis might be too creepy. Damn VW for not offering the R32 as a 4 door. I'm supposed to show my 330i to a perspective buyer tomorrow (another guy offered to fly in this weekend from SF) and I must say I'm now a little at a loss.

I mean c'mon...until about 3 years ago you had to buy an expensive option package to get power seats and a few years before that it was power windows! Those are basic things in a luxury car, with or without the P! Now, you have to upgrade the damn thing to get leather. WTF????? Here in Atlanta you can't throw a stone without hitting a 3 series. Be it one of the Banglelized versions or previous. And most of those are the base model and a good many of those are without the upgraded options that should be standard on a car of that cost. Even at the base model's cost. You cannot tell me most of those people are buying the car for feel. If we were to survey most of them I'm confident they'd mostly tell you they like the image and prestige of a BMW and think it looks cute! I will give them credit for this though. They're improving their base model to include more and more options. But get with the program, BMW, and offer leather as standard. Leatherette is a joke. And do it without raising the cost. There's no reason for the leatherette. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," Many people don't want leather. Many also want cloth as an option. Reconcile that with your luxury standards. In fact many BMW owners complain about all the junk on the cars now. Some don't want the moonroof or the auto AC or DSC. What about RFTs? Luxury some would say, while myself and others have ditched RFTs because of their weight and influence on handling. Personally, I would like a great deal of the sound deadening material removed from my car.If I go BMW again I may opt for the ette as I was in an 07 with it and it felt fine. Can't speak for most buyers. I know why many here bought the car. "

Then you'll get more go than show.Look over your paragraph for a second. We're in the Entry level luxury performance sedans forum. Does Porsche make a sedan? Nope. And FWIW, Porsche's interiors are great! The market for performance sedans is exceptionally small. You want 4 doors, power, handling, at worst AWD and a manual. Some might call the Evo and WRX performance sedans. After that you've gotta move to the Speed6/Legacy and then G35/3 series. Higher still would be the 5 series and yeah no others with even a manual. So if one wants some measure of luxury that pretty much negates the WRX/Evo options instantly. Stupid fun cars but they always feel like what they are - bargain basement rockets. Speed6 steps up the luxury but adds serious poundage and it uses a wonky Haldex AWD system. Legacy's got the performance part down but inside it feels cheap, cheap, cheap. So we're right back at the G and 3 series. When it comes right down to it, a performance sedan is not an easy car to come by. It's already a compromise vehicle as it seats 4-5 people, has 4 doors and thus must be kept to a certain shape/size. Many of us feel we've compromised enough by going 4 door sedan. We're opting for a basic level of utility in exchange for a few moments each day of fun. We can compromise more and get a FWD vehicle or an auto-only car but to the few of us that repress our Speed Racer Id, we feel like we've given up enough for the sake of family, job, etc, so we're not backing down from our basic vehicular requirements.I don't relish giving up RWD or a manual in my 4 door sedan. I'm living enough for others by getting a 4 door sedan - the hell if I'll surrender the last vestiges of fun I know in a car. "

"1487","March 2007"," luxury cars in general are rip offs and this is not something that applies to BMW alone> Anyone who thinks that the average 328 driver bought the car simply to attack switchbacks is out of touch with reality. Not saying that applies to you but thats just a simple fact. When most of these cars are used for low speed commuting more than anything else I have to question how anyone could honestly think most BMW drivers (or any other sports sedan drivers) are out abusing their cars and testing their handling limits on a regular basis. BMWs are used to drive to work and run errands in heavy suburban traffic just like other cars. Sorry, but I doubt that at least half of the people I see driving BMWs have any interest in pushing the envelope. I am basing this on the age and gender of many BMW drivers I see. They bought the car because its expensive and garners respect. Never said the same isnt true for Lexus models. "
"1487","March 2007"," well forgive us if we disregard your comments about domestic products. Its one thing to say you have no desire to purchase certain brands but you respect them when they make competent vehicles as opposed to saying you unequivocally hate anything and everything that is ""American"". I dont ever plan on buying a BMW but they make nice cars as long as you can afford them. In fact, I dont ever plan on owning any car from Germany regardless of my ability to aford a German car but I wouldnt go so far as to say I hate German cars. They have many laudable attributes. "
"1487","March 2007"," The only advantage Acura offers vs Cadillac is resale and better interiors. Of course that better interior thing only applies vs the current CTS and STS. Other Cadillacs look just fine as does the new CTS. I think the TL is a decent value but its too popular and too similar looking to the much cheaper Accord for my tastes. I also dont like that you cant get 18"" wheels, split folding seat and I think the wheel designs are dull. I am also not a fan of the cars rather lenghty front overhang which seems excessive, even for a FWD car. The best thing about the car is its interior but the IS and G35 have caught up. "

Leatherette is offered so BMW can ship out cars with optional leather and boost the sticker price.

I dont think BMW has exclusive rights to quality leather by any means. I think GM vehicles (esp Buicks, Saabs and Cadillacs) have very supple leather. Most buyers in this segment dont want manuals so in my book the IS not offering a manual isnt going to matter much. I think the car's sales prove me to be correct. Not that I am a fan of the car. "

"habitat1","March 2007"," louiswei,I couldn't resist pulling your leg on the definition of ""PATHETIC"". I own two cars on the opposite ends of the option pricing strategy. My TL 6-speed's entire list of possible options was a total of two: navigation or no navigation and all season or summer tires. For the automatic, you don't even get the second choice. The option list on a 911 is about 10 pages long and yes, the standard seating surfaces are Porsche's version of leatherette and mettalic paint was a $825 option. My former Honda S2000 came with standard leather, standard metallic paint and 0 options, period. Pick your color was it.It doesn't bother me that BMW's pricing strategy makes you check a box and pay extra for leather. I can do the math and figure out if it's still a good deal. Granted, perhaps BMW could get some economies of scale and pass some savings on if they just made leather standard. But for some, saving a few dollars and taking a 3 series with leatherette may be more comfortable for their budget. My leg pulling was that Lexus gives the sport oriented driver no manual transmission option in the IS350, period. And then calls it a ""sport"" sedan, not a compact ""luxury"" sedan (I think). That's higher on my scale of pathetic than optional leather. And it's a gripe I also have with AMG in the SLK55 and C63. That said, I'll let it go - and your leg as well.  "
"nkeen","March 2007"," My TL had good brakes and, to my mind, was fast. It just lacked balance and wasn't fun to drive. Hair trigger clutch; heavy, uncommunicative steering; poor, flat-spotting EL42 tires; a feeling of having to fight the car whenever the road camber varied. My 325i is more intuitive, drives more as a mechanical extension of my intentions. There's more to it than numbers, and I look forward to driving the little sparsely optioned (ZSP, manual, white with black leatherette, poplar, xenons, heated seats, Sirius) Bimmer every day. I wouldn't call it a luxury car (my original choice to replace the TL was a Mk5 VW GTi, also a great car to drive). Someone said on this site that a C-class is a step on the way to an E-class, but a 3 is the destination. Absolutely.In the TL's favor, Honda does know how to put together a decent stereo, and the climate control is well-behaved and powerful. Many people clearly like the car. Perhaps mine was a bad one.BMW cup-holders: not an issue, and kudos to the Bavarians for providing ones that, with little subtlety, indicate that they view the marketing requirement to include them with appropriate contempt.

The TL comes with everything pretty much standard.

What is counterproductive about having wheels large enough to feel the wheel wells and give the car a sportier look?Most automakers have dealer accessories, but we all know Honda is notorius for making relatively common options available solely from the dealership. The TL has most of what you need so most people can shy away from the accessories, but there is undoutedly an overpriced spoiler and set of larger rims waiting for you at the dealer. I dont see why this is necessary. TL-S is fast, but I dont think speed was ever the base models problem. In terms of acceleration the base model is good enough for me. I just think $4k should get your more than a bigger engine and quad pipes. No other car company makes hi performance models and doesnt add larger wheels. Acura needs to join 2007 and put 18s on the S at least. The Civic Si and TL-S shouldnt have the same wheel size. "

"hauss","March 2007"," I disagree with you 03accordman. My feeling is that the majority of 3 series buyers do not buy it for it's driving feel. I know several people that own them and I know for a fact that they got the car because they like the prestige and recognition of the brand; they like the the appearance of the car; and it's in their price range. And there's nothing wrong with that. Off the top of my head just one of my ten friends that owns one got it for the performance and he's got an M3 (the rest have 325i models). Also my term ""buying a badge"" is the phrase he uses all the time to describe those buyers I'm referring to. Now, I'll admit that my little informal survey is hardly gospel. It's not statistically sound. But neither is your assumption that they get the car for it's (supposedly) superior chassis and suspension. And you cannot suggest that because most of the people on this forum agree with you that makes your viewpoint correct. Going that route would bias the data toward a more specific population of 3 series buyer. And to joe131, I don't find the 3 series to be common nor the best of the ELLPS class. I think it's a good car. What I'll disagree with is everyone that thinks it's all that and a bag of chips. It's got a list of shortcomings just as long as every other car on here. If it were truly the ""ultimate driving machine"" the other auto makers would be struggling for any kind of market share in this segment. They are not. Last year BMW sold 88k 3 series sedans, Lexus sold 80k ES350s, Acura sold 70k TLs, Lexus sold 55K ISs... That's a lot of cars being bought by people not choosing BMW. "

The 3 series doesn't appeal to many buyers for the simple fact it's more expensive than the competition, they find the seats hard, they find the ride hard.

I drove the Catera sport model many years ago and honestly its overall feel was very similar (especially at the helm) to a 5 series of that era.

"1487","March 2007"," The issue is people are clinging to outdating notions of what various brands stand for. Right now I would say only Lincoln and Lexus represent what we think of as ""traditional"" american luxury. Lexus of course offers the IS and GS but generally speaking Lexus isnt willing to trade any quietness or ride quality for sportiness. Infiniti, Cadillac and MB to various extents make vehicles designed to deliver what used to be the exclusive realm of BMW models. I totally disagree that people who buy a G35, M35, CTS, STS, etc. dont care about handling as much as BMW owners. The people who buy these cars (in some cases) do care about handling and performance but they feel that there are superior choices to the 3 series or 5 series. 15 years ago BMW has little company in the RWD performance market but that has changed. Now there are numerous quality choices for those who want a RWD or AWD performance car. I'm pretty sure the owners of the 3 series' competitors would be offended if told that the ""only"" reason they arent driving a 3 series is because their driving skills are too dull to understand the 3 series is the only choice for those who like performance.

"kdshapiro","March 2007"," I don't know why people in the general sense buy a G35, M35, CTS, STS, I only know why I bought my BMW. I submit you don't understand that somehow BMW vehicles and marketing converge to convey a message that people understand. The product fulfills it's intended mission and has a heritage that people know and understand. I do not believe you understand this. They are a successful company because they understand who wants to drive their cars and what these drivers want. I prefer not dwell on what notions people cling to, I dwell on the sales numbers and the financials.Frankly, whoever suggests people buy a BMW just to take the car to the limit each and every time is really off base. I would be very happy driving my $45K BMW at 10mph all day long. "

Sure the 3 is more capable of tackling a track than a camry but for most people its not going to make a difference, especially today when a camry get accelerate as fast as a $35k 328i. People buy luxury cars for features, styling, performance and prestige. Increasingly, you can get performance and features in cheaper cars. Camry vs 3 series may not count but Lexus vs BMW does count and Lexus is the best seller. One could argue that Lexus has figured out what American consumers want moreso than any of their competitors. Soft luxury sells obviously. The Es has one engine and body style and still racks up 70k in sales. I think that is pretty substantial considering the 3 series has a much broader model lineup. "
"1487","March 2007"," All luxury cars are purchased for their prestige factor. There isnt much else to justify paying the high prices commanded by luxury vehicles today.

"1487","March 2007"," none surpassed it according to whom? While C&D refuses to say any car beats a 3 series one could argue that G35 owners feel the 3 series has been surpassed because otherwise they would've gotten a 3.For my money, the G35 is the better car. The 3 may have slightly better handling but that doesnt mean its wholly superior. There is more to a car than track numbers. I think the G35 has a far better interior, better pricing and equal overall performance. "
"1487","March 2007"," BMW does have heritage but so does Cadillac, MB and Jaguar. Only the Japanese brands lack heritage. BMW has only recently risen to the 2nd place spot in US luxury sales and that is due to a proliferation of models. 10 years ago there was no X5, X3 or 6 series. Their lineup gets bigger and their sales continue to increase. They will be adding another SUV and the 1 series so I suspect their sales will continue to climb. If BMW stuck to making sporty cars only its sales would be subtantialy lower in the US. 6 or 7 years back BMW was behind Lexus, cadillac and MB in sales but they have come on strong with all their new models and variations on those models.BMW sells cars based on it carefully crafted image and advertising. In reality its not that their cars do stuff that cant be done by others, its the impression that ONLY BMW makes sports sedans/coupes that drives their reputation to mythical levels. "

"1487","March 2007"," everyone is entitled to an opinion but when reviewing the driving impressions of the vehicles you mentioned in various magazines there is nothing to suggest your take on these cars is accurate. While many say the 330/335 is the best car in terms of handling, that is not the same as saying the IS/G35, etc. is too soft. In fact the recent C&D comparo indicated that the G35's ride was a little to busy for their tastes. They said the 328 isolated the driver from harsh road impacts better and that wouldnt make sense if the G35 is ""soft"". The media also agrees the G35 is a great value compared to its German rivals so I fail to see why its overpriced. Usually the cheaper car isnt called ""overpriced"". I agree the current C class is overpriced just like its BMW rival. The TL is a great value and the A4 is a value as long as its not compared to anything from Japan. You cant defend 3 series pricing and call its competitors overpriced when the 3 is one of the highest priced in the class.There are 4 sedans in this class with RWD and manuals: CTS, G35, 3 and C class.

And before you out there in this group respond to my post take a second to think about that first, please. There is not a single car in this class that is without fault. And there are seldom two drivers alike. For that there are a lot of options available. When one of the options does not meet your specific set of criteria that does not make it not an option. It merely means it is not a viable option for you. I go back to what I said before about sales of all the cars in the ELLPS category and BMW not having the majority of them.

"03accordman","March 2007"," "" am going to go out on a limb here - I have no real backing for my claim here. From reading the posts here and at various forums, I think that people who buy BMW have to justify to themselves that it is OK to overpay for drive/handling that a BMW is known for. They are also OK dealing with all the reliability problems that come with a BMW because, hey, all they care about is drive/handling. Now the moment someone tries to question that, it becomes a big deal since that is the primary reason they overpaid and was the fundamental basis of their decision.

You guys act like a dollar is a dollar. When you find something you really like, the money becomes secondary.

Plus when I was researching ED I read several horror stories about people waiting much longer than 1-2 months for their car...there are no guarantees regarding how long it will take for your car to arrive.So in practice even though the program is available to every buyer, it isn't at all practical for every buyer.

I had to shut it down at 145 mph when I ran out of raodway, but I am convinced that it would have gone up to 160 mph with a longer road. The car was very smooth and easy to handle at 145 mph and the suspension was perfect. The G35S comes with ""W"" speed rated tires (168 mph) so I would not recommend trying these speeds unless you verify your tire ratings.I have also taken the car too fast around a corner (intentionally) and I was very impressed with the smooth slide and easy handling and traction recovery of the car. I am sure that it is not impossible to loose control of this car, but you would have to work very hard or have some unusual circumstances to loose control of this vehicle.

Like those 1980s Motor Trend articles about which low priced cars give you the most performance per dollar. In this case, it seems most want luxury and some performance for the dollar.Others see value in pleasure. They feel their pleasure in a car is worth X cost. They may value things others do not care about or they may discount elements some take as necessary.eBay is a good example of personal valuation. Take two products that fulfill the same goal - like cell phones. Put them up for auction. One day you may get some nut who pays almost MSRP for a brand new Samsung SCH-U740. The other phone is a brand new Motorola V325 and it ends up selling for $100 less. Is that what the two products are worth? Well to the buyers, the products are worth at least that much because the bidding process found their personal valuations.I hear about people paying 50k for a 335i with active steering, premium package, automatic, sun shade, laser cruise and navigation and feel shocked. My personal valuation of such a car is significantly lower than a 335i with just the sport package and manual. I would consider the previous car only if it were sharply discounted - at least 6-7k less than my price of a 6mt ZSP version. BMW may mark the car at 50k; I'd mark it at 28k expressly because of the items on the car. My personal valuation is infinitely lower than the corporation's requested value. Neither side is right or wrong; we have differing views and thus will not find ourselves conducting a transaction on that product.So when you say a G35 is the budget alternative, it could be to you. To someone who values other things - less perceptible differences - the G35 may represent a compromise that distorts that individual's personal valuation. "

We can talk about subjective intangibles all day, but in the end you arent really giving up anything if you pass on the 3 series. The G35 has a better interior, slightly more room, lower price and likely superior reliability so I dont see any sacrifice. Sure, the G35 MAY come up short in a battle at the racetrack but I'm willing to bet most owners (even BMW owners) dont subject their car to that kind of environment.

"1487","March 2007"," For those that wont drive FWD cars its apparent they need to look in the ELS category for a car. If we put aside drive wheels and look at performance and features we find that many cars in this class seem overpriced compared to loaded ""regular"" cars. Of course a loaded Camry or Altima doesnt come with the same prestige as a luxury branded saloon so many people would much rather drive a base model A4 or 328 as opposed to a loaded non luxury car.I dont think fun to drive cars are limited to RWD so I wouldnt be pressed to buy a car in this class NEW unless I could comforably afford it. I would definitely get a used '08 CTS or G35 though. There is little value in luxury cars these days, especially since technology is racing to the lower end of the market like never before. Features that were luxury exclusives a few short years ago are now found on cars under $25k. Of course many will argue the extra money is worth it due to ""driving feel"" and ""things you only notice if you're a BMW owner"" and all that. Dont buy it.

"bruceomega","March 2007"," kdshapiro,"" ... I prefer AWD with the associated compromises in handling""For me and my own personal priorities, AWD is a requirement, not just a preference. About 4 years ago, when I bought my first ELLPS, and had AWD as a requirement, I only considered two choices, an Audi A4 quatro and a BMW 3 series Xi model. I did not like the interior of the G35x at all (new one is much nicer), I got the impression the Mercedes 4 matic C series was not very sporty, the small Jaguar AWD model had poor reviews, and I can't remember if there were any other choices.Today, there are more choices in AWD ELLPS cars, and the number of choices is growing, so that is a good thing from my perspective.I've had sporty cars in the past (Alfa Spyder, GTI, SHO), but was driving a 98 Accord V-6 coupe when I took a test drive in a previously owned 2001 BMW 330Xi. It took me all of about 2 microseconds to say wow, this is a completely different animal, and I bought it on the spot (have since traded it in on a 2006 330Xi).I would not have purchased a BWM if they only came in RWD, but I do understand the performance advantages of RWD (and owned many RWD cars earlier in my driving career). I have never driven a RWD BMW, but their handling must be something else as I am quite impressed with the handling of my 330Xi.Bruce "

If you want RWD than the G35 and IS can be had cheaper than a comparable 3 series.You also wrote: RWD isnt an essential feature for many car buyers. I'm talking luxury or technology features. You're making a value judgment right here. I agree that many buyers don't value RWD and a manual; I value it more than leather or bluetooth. Neither side is right or wrong. They're placing value on things I see as detractors to the value of a car. They're negating value at times with some features.The IS350 is worth less to me as a buyer - like my example of a loaded 335i - because it is outfitted with a transmission that retards my enjoyment of a car. How do I put a value on that? If RWD and manual fun has a baseline personal valuation of 35k to me, then how far does that drop an automatic equipped car? Well in my value system that makes the car pretty much unlivable. I would probably rather FWD and a manual before ever owning a car with an automatic; having driven the IS350, its automanual is one of the worst I've ever experienced on a car. So, I'd say a RWD car equipped with a bad automatic must be worth less than the absolutely cheapest new manual FWD car I'd own: a GTI. A GTI runs 24k. So figure 22-23k is my valuation of any IS350. Regardless of features or content beyond the RWD and manual, I know I won't live with a traditional automatic.Private valuation - we all have it. When we buy we've generally reconciled that our purchase meets a threshold where the cost to value is level in our heads. You expressed earlier that you don't see the value in ELLPS. Your private valuation of the group of vehicles is markedly less than the collected MSRPs and thus you will not strike a deal for one. "

NOt sure if that is a compliment to the vinyl or an insult to the leather!Also, TL has faux-carbon fiber trim which I think looks better than the faux-wood.

"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," disagree. True Delta puts zero weight on any features. It also fails to deduct value when a car lacks features. I ran an MKZ v. a 328i 6 MT ZSP and according to True Delta the MKZ was worth significantly more because it had worthless trinkets like memory seats and automatic transmission. Now, how could the MKZ's automatic tranny make the car worth more to a buyer who specifically rates it against a manual car? The MKZ lacks stability control, yet it was dinged for this, while the 3 was given $25 for having DSC. Stability control is only worth $25?! The MKZ lacks a sport package and again this didn't hurt the MKZ's pricing. Obviously, the buyer wants manual and sport packaging; the system refuses to weigh options based on user desires. Thus true delta's methodology is flawed. "

Given that Mrs. Shipo and I were already going to be taking a vacation to Europe at the time, and given that I would have otherwise had to spend a couple of thousand on a rental car (that would have been no where near as nice as the 5er), the cost of the 5er was even lower than the already inexpensive $550 per month. ;-)So, to echo your post, true, if kcleuk is shopping exclusively on price, then yes, a strippo ED 328i would be a screaming bargain compared to a high end Camry. ;-)Best Regards,Shipo "

Wow, can't argue with that...2 whole cars? :confuse: Why do you say it is second to Lexus, have you owned 3 of those that were bulletproof? :P Sorry, my friend. Reliability is about probability, the odds, what someone can expect when they buy a car based on what thousands of people have seen in real life. I'm happy for you that you got lucky with your 2 X Types, but that tells people next to nothing about the car's overall reliability. And once again you are completely wrong...the car has not steadily improved (in terms of reliability) since the 2002 year. According to consumer reports the 2003 model year was somewhat better (coming in at average reliability rather than much worse than average), but the 2004 year had MAJOR issues and the 2005 year looks even worse. Try again.Consumer Reports may have only ""tested"" the 2002 model, but that isn't why they say the X Type's reliability is crap. They compile information from many thousands of people like you who own the car....it isn't just an ""is your car reliable"" questionnaire, it is quite lengthy and asks very specific questions regarding what you have had to have fixed/replaced. According to the real life experience of thousands of folks, the X Type has had issues in the 2004 model with the drive system, transmission, power equipment, body hardware and body integrity...the 2005 model has had issues with all of those things PLUS issues with the electrical system and climate system. Based on the real life reliability of thousands of cars (not just your 2), I say that X Types are not reliable.People like me (who understand statistics) will shy away from the crappy X Type. Good luck, if you keep buying them the chances are great that you'll end up agreeing eventually. A crappy (93% worse than average) reliability rating doesn't mean that every single car will be a lemon, it means that your chances of having problems are MUCH GREATER than they are with a reliable car.I wouldn't trust Consumer Reports in their reviews of cars (when they drive them and make subjective ratings), and their way of compiling thousands of reliability responses may not be perfect, but they are one of the best source out there for reliability information. They aren't trashing your X Type, people suckered in with the factory incentives are. "
"alanroseman","March 2007"," I&#146;m new G35X owner. 2007, Obsidian black on Charcoal.As I just traded an X type I feel compelled to post on this subject.When I bought the X I was swayed by the AWD, not by the cost differential between it and the S-Type.All and any of the automobiles discussed here are very fine drivers, and pretty spiffy looking too.That said. The reliability factor doesn&#146;t really resonate with me and I&#146;m unsure why it&#146;s such a big deal to some of you folks. And, the X is a fun driver.The car is under warranty, when it screws up, the dealer repairs it. When you head to the dealer for repair, they hand you a loaner. What&#146;s the big deal?I really enjoyed my X type. Put 60K on it from new, had the usual Jag issues, but the dealer squared them away. Once the warranty expired I started looking for my next ride.In fact I looked at the X again, however, they no longer make a &#147;sport&#148; version. Stiff suspension, no chrome, black on black with black wood dash etc. Didn&#146;t enjoy the multi colored dash. Also, this is the last year of the X. I didn&#146;t want to own an AWD drive vehicle from Jag that was no longer in production.I drove the Beemer, Lexus, MB. CTS too. Last vehicle I drove was the G35. I can say the interior of the 2007 G35 played a role in my purchase. I looked at a 2006, and wouldn&#146;t have considered it based on the interior accoutrements alone. Just didn&#146;t have a center post that floated my boat. And, the G35 has HP and bottom to spare. I like a little flash in my powder tin.If it&#146;s reliability you seek, and that&#146;s a big issue. Look at the Corolla, and the Camry and don&#146;t forget the Civic either. Why are the Accord and Camry even mentioned here?When this one (G35X) hits 55k &#150; 60k, I&#146;ll begin my quest anew.Automobiles are something you&#146;ll own a series of throughout your life, they aren&#146;t a one and done.Cheers to all..

"habitat1","March 2007"," I have been a pretty staunch supporter of the BMW 3-series in spite of never owning one. I tested the 2004 330i ZHP, but ended up buying a TL 6-speed due to the combination of attributes it offered - and a back seat my kids could fit comfortably in. However, I thought the 330i ZHP, in spite of a 35hp deficit to the TL 6-speed, was clearly the better all around performer. And looked/felt good from the drivers seat.I had assumed the 335i was that much better, with significant increases in power. But it wasn't until this past Friday that I actually stopped in to the BMW dealership and took a close look at the new 335i coupe and sedan. Now I know what some are talking about with the interior. Gone is the ""cockpit"" feel of the older 3 series or M3's. Hell, my TL feels sportier sitting in the drivers seat. I still believe the 335i is the far and away performance leader for driving enthusaists in the ELLPS segment. But it has certainly lost its soul as far as the feel and look from the driver's seat. It feels bigger and far, far, far less driver oriented than the previous generation 4,000 lb M5.I guess this is blueguydotcom's opportunity to say ""I told you so"". All I can say is that I have never been more anxious to hop into my 911 and just look at the interior and enjoy the feel of the shifter before I turned on the ignition. I'll still be a defender of BMW driving dynamics - which are second to none in the ELLPS segment. But frankly, I couldn't buy the car on looks alone. I'm not sure what the heck I would do if I were in the market today. Buy a used M5, most likely. "

The ""X Type reliability is second only to Lexus"" is the FALSE statement I am referring to. If you want to say ""I recommend the X Type, I love mine, it's fun to drive, the AWD system is great, it's very luxurious, etc."" that's great.

I'll defend it to the end against the (poor handling, softly sprung, intstant-on braking, numb & overboosted steering) IS350 as well as the others in the ELLPS segment. But I couldn't put my money where my mouth is. In September '05 I came very close to leasing a low optioned E90 325i with Sports Package, Heated seats, & a Six Speed. After I drove the car, I just couldn't pull the trigger. The car had decent acceleration, rode rock solid on the highway, braked good, & handled very well. There was something missing. The dash wasn't very driver oriented and it didn't feel as connected to the road as other BMWs I've driven ('84 E30 325e, '95 E36 325is, '04 X5 3.0iA Sport, '05 E60 530iA).I knew the salesman as I'd negotiated 2 BMW leases for my parents the year before (the aforementioned X5 & 530). The lease rates were terrible at the time. He agreed to sell me the car at $1000 over invoice. I walked out and told him I'd think about it, then drove home in my '01 Honda Prelude Type SH. I couldn't do it. It wasn't worth it for me.

"brightness04","March 2007"," Interest is something that exists whether you finance (therefore pay) or have the money in the bank (therefore collect). I have never financed a car, always a cash buyer or taking advantage of lease deals.

"brightness04","March 2007"," Trading a cash bought car every few years like I have been doing is definitely a money losing proposition in the current environment. Keeping a car for 10 years is starting to make less sense too. For example, $30k in the bank earns an interest income of nearly $150/mo; leasing a 328i with ED costs only $277/mo with no cap reduction. How many months would it take for the $127/mo difference to add up to $30k that a cash buyer has to put down initially? hmm, 236 months, or close to 20 years! One has to keep the car well over a decade before it breaks even. I will chalk up lease inception cost and additional excise tax if any(not sales tax) against maintenance cost. There is no advantage in sales tax for buyer either because at $277/mo, it would take a decade to add up to $30k, which would also be taxable for a cash buyer.Financing is of course even worse off than cash buying as the bank usually charges higher interest than it pays out in interest, the number of which was used above.BTW, I know it's very odd.

A car at $277/mo lease should correspond to a real money market price of $18k or so not $34k! My excise tax bill under current tax code is nearly double what it should be. "

"jtla","March 2007"," Interest is something that exists whether you finance (therefore pay) or have the money in the bank (therefore collect). Absolutely, and the best of both worlds is lease-to-own. BMW's lease deals on 3-series are so attractive that everyone should lease even if he/she intends to buy. Current money factor with 7 MSD for 328i is 0.00076(0.00125 - 0.00007*7) which is equivalent to an interest rate of 1.8%. Whether you pay cash or finance, an estimated 4% interest rate difference on a $40k car for 3 year would be around $3,800 (not $4,800 because the depreciated portion of car cost has been repaid through lease payment). If you purchase the car at lease-end, it is like you are getting additional $3,800 discount; if you return the car at lease end, not only do you save $3,800 in interest, you also save, say, 7% of sales tax on the residual value -- another $1,700 or so. The cost of the $5,500 potential saving? $625 lease acquisition fee plus approx. $500 ""lost interest"" of your 7 MSD. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Out here in Taxachusetts, we have to pay 5% sales tax on each payment, then every year there is an excise tax of 2.5% of ""table value""; the ""table value"" is 90% of MSRP in the model year, 60% MSRP MY-1 and MY+1, 40% MSRP MY+2, 25% MSRP MY+3 and 10% MSRP MY+4 and thereafter. As you can see, the tax code severely penalize cars that heavily discount from MSRP. It becomes a big deal when between ED and high residual, the consumer is only paying about 13% of MSRP worth of depreciation over two years (little over 6% each year); the excise tax adds as much as 25-35% to the first year's payment because of the inflated MSRP!On the surface of it 5% + 2.5% is no big deal, not much more than the 7% in CA, but the real difference is that the 5% and 7% are assessed on payments, in other words the total tax base over the two years is only 13% of the car's MSRP (depreciated value, interest is negligible in these subsidized leases), whereas the tax base of the 2.5% excise tax is 150% of MSRP in the same two years. "
"habitat1","March 2007"," Careful on the lease analysis vs. cash buy analysis. What makes the most economic sense is dependent upon your own personal ""money factor"" compared to the leasing companies, as well as what they claim the residual value is vs. what you think the depreciation will be. And, of course, what the capitalized cost is compared to the best negotiated cash price.BMW is known to have aggressive lease terms and I have not done a direct comparison. But my personal money factor is 3.5% (I can margin borrow at 6% and the interest is effectively tax deductable from my other investment earnings). That is not the case for many or most people, but I know of others who took out home equity loans at 5.5%-6.5% that were fully tax deductable interest. In the case of my 911, I compared the best lease deal I could get to my own ""self financed"" purchase deal and the difference was enormous - to the tune of $21,000 over 48 months. I am sure the difference would be a closer with a 335i, but i'm willing to bet that for those that can effectively borrow at an after tax rate of under 4%, it still is more expensive to lease than buy. There is no voodoo in leasing economics - you are adding another party to the equation and they need to make money. Unless they can give me funds at under 4%, they will be making it at my expense - even without their little acquisition and dispositon fees. "

My calculation based on:- $28,415 ED invoice for base 328i sedan 6MT no option- $1,000 dealer profit + $625 lease fee- zero cap cost reduction- single security deposit- 2 yr / 12k miles lease- MF .00125 + 0.0003 for ED- 73% residualThe payment for the above should be in the neighborhood of $330 before tax ($355 with 7.75% sales tax).

For me, frankly, aside from the four laps around Nurburg, shopping the car and getting a good deal is the most fun I will derive from it. I drive 3-5 miles every second or third day, and a typical 40-80 mile trip once or twice a week, half of it at the beginning of a frenetic day with gazillions of things on my mind, and the other half at the end of a long day when I'm really tired. Most driving on public roads is a chore to me, and I leave it to my employees whenever I can (not enough). "
"habitat1","March 2007"," ""BMWFS' money factor on most 3ers is under 4% (2 or 3 years lease term), with max MSD can be under 2%."" Interesting - maybe you or blueguy can explain how they can afford to do that in the long term. I suspect their own cost of funds is in the 5% range. So either they are lowballing residual values, giving less of a discount to MSRP on leased cars, bumping fees, or some other method. I doubt they are operated as a ""loss center"" (vs. profit center) for BMW, but who knows with those wacky Germans. Or perhaps it's the ""Euro carry trade"" or subprime lending scheme that has yet to be uncovered by Wall Street. P.S. Porsche's lease rates are a lot less friendly. Money factor of around 7.4%. And if you would like to pick up the car at the factory, they'll charge you $3k+ for that priviledge rather than give you a fat discount. Coming, going and in-between, they know ""there is no substitute"" and price it accordingly. "

All of this ""Car x isnt really a better deal because I dont care about the features it offers"" isn't going to work. Whenever people dont like a certain vehicle that offers better value people want to discount the features on that vehicle. There is no point in having a luxury car if you want to skimp on the options. I'm not going to compare cars of different classes because its apparent that midsize sedans in 2007 are far better absolute values than entry luxury sedans.The fact of the matter is that on a feature for your dollar basis several cars in this class are better than the 3 series. If people chose to pay more to get less because they refuse to drive anything other than the 3 series that is their choice.

That isnt the same as ""flawed methodology"" at all. Lacking an option will not penalize a car and thus the MKZ isnt going to suffer for not having something that isnt standard on the 3 series. The site takes into account features that are STANDARD on one model but are optional or not available on the other model. Thats the whole point of the price comparisons on the site. The 3 series would only get a price ""credit"" vs the Lincoln if the sport package was standard. The site is pretty thorough and more useful than other conventional pricing sites. "
"quasiactuary","March 2007"," ""Hate to tell you this - but I don't shop for cars based on statistics. I do it the old fahioned way - I go test drive all the ones that interest me. Reliability is not a big factor to me personally, because the local dealer is excellent and the latest cat is equipped with the factory 7year-100k warranty + free loaner car if I need one. The Jag dealer even came and rescued me when my Chevy pickup expired on the interstate this winter. Your statistics won't tell you if the grandkids won't fit in the back seat, if your luggage won't fit in the trunk, or if the damn car is a hand full when it snows or pours rain here in the mountains. Incentives didn't sucker me in, as you imply - didn't even know about them until I'd already decided to buy the first one. As an senior engineer, formerly with GM, and now with a fortune 75 auto parts supplier, you sound more like a troll than a statistician. ""If ""reliability is not a big factor"" to you personally, why did in your original post list the X Type's reliability as a selling point? In fact, it sounded like the strongest selling point you listed. Just from memory (so I apologize in advance if I leave something out) you said it was quick, good handling, had reliability second only to Lexus, and came standard with AWD, a 3.0 V6, and leather. Every car in this segment could be called quick, many are quicker than the X Type...every car in this segment has been called ""good handling"" by someone...even you seem to have conceded the ""second only to Lexus"" false statement...AWD is an important option to some, but hardly unique to the X Type...a 3.0 V6 is bigger (maybe better) than what is in some, smaller (maybe worse) than others...and every car in this segment has leather as an option, only BMW doesn't make it standard. So the ""second only to Lexus in reliability"" statement really stood out to me, and is NOT TRUE.Buying a car based on something other than statistics and logic is fine, just don't try to convince people they should buy an unreliable car because it is has ""reliabilty second only to Lexus"" based on the 2 you have owned. By the way, I see that you aren't defending that quote.And nice strawman argument, you sound like a troll. I never said that you shouldn't test drive cars....never said statistics would tell you everything. But as a statistician (actuary really, but quite similar) I will tell you while a test drive is absolutely essential (in my opinion) in choosing a car, a 15 minute test drive will NOT tell you anything about a car's reliability unless the car happens to break down on you...and a sample size of 2 cars will NOT tell you anything about a car's reliability (other than the fact that the auto maker CAN make at least 2 reliable cars).As a former senior engineer with GM would you have tested only 2 cars coming off of an assembly line and deemed that enough to tell you everything was kosher? At your fortune 75 auto parts supplier would you only test 2 of your parts to be sure they work? Would you tell the people who buy your auto parts not to worry about the part's reliability because you guys have a warranty...if the part is defective and leaves them stranded they can always return it for another part? I'm guessing that both GM and your current employer do massive amounts of testing and worry constantly about quality/reliabilty of their products. "

"fedlawman","March 2007"," ""I don't think anyone has ever explained how Acura's TL can even be considered as an ELLPS.""Actually I agree with you Joe, but not in the way you're thinking.I believe that the entire ""ELLPS Segment"" has changed since this thread was created many moons ago. In 2002, the cars that were in this class were the E46, C-Class, A4, TL (Gen 3), IS300. These cars averaged about 200 HP and were, I believe, in a different class than the current breed. When the TSX came out in 2003, it compared very favorably to the 325i, C-Class, and A4 1.8T in size, HP, features, and performance.The cars listed here now, on the other hand, are pushing 300 HP, are loaded with features, and are softer and heavier - more like the mid-level luxury cars from 5 years ago (E39, M35, A6). This segment is no longer ""entry-level"" if you ask me.I believe the ELLPS segment we have here should remain ""as is"" because it is so well established, but a new class of cars is on the horizon - the ""up-and-comers"" as I like to call them.The UAC segment is basically the ""new"" ELLPS segment and includes cars such as the TSX, A3, and (soon to be sold here) BMW 1-Series. This is a group of cars sold by a ""luxury marque"" that appeals to younger, up-and-coming professionals who want sporty luxury, but aren't ready to spend $40,000 on a car. The UAC segment offers less performance and fewer features than the ELLPS segment, yet more prestige and sportier dynamics than a CamCord (exactly what this segment used to be).I once was a customer in the ELLPS segment, and I am still a passionate follower of this class of cars - even though they no longer appeal to me as a potential purchase anymore. They have grown too ""midsize"" for my tastes. Today, I would sooner purchase an RX-8 or a used E46 than one of these overweight leviathans. "
"wale_bate1","March 2007"," Good observations and well put, fedlawman.Precisely my thoughts; the class has outgrown itself and the replacement class is much more at what ELLPS really is.Of course, that may have something to do with the smaller, lighter (well, somewhat), nimbler, and more driving-oriented the new class is...

"1487","March 2007"," Regardless of who said what, it doesnt make sense when you think about the vehicles being compared here.

For some it is.But if all that mattered was features for the dollar, then Porsche would be out of business tomorrow.

It's a great car but in my opinion it's a different type of car for a different type of buyer. Sure, many on here differ completely in their stance on a lot of the cars we critique here. But to me what we consider ELLPS on here are vastly different from the GS350. Some on here would argue (and they are entitled to do so) that some (if not most) of the ELLPS are not true performers. But when every car on that list above has above avg acceleration, above avg handling, and above avg braking they should all be considered above avg performers. I think that's an extremely reasonable statement. I find the GS350 to be more refined than the cars in the ELLPS class. And that's not a bad thing. It's a gorgeous car inside and out. It's very comfortable. It's got a boatload of creature comforts at your fingertips. And it's got outstanding acceleration. But from there to me it's handling and braking lag the avg of this class and that takes it's fun to drive factor down a bit from the avg ELLPS. Which is not to say the car is entirely not fun to drive. If the car fits your needs (as it did my fiance's) and you can afford it then go for it.

Friend of mine is seriously considering one (GS450h, I think), but he and his wife are far more interested in luxury than a sporty drive. He currently has a 1999 +/- GS300 that, although pretty slow and soft by current standards, has been absolutely bulletproof and still looks nice. For him, the new GS would be a big jump up in driving pleasure, without giving up the Lexus luxury they have become accustomed to.Only thing I might suggest if you are jumping up to the GS price range and size, and are O.K. with RWD, would be to investigate the new 535i. I don't know if/when it will be available, but it would be the sporty alternative to the GS. Edmunds doesn't have much info, but I saw some pricing info posted in another forum. Buying or leasing a BMW through ED makes them a lot more price competitive than most people realize, if you are up for going through the process. Good luck and keep in touch.  "

Your car's transportation cost is the same as if you picked up in the USA - $775 now, was $95. You pick up the car at the ED center, which is two blocks from a train stop so it's an easy walk. From there you can go directly to the re-delivery drop off a a few miles away or you can drive around Europe and drop off at a variety of locations. The car is shipped with the rest of the new BMWs heading to the USA. When your car arrives your dealer will PDI it as if it were new and call you to come get your new/old car.Length of trip varies. If you're on the east coast it's pretty common to get the car in 3, 4 weeks tops. Mine took 6 weeks to get to San Diego. "

That said, to them ED orders are like ""Found Money"" as ED cars don't come out of their allocation but do count toward gaining future allocations.-All of the paperwork shy of a few bits that are signed at delivery are signed at your local dealership.-As a general rule, you cannot use a proxy to fetch your car.

ALl you have to do is read any car mag or online site comparison to see this is the ONLY real way to compare vehicles. If you use subjective criteria to determine which features are valid and which are silly you cannot compare cars objectively. Generally speaking, cars with more stuff for your money are considered better values. This isnt something I have made up by any means. I never said that every car buyer makes a purchase based on value, but value exists nonetheless. No one can argue that a 911 is a better value than the Vette but some people feel the 911 is worth the premium even though they know its not better on value alone. "

Most midsizers in this class are about 190 inches long and weigh about 3600lbs. The compacts are about 10 inches shorter and weigh 3400lbs or more. The compact A4 is heavier than some midsize luxury cars so you cannot always associate length with curb weight.

"fedlawman","March 2007"," ""I am not alone in believing that features and performance per dollar is a measure of value.""Well then, for people who feel this way, a BMW is not a good choice. But how do you and others ever justify spending more than $20,000 on a new car? The $33,000 G35 is a poor value when compared to the $30,000 Nissan Maxima. The Maxima has the same engine, TWO sunroofs, leather, HID's, Bose premium audio, power/heated seats, etc. 90% of drivers will rarely if ever drive a car hard enough to tell the difference in performance/handling anyways, right?Compared to the $27,000 Altima, the $30,000 Maxima is a poor value. The Altima with Premium Package (moonroof, fog lights, rear spoiler, heated leather seats, HomeLink, auto-dimming inside rearview mirror, compass, etc.) has the same engine as the G35 and Maxima, is sporty and fun to drive, and it includes most of the luxury goodies too.But as long as we're talking value here, why not consider the $23,000 Hyundai Sonata Limited? Now here's a car that includes a powerful V6 (more HP than a BMW 328i), double wishbone/multi-link suspension with sway bars, and all the luxury and safety features that the Altima (with leather package) has. I doubt if most people could tell the difference in driving dynamics between the Sonata and the G35 during their typical commute.Is the G35's RWD, HIDs, and surround-sound audio system worth $10,000? Not to me, it isn't. "
"fedlawman","March 2007"," ""If you use subjective criteria to determine which features are valid and which are silly you cannot compare cars objectively.""I can and do use subjective criteria.I test-drove the E90 and thought it was the most dynamic and fun driving car in this class. I test-drove the G35 30 minutes later and thought the throttle response was sluggish, the clutch was grabby, the steering was overboosted, and the ride was too isolated.All subjective observations which made the $33,000 G35 a ""poor value"" in my book. "
"louiswei","March 2007"," Well, since this is only a static display so don't fault me on not incorporating the ""performance"" and ""handling"" part into the discussion.Went to the Atlanta Auto Show over last weekend and pretty much spent at least 10 minutes in every ELLPS that was on the floor. I went with 2 buddies of mine, buddy A drives a 06' G35 coupe and buddy B will be looking for an ELLPS in about 2 years. So buddy A and me took the opportunity to give him some pointers about the current ELLPS market. Acura TL: still has the best looking interior in class in my opinion, even though I recently found out that Acura uses fake wood and carbon fiber. The quad exhaust was a nice touch on the TL-S but standard rims could use some steroid treatment. I did find a serious flaw in TL's interior though. The handle on the door panel was made out of rubber and one can easily twist it by applying some force to it. This may not be a big deal to some but to an interior [non-permissible content removed] like me could very well be the deal breaker. This indeed is another cost-cutting evidence from Acura.Audi A4: Nothing to report here, same old interior as my friend's 2002 A4. Good fit and finish but lame in style.BMW 3-series: My buddies and I all agree that BMW has one of the best interior materials in this class along with Lexus but the style really belongs in the 90'. There was a pre-owned E46 parked right besides an E90 and we all agree that the former has a better interior style-wise.Caddy CTS: The new 2008 CTS was on the display ramp with a ""Do Not Touch"" sign to it. From a distance the interior looks great, good body style as well. I must say I am really impressed with this honest effort from Caddy. However, it does look substantially larger than all other ELLPS (including the TL) so to me this is really a 5-series fighter. I was curious about the material Caddy used for the lower part of the door panel so I asked one of the Caddy representatives to see if I can touch it. She told me it's the same material used on the current CTS and then led me to one of them. After inspecting the current CTS I was surprised that the lower door panel was actually made out of soft plastic. Even though it's one of those ""spongy"" type of plastic instead of the hard rubber kind on IS, it is still WAY better than the hard plastic that Infiniti uses on their G35. Score one for Caddy here. However, the current CTS interior still looks like crap to me regardless of materials.Infiniti G35: Much improved from the old model but cost-cutting evidence like hard plastics still makes it inferior to its competitor interior-wise. Still don't understand why the control buttons are facing up instead of the driver or at least forward. I was mocking buddy A about not waiting for the new one and after seeing it in person now he is seriously thinking about trading in his 06' for one of the 08's. Again, love the washi aluminum trim. Lexus, are you listening?Lexus IS: Nothing to add here, best interior in class in fit-and-finish and material used. Second in style only to the TL. Would like to see the metallic trim replace by aluminum during mid-life upgrade but I wouldn't hold my breath to it. Rear seat space is no doubt the smallest among this pack.M-B C-lass: Nothing to write home about, solid effort for an entry-level luxury car. Doesn't appear to be better than 3er and IS IMO. Since this is an outgoing model I am much more interested in the new 08' C-class.After the ""tour of ELLPS"", buddy B thinks TL is the best fit for him. He loves bigger space, doesn't need (ok, want) class-leading power and is not much of an enthusiast. However, that could very well change when it's time for him to make a decision but now TL is definitely the front runner. "
"wale_bate1","March 2007"," There seems to be, and rightly so, IMO, some debate here on what exactly the ELLPS class comprises.

They view it as a station wagon which means a 30K car costs less to insure than your average 20K car (of course some of that probably has to do with Audi's excellent safety), but most is probably due to station wagons having a history of being driven by conservative drivers.

"1487","March 2007"," A V8 powered 540 weighs considerably more than an IS300 or 325i. Teh difference is probably around 500lbs which is significant. Compare the weight of the G35 or CTS (which is kind o heavy) to the 3 series. The difference isn't that large, especially between the G35 and 3. Same goes for TL and 3 series. A couple hundred pounds between the cars at most. "
"wale_bate1","March 2007"," That weight was also accompanied by a beefier supension, more power, bigger rubber, bigger brakes and all items aimed at equalizing the experience. Point is a bigger car can be made as sporting as possible and still not have the joyous feel of a compact. "

Cars arent great investments (contrary to what resale value addicts say) and if I can get the features I want in a non luxury brand and save thousands I will do so. In 2007 a $25k family sedan can run 0-60 faster than a 330iA which is pretty impressive. A few years back 6 speeds were only found in top end luxury cars and now they are found in Jettas and Auras.

"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," 330i is a 2006 model. Jetta GLI as far back as 2002 had a 6 speed. FWIW, you can buy used luxury cars and save thousands too. We bought a 30k msrp Audi last week for 8k off sticker. The car's perfect, only has 12k miles on it and remaining 4 yr/50k warranty. We paid less than we would have plunked down for an 07 Accord EX-L V6 (the 4 cylinder is so grossly underpowered it's not even close to equivalent). You like BMWs? Consider a 2006 325/330i at the end of 07. The 330is will be down around 30k (they're selling in the low 30s right now) and the 325is sub 25k by then for certain. I've already seen lightly used 2006 325is with premium/auto for 26k.I do agree about pricing for most of the cars. But once I drive a RWD vehicle I know that's worth a big chunk of dough over a bland FWD midsize car. "

Honestly, the 3 series is pulling 69-70 mph through the slalom and almost .9gs. Look at the numbers of an 06/07 Miata and Mini. They're not pulling any better but they are major compromises. And the A3 weighs 3200-3300 lbs. That 300-400 difference is night and day from an IS350, G35, TL, A4, etc. You feel it the moment you accelerate, turn, brake. "
"bruceomega","March 2007"," It's been interesting following the comments on size and interior room for ELLPS cars.I'm 6' tall, with long legs, and fortunately I find the driver's seat on my 2006 330Xi (and previous 2001 330Xi) has quite alot of front to back travel- I can move it far enough back to be comfortable and that always impressed me about the 3 series. But when I put the seat back like that, there is very little leg room in the rear- I myself could not fit back there, not sure a child could.If it's just the two of us, my wife and I, then that is a non issue. If we have an occasional passenger or two, then its not a problem to temporarily move the front seats forward.But, we now have my Mother-In-Law living with us for about 5 months out of the year. She is getting on in years, not as agile as she used to be, and its hard for her to get into the 330Xi back seat. So, when my MIL is with us, we drive my wife's X3 most of the time as its roomier inside and has easier ingress and egress (even though its just about the same length and width as the 330Xi). Same thing when we have other family members or friends riding with us for other than a short hop- usually take the X3.Being curious about interior space, in case I were ever to get another sedan, I sat in several cars at the DC Auto Show a few months ago to try them on for size. When possible, I would move the driver's seat back far enough for my long legs, then try to sit in the back seat on the driver's side.The G35 was no better than the 3 series in the rear. Front seat felt a little more confining.The IS-250/350 was worse in the back, but I didn't mind the front.The TL was roomier.The CTS was roomier.Bruce "

Two extra doors might add 50 lbs of curb weight, if that. Hardly a big deal in my book. Beyond styling differences (not every car looks better with two doors) a sedan and coupe version of the same car are largely the same. I dont have problem with RWD although I fail to see why a RWD has to cost more. BTW, as we've already noted there are RWD cars available for less money comparably equipped than the 3 so I dont see why people are saying ""the 3 is worth a premium because its RWD"".

That ""Mondeo"" myth began after one of Jag management types mentioned at a press conference early on that the X shared some parts with Mondeo.

"oldcem","March 2007"," Sorry to disagree. I've communicated on the Jag forums with people in Great Britian who actually own both cars. They indicate that there's a very substantial difference in the two. Besides if you do a little research you'll find that only 20% of Mondeo made it into the X. The chassis didn't make it, the brake parts and some belly pan stampings did. The 3.0 European X without the damn electronic limiter will do 150 according to the British drivers. Mine will only hit 121 before the limiter kicks in. The 3.0 liter Jag engine actually makes the same HP and torque as the BMW 3.0 in the new 328I. The Jag's a bit heavier and has AWD, so the 5 speed models hit 60 in 6.5 seconds. My 5 speed automatic takes 7.1. Forget the Mondeo reskin nonsense, its a myth.

Edmunds also reviewed the X Type wagon (3.0, automatic) and indicated that its performance was very good, comparable to sedans in this class. However their review of the sedan indicated that performance was subpar to similar sedans. Whoops, the sedan is a good bit faster to 60 than the wagon is.

In addition, I know for a fact that the suspension and brakes in my 06 are substantially different from those in my old 03 model, because I do my own midpoint oil changes and tire rotations. The suspension members and the brake calipers are even differnt now. I suspect as part of Jags ongoing improvements. You also forget - the Mondeo was a front driver, the X is AWD with a huge driveshaft running the length of the car, equipped with a center bearing. Most power goes to the rear differential, unless slippage is detected, then it starts shifting to the front diff. Go look under one if you think I'm yanking your chain - I've been doing a lot of my own wrenching on these cars. Regards:OldCEM "

Yeah, the Mondeo chassis that's the basis for the car made RWD impossible. ""One significant design element is that all X-Types will be equipped with standard all-wheel drive-a Jaguar first. This stems from the fact that the X-Type shares certain platform components with the new Europe-only Ford Mondeo, which is a front-drive car.

The platform of the new Jag can be traced to that of the Ford Mondeo, a compact sedan not sold in the U.S. With that chassis came the X-Type&#146;s MacPherson strut front suspension, with the bushings, springs, shocks, etc., and the geometry customized for the Jaguar, as was the steering.

"jtla","March 2007"," Well, some cost components were missing in your calculation. I will copy and paste my post #9147 again:... two items were missed in your example: $695 destination charge and $625 lease inception fee (assuming rolled-in). My calculation based on: - $28,415 ED invoice for base 328i sedan 6MT no option - $1,000 dealer profit + $625 lease fee - zero cap cost reduction - single security deposit - 2 yr / 12k miles lease - MF .00125 + 0.0003 for ED - 73% residual Using lease calculator from leaseguide.com the monthly payment comes to $354.55 with 7.75% sales tax. The March price bump probably adds $2 or $3 to the payment.In addition, doing ED for a base model may not worth it because there is not that much price gap with US prices, especially nowadays you can get the 328i for around $500 over invoice at local dealers. When you factor in the travel cost for ED and one month payment without your car (overall 2 months without car but BMWFS pays for the second month), the true monthly cost is about $400/month, which you can get from dealer lots without too much haggle.Again, I agree that the 328i lease deal is very attractive, but it can't be had for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction. IMO, the $123 (44%) difference is significant for cost comparison purpose. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," Agreed. A nicely loaded 335i is the best deal for ED. You get a cut on every option you add so your base is actually further from the car's msrp and thus closer to the vehicle's residual value. "

That's a sizable difference considering the vanishingly small base numbers that we are talking about :-) "
"brightness04","March 2007"," I doubt a fender bender on a BMW would cost less, unfortunately. The last time I took my 5 series in (three cars before my current cars), the body shop guys literally had dollar signs in their eyes. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," Yes, all ED MF's are boosted by 0.0003. Of course, BMW pays for month two of the lease. Any jump in cost is offset by the payment. I think the boost in MF has more to do with lining the pockets of dealers. "

"brightness04","March 2007"," Sales tax is something different from state to state, and something you can not avoid even if buying a Sonata (probably far worse for buying Sonata because you'd have to pay sales tax on the whole car). Same goes with destination charge. The average maitenance cost on a Sonata probably exceeds $800 every two years, so there's no point counting lease inception charge either. I never roll either fees into lease payment. Nor should they, or tax, be counted if we want an apples to apples comparison. Of course, personally I agree with you that a loaded car is even better deal with ED; personally nothing short of a 335i convertible is really worth my time taking the trip (I'm actually planning on picking up two cars to make flying the Mrs worth it) . . . but we have to compare the cheapest deals avaiable just for the sake of argument.Delivery time for east coast is one month, and BMWFS pays for that one month. $400/mo is worse deal than what BMW advertises on its own website. I'm sure if you are willing to over-pay, say $100,000 for a Sonata, the dealer won't haggle with you much either ;-) "

It is indeed cheaper to get a 3 series than getting a Sonata. I'm making that business decision precisely because a 3 series is cheaper to keep for a couple years than a Corolla or Civic! May as well give my employees a little incentive that doesn't cost me any extra, actually saving a few pennies even after counting the trip cost, which makes the European trip tax-writable.As for whether cost is relevent, if someone wants to disqualify TSX on cost ground, we may as well examine what the real costs are for the other entries.

"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," I've become accustomed to not paying for anything but my car payment and tires in regard to maintenance.

"jtla","March 2007"," You may choose to pay destination charge, lease inception fee, and sales tax up front instead of by monthly payment, but these costs still exist. Similarly, there is travel expenses involved, even if you have one million frequent flyer miles. The bottom line is, the true monthly cost to lease a 328i for 2 yr/12k mile is approx. $370 before tax, $400 after tax.IMHO, saying that one can lease a 328i for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction, and thus a better deal than a Sonata is like false advertising. You would need to add fine print as (1) $2,100 up front cost to cover destination charge, lease inception, and sales tax; (2) $900 in travel expenses to Munich to pick up your car. Total $3,000 divided by 24 is $125. Add that to $277 you get $402.Speaking of ad, the deal on BMW website is $329/mo with $2,500 down payment. It includes auto transmission ($1,210 option) but only 10k miles per year (1% residual difference), the effect to payment is about a wash. The true monthly cost is about $400 before tax. My example in previous post is $400 after tax. "

"brightness04","March 2007"," Destination charge, lease inception vs. maitenance cost and sales tax all exist even if you decide to buy a Sonata. The $23000 MSRP suggested included none of that.

The case is not even close. Not sure why you even bother debating me on this. Even if you tag on another $50/mo to fatten the dealer, do you believe a 2-year old Sonata can sell for $16750? The number is the same if you insist on $400/mo but wipe off the Euro trip allowance of $1150 above. Like I said, the numbers are not even close; why do you even bother to debate me on this? Frankly if you insist on $400/mo, we should recaculate and use MSRP+$5000 for the Sonata as apparently the hypothetical consumer is fond of paying more than the manufacturer suggested price. "

Heck, I will even let you mark up 10%.  "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," You're totally ignoring your other costs so you can arrive at a fallacious magic number. The fact is a BMW lease is going to add on the $625 acquisition fee, 1 month payment without use of the car, cost to retrieve car and cost to replace car after only 22 months in service. These costs cannot be ignored if you're performing any real cost analysis. Over the course of 24 months even at your fake $300 a month rate (multiplied by 23), you're looking at:Lease cost $6900 (but only 22 months of use)Extra cost: $625Retrieval cost: $1200 (bare minimum as there's also transportation costs in Munich)Tire replacement cost: $1000 (with 30k miles there's no way the car's RFTs will be in good enough shape to return the car with same shoes)9725/22 months of use = $442 per month and the other two months you will have to pay for something else...Add in gas expenditures too! A 328i can reasonably get 21 mpg combined using 2008 standards. 15k miles / 21 mpg = 714 gallons per year. Premium gas is at least $3 a gallon. That's $2142 per year on just gas. "

"brightness04","March 2007","  I simply answered a rhetoric question by stating that I would pick a 328i over a $24k Sonata on pure cost consideration, because leasing a 328i would cost a lot less than paying $24k for a Sonata. If you don't care about Sonata and more importantly can't be bothered with simple arithmatics, you should have thought through before accusing me of anything. 328i can be leased at sub-$300/mo without any capital reduction. Every lease comes with acquisition fee; tax, title, insurance and gas are extra for any car, lease or purchase . . . almost all cars excepting BMW's also incurr maintenance expense. There is nothing misleading about it. I don't waste my time in business where my markup is only 10%.

"louiswei","March 2007"," I don't know about you hauss, I was actually enjoying the ""3-series vs. the world debate"". :PAs matter of fact, I'll start a little ""3-series vs. All-other-ELLPS debate"" myself. Note: this is coming from a non-enthusiast (at least not about tracking the car) and interior nut's point of view. Oh, by the way, this will also NOT be a price independent discussion.3er vs. TL: drawTL has the class-leading design in interior and best value in class but it's FWD. 3er has a not-so-desirable interior but is good in power and handling with the RWD advantage. This could go either way depend on how important is the FWD/RWD criteria to the buyers.3er vs. A4: 3erAudi A4 is outdated, underpowered and overweight. The only advantage it held over 3er is the better looking interior but that, also looks like it belongs in the last generation which the A4, uh..., is.3er vs. CTS (current): 3erHands down 3er in this case. The only advantage the Caddy has is the bigger interior space but to me that is mute since we are talking about ELLPS instead of midsize sedan here. Not going to comment about the 08' CTS since it is not yet available and details are still waiting to be revealed.3er vs. G35: G35G35 has better value, nicer looking interior, rock-solid handling and one of the top engines in this segment. The engine does not have the ""kick"" that the twin-turbo 6 in the 335i has but is decent enough. With the comparable equipped G35S and 335i having a price difference around $6-8K (MSRP, let's not go to that ED discussion here again please) I'll take that over 0.5 seconds faster in 0-60 any given day. Only thing lacking in the G35 is the inferior material used inside the cabin.3er vs. IS350: IS350IS350 has a good interior, better in design than 3er and materials used are equally good if not better. It's engine might not be as ""torquey"" as the twin-turbo 6 in the low RPM region but is the only one that could hang with it in this segment. To me, I couldn't notice much difference between the 2 with the IS350 on ""power ECT mode"". I am pretty sure a few tenth of a second difference is there but unless one is in a drag race that is really a non-issue. The comparable equipped IS350 is about $2-3K lower than the 3er so the value factor is still there if one must. The only disadvantage for the IS350 is its more isolated steering and not-as-sharp handling.3er vs. C-class: 3erThe current C-class is outdated, over-priced so this one goes to 3er hands down. I doubt if the new C could fair better since we know it's a M-B that means it will be over-priced. Also, even the new C350 is considered ""under-powered"" in today's ELLPS segment. "
"1487","March 2007"," Thanks for clearing that up! "
"brightness04","March 2007"," The factory original tires usually last between 30-35k miles for me. On the other hand the brakes wear out between 20-30k. My current car had to replace the brakes at 21k miles, at a cost of $990, an expense that would have been avoided with BMW's, regardless leasing or buying.22.5mo vs. 23mo is only 2% difference, quite immaterial. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Very much in agreement with your assessment on the vehicles themselves. The value issue however gets very murky nowadays. I am actually picking the 3 series over TL and G35 on pricing alone. The extra volume of TL and G35 actually would have been nice in our case, but the price is what sells. Even witout ED, the high residual and low money factor actually make the 3 series cheaper than TL and G35, or at least comparable in the case of TL. Let's not forget, over 80% of new 3 series are leased, and a vanishingly small per centage of people pay MSRP even if they buy. So the pricing issue is much trickier than just looking at MSRP.For what it's worth, I actually did a cost analysis over 6 year period (cars more than 6 years old are crap shoots, or at least have the ""luxury"" and ""sport"" squeezed out of them). Having three brand new 3 series over 6 years beats having 1 TL, 2 TL, 3 TL or 1 G35, 2 G35, 3 G35 over the same 6 year projection hands down in dollars and cents alone. Shorter assessment periods would make BMW's margin of victory in this low-cost race even greater because the maintenance cost is paid by the manufacturer for the first 4 years. "

"hauss","March 2007"," 1487, I'm not a 3er fan myself. I still contend that if it were far and away the best choice in this class it would have far greater market share than it does. It does have the largest market share among the ELLPS (and I'm not counting the coupes and convertibles they sell just the sedans) but not by a landslide. It's more like a few percentage points. If you add up all the other ELLPS sales the 3er is not the choice of vehicle for roughly 4 out of 5 ELLPS buyers. You just need to take your argument to them in a different way. For example, when they tell you things such as features are subjective then remind them that feel is subjective too. When the argument turns to value remind them that while a good chassis and suspension come at a cost so to do luxury features. Just as they cannot do without a certain enthusiastic ride other buyers cannot do without feature content. For everyone that likes their cars small there are those that require more size and space. Finally, we can still argue, I think, the athleticism component too. We can easily dig up information that shows other cars besting the 3 series over the years in performance metrics such as acceleration, handling, and braking. While the 3 series usually performs well in those tests it does not always finish first in all of them. Let's use these type of arguments to stir up the debate. I think you'll find that many people aren't all that enamored with BMW's product. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," You are certainly correct on the rear seat volume. The use I have in mind for these cars doesn't involve rear seat passengers. Being a mid-size car, G35 has significant advantage in trunk space, and especially the way it is accessed. That extra 9"" car length was put to good use there. I know, it's a bit odd talking about trunk space, but hey, we all have real life requirements. If not for real life requirement, the driving enthusiasts among us would be looking at Miata or Z4 instead of a relatively porky 4-door. But, like I said, it's not a deal killer, with the discounting from BMWFS that I'd be getting, my employees will just have to put up with the occasional trunk loading difficulties, or even put some of the bigger pieces of equipment in the empty back seat for all I care; who knows, they might even be eager to do that if it means a car with the blue propeller on the hood :-) "

"thechoson","March 2007"," The first car in this segment I got to drive for an extended time was the 06 325i, which I rented last year for a weekend trip down to San Diego from LA.My everyday drivers had been a Maxima and Civic, so this BMW blew me away. I can't really describe it, other than saying I felt like I was in total control of the car the entire time. Usually I am discouraged from speeding not just by the speed limits, but by the capability of the car. Cars seem to hit a speed where it just feels extremely dangerous and a bit out of control.I was doing 100-110 mph at certain areas with the BMW, and I never felt out of control at all. I felt in total control at 35 or 100 mph.The acceleration was also amazing, for a 215 hp engine. It felt much faster, and the thing that I was taken by was the it gave me the right acceleration at every point. What I mean by this is I've driven cars faster linearlly (a 3.5 Altima for example), but some of those cars just seem like a cannon ball, fast but a bit out of control. The 325i seemed fast in a useful sense, giving me the right acceleration at every point. Also, I was doing this thing where no matter how fast I was going, I could keep myself focused on the edge of the lane divider, and along curves, just hit that lane divider perfectly where I felt like, almost like controlling a video game car or something. It just felt so in control.Now, having said that, here is my question. Is all this I'm describing a BMW thing, or is it more of an ELLPS thing?

"1487","March 2007"," I wouldnt go so far as to say I am frustrated at all. I'm not surprised by the reaction here at all, I'm just surprised that so many have been consumed by the BMW marketing machine. The 3 is a very popular car and those kinds of cars generally do have a strong following. its the same thing with any upbiquitous model like the Accord, Camry, RX, etc. Fans of top sellers often believe that sales are the ultimate proof of a car's excellence when it's convenient. You wont hear any import fans saying the Impala is a great car because it sold nearly 300k units last year, but they will be quick to use sales as a way to prove excellence when talking Camry, Accord or Altima. If we are to go by the ""most sales equals best car"" than the 3 is undoubtedly king. I dont know that I have ""attacked"" the 3 at all, in fact that is kind of funny. The 3 series doesnt have many flaws to talk about but the problem is that it's excellence does not make it's competitors nulll and void. Point is most of the cars being discussed here are excellent and some people seem incapable of accepting that. The 3 may be great but its competition is very good. Some here have contended that not only is the 3 best in class, but its peers are totally unacceptable for the savvy sports sedan shopper. I dont buy that for a second. The people at GM, Audi, Infiniti, Lexus, etc. are not stupid and they know what it takes to make a sporty sedan, even if BMW has been at it longer.

We're talking in a ""performance car"" forum, and the best performing car on the list isn't worth consideration because only badge snobs and poseurs drive them? And you know this because you've looked at people driving BMW's and you can just tell they're not enthusiasts.A number of us here are passionate about performance, and if we didn't need a back seat and trunk on a regular basis, we'd probably be driving a Cayman or Z4 Coupe - I know I would. For many of the people shopping for an ELLPS, they are looking for a car that is the CLOSEST THING to a sports car that has four doors and some luxury thrown in. These are the people that don't want the FWD handling of the TL or the hanging revs/awkward clutch engagement of the G35. I had high hopes when all the buzz first came out about the Lexus IS350. I imagined a sport sedan with the reflexes of a 3-series with the reliability of a Lexus. Well guess what? Lexus pulled the trigger but they missed the bullseye. Same for Infiniti - it's close, but dynamically, it's still a notch below the BMW. If infiniti or Lexus would build a better BMW, I'd buy one.

But I'm a very hard marker and the BMW 335i has several deficiencies I can't overlook: weight, size, interior size, RFTs, mileage, power, transmission, body roll, reliability, cost, resale.The 3 may be great but its competition is very good. Some here have contended that not only is the 3 best in class, but its peers are totally unacceptable for the savvy sports sedan shopper. I'd rank most of them 4s and 5s. I suppose it is blasphemous around here to suggest we are close to parity in this segment but someone had to make the statement. If we want to go back to the status quo BMW praise fest I'll give up and join the chorus.I don't see parity. But then again ask me about 5 restaurants and I can rattle off exactly what I like and don't like at each one. I see clear lines pretty instantly when it comes to critiquing anything involving my money, my stomach or my time. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," If infiniti or Lexus would build a better BMW, I'd buy one. Until then, BMW is still the only game in town for an enthusiast.Amen. I recall being crestfallen when I first read the IS350 would come only with an automatic. Of course, then I drove it, saw Lexus' pricing and their inane ""ordering"" scheme. G35 is still the second best choice but I sure wish Infinit would make it a tougher choice. "
"fedlawman","March 2007"," The internet is starting to buzz about the April issue of Car and Driver Magazine's shootout between the G35 and 328i.According to C&D:""The G35 scores points for comfort, capable moves, and thrust in surplus, but BMW still builds the best tools for driving.""About the G35 - ""...ubiquitious VQ series 3.5-liter V-6...generates stocky midrange torque and, when kept below 4500 rpm keeps the many [Nissan and Infiniti users of the engine] scooting with authority...[but] things go less tickety-boot at high rpms, with vibrations up the shifter and through the floor betraying the rapid percussions of big-bore pistons.""In summary, CD said, the G35 Sport has ""all the ingredients except refinement.""About the 328i - ""BMW&#146;s 3.0-liter silk-weaver...simply can&#146;t be detected through the stick, steering wheel, or pedals...the steering operates with light effort but delivers copious road data...longer drag-strip times [but] who cares when rips to redline are such exquisite pleasure?""Bottom line, said Car and Driver, the 3 Series is ""worth the extra expense over the Infiniti."" "
"nyccarguy","March 2007"," You've definitely got it all wrong when it comes to the 3 series fans (myself included) being blinded by the Ultimate Marketing Machine (BMW). We're very open to new things (with the exception of the CTS, I don't care how good it is GM suckered me into giving me their money once...NEVER AGAIN). We were excited when the new IS350 was on its way with 306 hp and RWD (personally I think the 1st gen IS300 is a better driving car). We all wanted to like the 1st Generation G35 and we wanted to like the 2nd generation G as well. The cars just fall short of some people's high expectations.Many BMW fans and owners have openly criticized the E90 3 series for being overweight, too big, not as driver oriented, and even more disconnected than the previous body style. But we just like to drive home the point that even though it isn't as good as the good old days, we still like it the best in today's ELLPS segment. "
"louiswei","March 2007"," I am sorry...But wanting every other ELLPS, that's including IS350, G35, CTS and TL to be like the 3-series does not qualify as ""open minded"" to me. Me personally I think what makes today's ELLPS market so interesting is because every car has its owner personality instead of being another 3er with a different badge. "
"nyccarguy","March 2007"," That is one way to think of it. But you have got to be kidding yourself if you think that the likes of Lexus, Infiniti, Cadillac, and Audi didn't build their respective cars for the sole purpose of competing (sales and performance) with the 3 series. "
"louiswei","March 2007"," Yes and no. They are trying to compete with the 3-series in the ELLPS market but they are not trying to ""make another 3-series"". I don't know about Infiniti but that's definitely not the case for Acura, Audi, Cadillac and Lexus. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Different companies slice and dice the market a little differently. For example, BMW markets 335i Sport Package to the ELLPS segment with more sporty inclinations, and 328i Premium Package to the ELLPS segment with more luxury inclinations; MB is dividing C into C350 Sport vs. C280 Luxury; Lexus approaches the market with IS and ES (I know what the detractors would say, but with 270+ hp, performance certainly is a design factor even if handling is far from the top priority). We really don't want to bring in too much of their platform mates that are not sedans in here, lest we end up talking about a myriad vehicles with very different characterisitcs. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," It used to be a sport coupe thing (Triumph, 911, Celica/Supra, 240SX/300ZX, Mitsu 3000, Integra, Miata etc.) BMW accomplished a remarkable thing in the 70's and 80's by making a four door sedan to do that, and the market place rewarded it handsomely. Nowadays quite a few competitors are catching on to this; e.g. G35, TL, IS, etc.. The difference between the current G35, TL and IS vs. 3 series in that regard is probably less than the difference between difference between various generations of 3 series. Among BMW's, the biggest jump was made from E30 to E36, when the rear suspension was radically modified to make rear tracking better. Most mfrs in this segment use multi-link rear suspensions nowadays. "
"jmess","March 2007"," The 3 has a big flaw, no limited slip differential. It should be a standard part of the sport package as it is in the G and IS. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Well, the difference in handling among the most sporty models from the different manufacturers are getting smaller nowadays . . . getting to a point where the difference between different manufacturers is smaller than the diffrence between different model variants from the same manufacturer or the difference between different generations of vehicles from the same manufacturer. That makes the real life cost in a rapid replacement fleet schedule all the more relevant. The slightly older cars are becoming really non-competitive; just look at the comment people throw at TL, A4 and CTS nowadays. They are about 3-4 years out of date. "
"brightness04","March 2007","  We've said repeatedly that if ""ultimate performance"" isn't your priority, then the G35 or TL is probably a better choice. Not if cost is a consideration; 3 series is less expensive over 2yrs, 3yrs and 6yrs.Also, if one wants Euro chic bling, 3 series is hard to beat. Although not much of a factor for me nowadays, I'm sure it's high on many 3 series customers' mind. 3 series are very common in congested cities like NYC and Boston . . . not exactly places for passionate sporty driving. Nor is the standard equipment RFT nowadays. Some critics use towing hitch as a litmus test on whether the driver really needs an SUV; IMHO, RFT is a much more valid litmus test on whether the driver really is passionate about sporty driving, as in proof negative. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," hmm, I thought undetectable engine vibration and light steering were faults in sporty cars . . . when someone else (we know who) was doing it. "
"plekto","March 2007"," 1: The CTS is marketed as a 5 series competitor according to Cadillac. So putting it against a 3 is as fair as, say, putting a 3 up aginst an Elise. Afterall, two different companies' entry-level models, right? Roughly the same price, right?(sic for the impared)2:The best sports sedan for the dollar, though, is the RX-8. Luxury it isn't though. But it is without a doubt the most fun you can have for $25K out the door. To get a better ride, you need to spend $35K for a base 3 series. Yes, it has 4 doors - that two open backwards and it is styled to look like a coupe doesn't fool me. I count 4 hinges and 4 door handles. But zero luxury. If they made a luxury version with a supercharger for $35K... Whole other story(300hp, RWD, 3000lbs, loads of luxury.. definite competitor potential).P.S. There is an aftermarket supercharger for it(turbo won't work at all with it due to its design, which isn't liek the older RX-7) that does boost it to 300HP or so. Would be so nice to get it with that from the factory, though. "
"fedlawman","March 2007"," I can see the 3-series being less expensive than a car with lesser resale (or residual factor) like a Hyundai, Audi, or Cadillac. However, the Acura's (TL and TSX) have similar, if not slightly superior resale and resual values.Although not necessarily ""Euro chic,"" the Acura's are likely to be more reliable over the long term too. "
"ggesq","March 2007"," ""The slightly older cars are becoming really non-competitive; just look at the comment people throw at TL, A4 and CTS nowadays.

Wasn't that long ago. BMW recognized the need for more hp and torque and within a year of the intro of the 330i, the 335i comes out. The new G was just introduced a few months ago. Soon, a new CTS, A4 and TL will be out (2008). I would hardly call those cars 3-4 years out of date. "
"habitat1","March 2007"," Where do you get that? The TT is a sub-3000 lbs coupe: Really, what an odd thing for you to say.

And it still weighs 100 lbs more than the Cayman, in spite of having nothing in common with a real sports car. The Cayman only costs $15k more? You could give me a FWD 2.0 TT and I wouldn't pay to insure it. Scroll down on your link - the 3.2 Quatro coupe version weighs in at 3,262 lbs, 400 lbs more than the Cayman, 300 lbs more than the Cayman S. And the convertible weighs in at a mere 500+ lbs more than the Boxster. Didn't mention the convertible as the S2000, TT convertible, Boxster are anything but stunning looking. They're all pretty darn ugly in my opinion. Yeah, that TT Coupe is a real head turner. Did they include the Audi version of the New Beetle's dash mounted vase in the redesign? Or did they just parts share that one directly? (From another post) I'd say you're pretty liberal with the term excellent then.

The TT is still a COW. And, IMO, the A4 will not get any closer to being a serious ELLPS by trimming a couple pounds when it needs to lose several hundred. "
"circlew","March 2007"," So prior to the e92, it was not #1? What was your pecking order before the 335i was introduced? My point was that until now, there were some that perceived the past 3 series were/are underpowered. That HP ""perception"" is now ultimately eliminated from any argument in the E92. *MY* pecking order was the same regardless.I can not comment pre-2006 (E90) since I do not have first hand experience but for me, it was #1 when I made my decision. In other words, 255 HP vs. 280 HP in the G for '06 did not do it for me considering all of the other factors considered.Regards,OW "

I can't comment on performance as I haven't driven one. My ranking of a 335i is based on the all around car. As an overall car in the world it's a 6, borderline 7 (remove the RFTs to get that high). the A4 will not get any closer to being a serious ELLPS by trimming a couple pounds when it needs to lose several hundred. For my money, even an acient A4 is quite a bit beyond cars like the IS350 and CTS. I'd take an A4 frontrak 2.0T for 30k before I'd pick up an IS350 for the same price. Heck, the IS could be cheaper and it still wouldn't register as a choice. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," I agree with you that TL and TSX have similar, if not slightly superior real life resale. However, lease residuals offered by manufacturers are not determined by real life resale but by the manufacturers' eagerness to ush new cars and bend accounting books. Right now, for the month of March 2007, the 24/24 residual on 3 series sedan is 73%, that of the TL is only 68%, and TL Type-S is only 66%. The 5-7% difference there is huge because if you can get the car for 90% MSRP, the 3 series lease would only amortize 17% of MSRP over two years, whereas the TL would be amortizing 22%-24% of MSRP. TL MSRP would have to be 33% lower to make the amortization amount equal; fat chance of that :-) Like I said, the phenomenom of BMWFS giving out free fake money in the form of lease residual, fake but good for car payments on BMW's, is changing the cost equation dramaticly. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," It's a simple statement that people can buy BMW's for all sorts reasons other than being involved in sporty driving. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Okay, you got me there. I meant tot say that they are _only_ 3-4 years out of date. The rationale being that TL is on a 4-yr model cycle, and the new one is coming out next year. By your reckoning, they are only perhaps a couple years being surpassed by new competition. I may even be inclined to agree with you on that. It furthers my argument that this segment is evolving really fast, and the previous generation products from each and everyone of the manufacturers (including BMW) can not hold candle to the latest competition. That's why I suggested that if we want cost to be partof the analysis at all, it has to be based on cost associated with rapid fleet update . . . because after 3-4 (or even 2 years), we are no longer talking about a competitive ELLPS vis. the new competition. "
"hauss","March 2007"," That's fine for discussion of vehicles in general but since this is a sedan discussion the fact that BMW make coupes and convertibles is irrelevant to how their 3 series sedan compares to its competition. So, my argument is not about their product line in general but about their sedan and this forum. "
"fedlawman","March 2007"," Of course, if you want to have a new car every 2 or 3 years, and don't mind always having a car payment, then BMW does make the money cheap.But that's the only scenario where it pays off. Paying $10,000 every 2 years for the benefit of having a brand new car every 2 years isn't cheap. At the end of 6 years, you've paid out $30,000 and own nothing.I know it's apples and oranges (leasing is a great solution for many people - business owners especially), but personally, I'd rather pay cash and own the car outright. I'll keep the car as long as I want, and then pass it on to my kids if it's a good one (like my V70). "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," hat's why I suggested that if we want cost to be partof the analysis at all, it has to be based on cost associated with rapid fleet update . . . because after 3-4 (or even 2 years), we are no longer talking about a competitive ELLPS vis. the new competition.I wouldn't agree with that at all. The ELLPS is bloating and numbing at an alarming pace. Evolution usually implies improvement in the function of a species. ELLPS today v. an e46 (1998 chassis) - no contest, the e46. The only things my e46 ZHP sedan really lacked were power, weight reduction and an LSD - the M3's engine and LSD would have solved two of those. To each his own. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Well, E36 fans said the same thing about E46, and in turn were ridiculed by E30 fans who liked the jumpy rear end. Actually, E46 started the trend of bloat, by borrowing suspension geometry from E40 5 series, in order to get a smooth ride than smothers out pot holes.When Lexus tried to listen to the ""real enthusiasts"" and put forth the IS300, which was more in common to E30 than E46 was in terms of driving dynamics and riding quality, the market place gave it a big thumb-down. That pretty much proved that not only people don't always buy BMW's for performance; the ""real enthusiasts"" are not even in the driver's seat in terms of new car sales. "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," Fed, pay out 30k over 6 years on any of the ELLPS cars and you still don't own anything. It'll take another 10-15k to pay off one of those. So after 40k and 8 years you might own an ELLPS and it'll be worth about 6-7k. Just keeping 40k in the bank would work out better (about 59k).  "
"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," I'd say the original IS failed more on the poor power, origins, bad gas mileage, boy racer exterior/interior. It was hard to get past the boy-racer feel of the car and the fact Lexus wanted 30k+ for a rebadged Toyota with little power and 18 mpg.  "
"hauss","March 2007"," Hey, to each their own, right? I'm 6' 1"" and also have long legs for my height. I weigh less than you at 200 lbs but mostly found myself struggling for shoulder and arm room. I just felt crowded as I do in a lot of compact size cars in this group. We all have our own requirements. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Exactly! You took the words right out of my mouth. When a lease deal is amortizing only 17% of MSRP over 24 months, it means the buyer would have to keep the car some 11 years to make depreciation outlay comparable. That's not even counting any repair and maintenance cost (which are none for the first 24mo, but sizable if not huge for BMW's over 5 years old). Then there's the subsidized lease money factor that is lower than interest that one can collect at a bank. "
"brightness04","March 2007"," Well, E30 would very much be a boyracer compared to E46 and E90. 200hp was about what most E36 and E46 had (some as low as 168hp), much more than what typical E30 had. Pedigree, well, that's for pets :-) "
"brightness04","March 2007"," I have shared that conventional wisdom with you for much of my driving life. All my cars, excepting one, were paid with cash. That view is being severely challenged in recent years in the face of vendor financing. Blueguy has it well covered from the financial perspective. I just want to point out also that, after a model cycle (or even less), whatever we buy today would be either a boyracer or a family car by the standards of that time, not really ELLPS so even if had cost less it would be an apples-to-oranges comparison. Thankfully, we don't even have to choose between money and being to date nowadays; a bit odd, yes. "
"kdshapiro","March 2007"," I agree. See a lot of Porsches, Ferraris, Maserati in Manhattan also. Lot of poseurs out there driving very expensive and sport cars in 5 mph traffic. Shame on those poseurs, giving these high-brow brands a bad name. "

That's one main reason why Ferrari is in Formula 1, to sell sex appeal.If every Ferrari driver has to pass a Michael Schumacher test, Ferrari would be a fraction of its current size. BMW knows most M5 drivers can't be trusted to use even half its full power, and yet every new M5 has even more power! "

"circlew","March 2007"," Interesting Edmunds track test indicates the bar has been raised as expected. The limp-home thing was also a good sign that the Germans have more work to do on the turbo performance/reliability.We will see coming feedback on this comparo but I personally expected improvements in the G and the weight factor still hinders performance as some of the more intuitive posters here have noted. The '08 coupe weighs in at 3,571# vs. 3,682# 335 coupe and the 9/10 test shows G on top for the out of the corner acceleration/control for this test. 0-60 was not compared here.It looks like Infinity has done a commendable job keeping their offering razor close to expected competition at the top of the sister to this category with their coupe.Regards,OW "
"victord1","March 2007"," It looks like Infinity has done a commendable job keeping their offering razor close to expected competition at the top of the sister to this category with their coupe.Yeah, I certainly hope so. And they definitely have to polish out the rough edges. In the April C&D comparo the G35 lost to the 328i due to the lack of ""refinement"". IMO, that's quite pathetic, considering C&D favored the G35 over the 325i a few years ago. I also read Edmunds preview of the G37 coupe. I thought the 335i ""limp mode"" part was funny.

While good handling is a geneal goal shared by these vehicles, I wouldnt say they are all designed to be clones of the 3 series.

"brightness04","March 2007"," Thank you, Pat for moving some of the BMW-specific details. This is a response to a question regarding other ELLPS that habitat had (and the answer wouldn't quite fit in the new forum):I'm not familiar with S2000, but the TL has fluid-fill engine mounts controlled by piezo electric driver that are fed data by engine piston position sensors. That's why TL achieved nearly complete engine-vibration free cabin and steering long before BMW 3 series did, regardless the intrisic virtues of I6 vs. V6. Nowadays, just about any engine geometric configuration can be made smooth enough to let the electronicly controlled fluid-filled engine mounts to take over and smother out the last bit of vibration. For 6 and more cylinders, intrinsic smoothness due to inter-piston layout geometry is about as relevent to today's cars as who made the best carberretor; i.e. not a heck lot. Some manufactuers are going so far as to make modular V6's that are 90 degrees and narrow-angle V6's that have angles much less than the cannonic 60 degree V6's, all counting on engine mounts to reduce vibration for them. It's a great idea that Pat moved much of the arcana BMW engine discussion to a different forum, because much of the supposed historical superiority really have little to do with today's ELLPS that have much more advanced technology to make some of the old characteristics quite irrelevent.ps. Thanks, Pat, for suggesting the change to post title. Done. "
"louiswei","March 2007"," Let's leave the Bimmer alone for a minute shall we... :P When I was ""taking care of business"" yesterday at the house I saw the February issue of the R&T laying around so I picked it up and start reading the Japanese ""sporty sedans"" comparison for the second time. Although I generally agree with the verdict but would like to share my point of view since I did test drive both the G35S, TL-S before and currently own an IS350.My ranking:3. TL-SPros:- Good Value. Although the sticker is at $38K, one can easily get one for around $35K which is a lot of car (and gadget) for that price.- Confident handling for a FWD.- Best interior in terms of design in this segment.- Optional manual transmissionCons:- Nose heavy feeling. This is obvious since it's a FWD and probably wouldn't bother too many people whom moved up from their current mid-sizer.- Lack of power in terms of competition. 280HP and some change is definitely not weak but since its major competitors are all in the 300 range, it could certainly use some boost in this department.- Interior cost cutting. fake CF, fake wood, low quality material for door panel handles. Nothing major but worth mentioning IMO.Bottom Line: Excellent car as a mid-sizer step up and good ELLPS but don't pay MSRP for it.2. G35SPros:- Improved interior over the previous model. The new interior looks elegant, especially the washi aluminum trim.- Best handling in all Japanese ELLPS.- Good value. Similar equipped, it is considerably cheaper than competitors, Japanese or not.- Optional manual transmission.Cons:- Interior cost cutting. Hard plastic being used for lower part of the door panel. This issue is not major but shouldn't happen for a car that's in the $30K-40K range.- Strange position for control buttons. Infiniti decided they are better off facing upward instead forward (or to the drive). Why? I don't know.- The new VQ. Although rated at 306HP, it is slower than Toyota's 2GR-FSE and BMW's twin-turbo 6 in terms of both driving feel and statistic. Lack the low RPM boost. Bottom Line: Excellent performance sedan for the price and if you are a so-called ""enthusiast"" with a preference of Japanese make this is the one to get.1. IS350Pros:- One of the best interiors in this segment. Material used is top-notch, excellent fit-and-finish- Smooth and powerful V6. The 306HP 2GR-FSE is capable to push the car from 0-60 in less than 5 seconds according to R&T and that's faster than an Audi S4. This car is wicket fast in ECT sports mode.- Lots of standard gadgets.- Good balance between sporty and luxury.- Smooth 6-speed auto trannyCons:- No manual tranny available.- Tight interior space.- Cheap (although not cheap looking) metallic trim instead of real aluminum.- Handling not as crisp as the competition, has more isolated steering feel.- Intrusive VDIM system. It's good that on the 2007 model Lexus decided to put a VDIM-off switch. Too bad that us 06' owners still have to resort to the ""tap dancing"" method.Bottom Line: Offers excellent balance between performance and luxury, argubly one of the best ""all-around"" entry-level luxury performance sedan on the market. As long as one doesn't race it on the track. "
"1487","March 2007"," I agree about the G35 interior, the press have given it a free ride on this but its hardly class leading. I found all sorts of hard plastic and slightly cheap touches inside. The LOOK is fine, but the details are not up to Lexus or BMW standards. Same applies to the TL although to a lesser extent. I was also surprised the G has fixed rear headrests which isnt something you commonly find in Japanese sedans. "
"hauss","March 2007"," Overall a nice review. Here are other comments from my vantage point:TL-S: Best interior ergonomics among the three. Most spacious of the 3. Worst looking wheels among the three. Also, it's a shame they don't offer 18"" factory wheel option (you can get them dealer installed). Best stereo among the three. Auto tranny should be 6 speed. G35: Interior ergonomics have improved but are still poor for a car in this segment. Interior design is choppy compared to TL and IS350 but is much improved over last generation. For a car of it's size (exterior) the interior is a bit cramped.IS350: Most expensive of the 3. Aside from hard plastic on grip side door panel handles are same material as TL-S (rubber). "
"louiswei","March 2007"," Best stereo among the three.Have you compare TL's stereo to IS's Mark Levison? I have to admit that I am not big into stereo systems but it'll be nice to find out why one is better than the others. "
"hauss","March 2007"," I was going by the general standard stereos with my comment but to your point the premium Mark Levinson systems Lexus uses are stellar and just as good as Acura's ELS surround sound system. Lexus lists it as a stand alone option but that's really only if you're willing to special order the vehicle that way. I think the option packages it comes with is about $3800. Plus, you'll likely have a hard time finding one with just that option package - there will be other options included. That drives up the price. In my experience the only IS350s I've seen with the Mark Levinson stereo are well into the $40k's. So, that's why I'd say the TL stereo is better based on the cost factor and that it's in every vehicle. "
"andres3","March 2007"," In 2004 when they first came out, that was reason enough and alone to buy a TL! Do they still play DVD-A? "

"andres3","March 2007"," haha, well, I was half heartedly joking there about buying the TL soley for the sound system and DVD Audio playing capabilities.Although, car manufacturers do have a tendency to take eons to evolve and progress regarding technology. They were using tape/radios commonly in the mid 90's for goodness sakes!!! Wasn't the CD around 15 years old by that time?But, the TL was fantastic for many other reasons too. "
"habitat1","March 2007"," The stereos, nav systems, power butt massagers, etc. available in many ELLPS are certainly nice features......but it seems, much like the computer on your desk (or rather, lap) they are evolving to the point where a 2-3 year old ELLPS is out of date and if you own a 4-5 year old ELLPS, it's a sign your career may have stalled.As I've stated numerous times before, keeping my 1995 Nissan Maxima SE, with next to no options (only ABS) for 10+ years and 155k miles was a factor in my being comfortable splurging on a 911. When I hear of others getting a new $40k+ ELLPS every 3 years to keep up with the latest and greatest, I can only respond that ""it's your money"". Dropped off my 911 for a malfunctioning passenger power seat yesterday and a 60-ish gentleman in a 1995 993 model 911 was picking up his car after an oil change. Looked like it had just come off the showroom floor, in spite of 90,000 miles. He looked at my car, with the power this and that, nav system, etc. and just laughed, with a comment that ""thank god my car doesn't have all that stuff to break"".  "
"louiswei","March 2007"," ""thank god my car doesn't have all that stuff to break"". Yeah, but the thing is...Those things are getting pretty reliable now-a-day which they don't break as much often. Well, at least on the non-European imports that is...However, I am still on the fence about the navi. I hate to not be able to listen to my favorite music if the nav system decided not to corporate one day. Portable GPS is still the way to IMO (at least for right now). "
"kdshapiro","March 2007"," VZ Nav all the way. "
"hauss","March 2007"," That 60-ish guy you talked about sounds like my 74 year old father. He thinks electronic components on anything are susceptible to high rates of failure. It doesn't matter if we're talking about the controls on a washer/dryer, a tv, or a car. It's funny how people remember things one way sometimes and can never change their viewpoint. "
"habitat1","March 2007"," Those things are getting pretty reliable now-a-day which they don't break as much often.Maybe you are right, but my experience isn't great - our 2005 MDX had to have the Navigation control unit (DVD reader under the passenger seat) replaced twice, first when it placed us in the Atlantic Ocean on the way home from Boston and then when it just froze up. And, as I said, my 911 is in the shop because the power passenger seat stopped working in an unusable far forward position. No manual override to push it back. I've also heard of some malfunctioning bluetooth / voice activated electronics in both Lexus and Acura. Royal pain in the butt for a ""mechanic"" to try to figure out what the problem is. And complete replacement of these systems is not cheap when it's out of warranty. A complete nav system replacement (including screen) would probably approach the grand total of all maintence and repairs on my Maxima in 155k miles (under $3,500, including 38 oil changes).I admit that the gadget craze is here to stay with respect to ELLPS. Especially since there seem to be a lot more folks concerned about ""L"" than ""P"". I recall someone in this forum even claiming not offering ventilated seats as ""unacceptable"" in this segment. But along with this gadgetry comes a lot of premature obsolescence given how long the actual car could last. That 12 year old 993 model 911 sure looked great to me, in spite of none of the accutriments that are required in sub-ELLPS today. And it could still kick the butt of almost any pure ""P"" car in any segment. "

I believe it had around 72 horsepower, but I may be exaggerating. After 40k miles, I did ""upgrade"" the OEM steel wheels, hubcaps and whitewall tires to aluminum alloys with 165/70 13"" Michelins. And early on, I outfitted it with a removable Nakamichi AC/DC cassestte deck, Fosgate Power amp/pre-amp, and Rogers studio speakers for the hatch. My car was the hit of every softball game and beach party for 3-4 summers before I got a real job. Tiny by today's standards, yet, in the spring of 1979, that car managed to make it from Pittsburgh to Baltimore and back, loaded with me (5'7"", 145) and three fraternity brothers (5'10""/165, 6'/175, 6'2""/200) as well as 4 duffle bags in the hatch for a long weekend trip.

I paid $4,300 for it, brand new, including taxes. About $800 less than I paid in taxes alone for my 911S. And, not to get nostalgic, I had a heck of a lot of fun with that Datsun.

"wale_bate1","April 2007"," Yeah, so what?I'm not being snotty about it. No, really. Your '06 would be slightly larger overall than my '03 IS wagon, and have a touch more rear seat, I think. My wife and two kids (girl 13, who already takes after my height of the family and boy 11 who will when he hits 15) fit in there just fine for around town, and we are fully comfortable for trips up to two hours or so one-way (that's with overnight/weekend luggage). No problem whatsoever.Now, it's not our principal family hauler. That duty, plus the long hauls, falls to the Town & Country, and it performs admirably in such capacity.I'll speculate that these sedans are not the principal family vehicle for most posters, but rather their car, and get used fairly infrequently to schlep four full-sized adults (let alone wife and kids) any further than lunch from the office or home from the links, something even my little IS will do with relative ease.Makes more sense to me to buy a midsize than decry the lack of space in a compact, which is what the EL, whether L, P or both, has customarily been.Another reality, to me, is that the EL only makes sense if you're dicussing the OPP vehicle from a ""lux-sport"" mfr in the first place. For Caddy, big and bulky CTS is their OPP, and for now same applies to BMW here, until the 1/2 hits. Not so Audi, nor Acura. It would not surprise me in the least to hear Nissan announce a new slot for Infiniti at next year's shows, and there has been word previously that a slightly smaller 250-based 5-door is on the boards at Toyota for Lexus.Interesting about the GS, but predictable I guess, as it now shares platform and parts with the now oversized (IMO) IS.

At the Atlanta Auto Show a few weeks ago I was unable to do the same thing in a BMW 328i - I couldn't even get in the back seat without sitting sideways. Now, my TL is roomier. I can actually sit in the back behind the driver's seat set to my postion fairly comfortably. I could probably ride that way for a few hours. "

Two things in particular caught my eye the SCCA Speed World Challenge series and the Grand Am series. Apparently Acura's TSX has been a pretty successful platform there and it competes against the BMW 3, Audi A4, etc. From what I read it seems modifications are minimal in both classes and it's mostly likely those TSXs are FWD. Bimmer fans how can it be that your beloved 3 series is getting beat on a track by a FWD platform? On a different note I've put up some postings in a few places here on Carspace looking for help with repairing a paint chip and haven't had any luck getting a response. I know this forum isn't for that but if anyone on here has any advice for me I'd love to hear it. Thanks. "

Sure cars are heavier now, they have more safety features, more sound deadening, more electronics, larger brakes, larger engines, etc. The days of 3000lb family cars are long gone but that doesnt mean cars like the 3 series or A4 are ""huge"" all of a sudden. The A4 is pretty heavy due to AWD but its still small. The 3 series is small and relatively light. I do not see any need to buy a Mini or Scion just because sport sedans weigh 3400lbs.

"bruceomega","April 2007"," wale_bate1,I think you answered the so what. It all depends on what your requirements and priorities are.In my own case, if the car is primarily for 1 or 2 people, and only an occasional back seat rider or 2, then the 3 series is more than adequate for me.But if I want to carry 1 or 2 passengers in the back seat on a regular basis, or for long distances, then the 3 series is not a good choice, for me.We have another car that fits passengers in the back seat more comfortably than the 3 series sedan, an X3. I find it quite roomy, especially considering its only 1.6 inches longer. But that doesn't rule out my interest in one day having a sedan with more back seat room so we don't always have to take the X3 when we have 3 or 4 in the car.I'm surprised you consider the IS oversized.ThanksBruce "

In the GS-350, I could get into the back seat, but it took a lot of work and I felt really snug once there. The biggest problem for me was trying to get back out - that took a lot of work. This was in contrast to the roomier back seats for other cars in that category, such as the M35/M45.ThanksBruce "

My feeling is that if it has a back seat it's good for any normal adult for 30-45 minutes. They may not like it but suck it up.The 335i weighs 3600 lbs. For comparison an e46 330i was less than 3300 lbs. That's a big, big jump and no amount of HP will offset the physical bulk now added to the vehicle. They didn't add 300+ lbs of safety to the new 3 series. They simply fattened the calf with an assortment of worthless add-ons (sound deadening being one of them). "

"fedlawman","April 2007"," Hauss, the TSX is a great car, but you cannot use racing as a benchmark. I was a TSX owner when the TSX hit the Speed World Challenge, and I really enjoyed watching the Acura mix it up with the BMW 3-series.During the TSX's first year, it gave the BMW a very good run for the money, but Bill Auberlein and the E46 325i dominated the series. In an effort to even the field, the following year SCCA handicapped the 3-series with more ballast and throttle body restrictor plates - it worked. The BMW dropped down to a mid-field runner and Auberlein et al left the series, only competing in a handful of races (which they still managed to finish on the podium).The TSX is a terrific sedan with great potential for performance (and lots of aftermarket speed parts available). On the street, it's a worthy competitor to the E46 325i (and a luxury/performance bargain). On the track, it's FWD layout and forward biased weight distribution puts a damper on the fun.I started doing HPDE's back in 2003 and to my mind, rather than tweak the TSX and try to turn it into a more balanced sport sedan with better tires, thicker rear sway bar, more HP, etc, I decided I'd much rather start from scratch and get a proper RWD sport sedan - which is why I sold my TSX and bought a BMW 2 years ago.On paint chips - try this kit. http://www.touchup123.com/default.aspx? I bought the basic kit for my M3 a few months ago, and with great care and patience, I repaired numerous chips to the point that I won't get the car re-sprayed like I originally planned. Here's a before and after shot of my front bumper (the white chips in the after photo are new chips I've acquired since doing the repair (the Pacific NW is very hard on car finishes!).You can still see the repairs if you get in close and look, but they don't jump out and grab you like they used too.

"circlew","April 2007"," Plenty of people buy cars and don't list safety as top priority.

If you do not plan safety before hand with those, kiss yourself good-bye sooner or later.Sport is not compromised by weight if sport is only one factor in your preferences rather than weighted predominatly as the goal. When one is at that higher level of sporting desire, to me, you are out of this category of vehicle. You might track the car, but there are many other choices that can excite at a much higher level. When I buy a vehicle for the road, safety is a high priority. Better brakes, handling, ridgitity and improved systems such as airbags are a priority DESPITE extra girth.

This is the basis for complaint about weight gains over the years. Even the pure sports cars have gotten heavier, ponderous. BTW, regardless of what safety measures one takes in any sport or endeavor, said endeavor comes with inherent risks and some are much greater than others. For instance, flying small aircraft is said to have the highest risk out of all manner of transportation.

"plekto","April 2007"," The problem isn't safety equipment. The car(BMW 3 series) really isn't any safer now than it was a few years ago.

Long gone are the days when the 3 series was a pure sports sedan. Now, it's a yuppie luxury car.Now, some cars can do it right. The Altima, which isn't a small car, mind you, is 3000lbs. And a lot of people are impressed with it, mainly because it's 500-600lbs lighter than most of the competition. It needs less power, smaller brakes, and can get by without 17 inch rims.Or take a RX-8. 3000lbs, fully loaded. It handles almost as well as a 3 series because it weighs 20% less. With mods, I've seen people drop another 200lbs off of it for racing without hardly changing a thing in its daily functioning(mostly aluminum parts, carbon fiber hood, etc). 2800lbs and 240+ HP is a rocket in the twisties compared to the new cars. 3/4 the weight will do that for you.

The car's muted and lacks any verve.

BMW needs that 1 series fast or they're going to lose their entire performance market in a decade.Oh - the M model of the 1 series(not to be confused with the M1) is an absolute winner.

"brightness04","April 2007"," The Vette ride quality improved dramaticly too in those 20 years. The new Vette is actually quite a smooth ride on highways. IMHO, the difference Tex mentioned in vette vs. 3 series is that:1. Just like Mariner mentioned, Vette hasn't changed much in vehicle size whereas the 3 series today is bigger than 5 series of 20 years ago. In fact, the wheelbase of today's 3 series is nearly half a foot longer than the wheelbase of 5 series of 20 years ago. The Europeans are finally making American sized cars because they are no longer facing material shortage (relative to labor) like they did decades ago. The European/British sportscar tradition was literally born of a necessity after WWII when they had little natural resources but a lot of mouths to feed; they had to make something to trade for food import, turning import steel to cars was one of the solutions. That's why the value to weight ratio of those cars had to be high (becaue much of the raw material for buildings cars had to be imported too); hence very small cars at relatively high price, and ""sportiness"" was sold those cars.2. Vette is a technological and engineering tour-de-force. Everything is tried to save an ounce here and an ounce there. I'm not even sure if GM makes any money on making Vette; it's the halo car for the company. On the other hand, 3 series is the main source of income for BMW. Bean-counting decisions have to be made for such a bread-and-butter car (for BMW).

However, by the time Volvo has done building ELLS on the same platform to produce S40/V50, the car weighs 3200-3300lbs, and has squeezed out much of the sportiness. It may have something to do with what consumers demand in entry level luxury cars. Personally, I would not buy any car weighing less than 3300lbs, preferrably 3600+lbs, simply because that's the weight of an average decade-old Jeep Cherokee that a lot of high school kids learning to drive are driving. I wouldn't want to place my family in anything weighing much less than what the most accident-prone population is driving. "
"circlew","April 2007"," KD, agreed. The Altima is out if you want real safety and real performance. It really depends on the level that you expect and the balance delivered. The weight issue can be debated up and down the food chain regarding vehicle hierarchy. Sports cars are sports cars and ELLPS are what they are as well. If there are 4 people in say an RX-8, you can not drive at 10/10ths, agreed? If one wants true performance in this segment at this point, the 3'er looks to me as where it's at! (IMHO) Hefty? Perhaps. Alternative? Debatable.Regards,OW "
"circlew","April 2007"," I agree with your assessment regarding the minimum weight desired and defensive safety for the family. I believe this is why even today the 3'er is a notch ahead of the pack here. You get a higher level of performance with good safety at the expense of about 6 months of Big Macs under the belt!Put another way, sub 3K lbs. (1,360 Kg.) in Europe was OK when most cars were predominantly under that anyway. Even there the cars are plumping up so pure sports setups are more custom than what you can get stock as was more prevalent in the past.I say we draft a law that allows teenyboppers to only drive Smart Cars until they hit, say, 30!! You can't hurt a squirrel with one of those!Regards,OW "

I checked the others and they were all 4 - 5 Star rating except the G35 and IS250/350 which were not rated for 2006 or 2007.The 2007 Altima, by the way, rated one of the highest ratings against these cars in all the rated categories. The 3.5 SE sedan weighs in @ 3,294 lbs. vs. 3,340 lbs. for the 328 sedan, both manual.So, both of these 2 cars are safe but are a little hefty if you want maximum sporting. The trick will be to reduce 300 lbs off the weight and maintain the excellent crash data.BGDC, perhaps I spoke to soon.

If it skims on creature comforts, it'll lose sales to MB or any number of makes. Most Bimmers are everyday car, their owners expect all the things that go with that.Vette is an icon, sort of w/o natural rivals. I guess the car closest in iconic status is 911. GM has a lot more leeway in designing Vette, because of lack of natural rivals. Plus Vette is a toy, not everyday car, to many of its owners, so they don't mind if it lacks many creature comforts, or if the suspension is real uncomfy!Now that new M3 has a V8, I wouldn't bet on the Vette when the 2 meet on a race course.

"ivan_99","April 2007"," Weight.As I start my diet I have a perspective on this...Lighter weight is better; for performance, handling, mileage etc. If luxury buyers prefer the long floaty feel of a heavy vehicle you can engineer that in a light vehicle...but really why would you want to.Also, almost as important as light weight is weight distribution. 30/70 (or 70/30) on a 2800 lbs car is not my idea of a good time. I recall driving the prev gen A6 in FWD and AWD; the AWD handled better even thought it was heavier.Stacking extra thick glass and huge expansive sunroofs also decrease the &#147;fun factor&#148;, even if the automobile is sub 3000 lbs.Since the rx-8 was already mentioned here I think that is a good example of a vehicle properly balanced with relatively low weight (for the times) centered in the vehicle and being low to the ground; Cayman also comes to mind.This of course is all relative because even though I desire the light/low/balanced vehicle the Lotus has never been a desire of mine.

"scottmsimpson","April 2007"," Thanks for the inputs. Let me define my requirements a bit more. We were planning to keep the CL for 2-3 years, then let our kids use it. At that point, I could justify a two seater, like a Cayman. Well, that plan was shot when I crashed the CL, resulting in total loss, due to airbags going off. So, need to buy a new car in the next 2-3 weeks.I do want a ""nice"" car, as I do take monthly 100 mile trips to Madison and Chicago. We will keep this car for several years. On top of the normal features, The things on the CL and our Villager I particularly like are Homelink and Auto Climate control, and one feature I think every car should have, but only our Villager has, is auto on/off headlamps. Not DRL's, which I do not like, but entire lighting system turns on when it's dark. I also don't like doors that automatically lock.The smaller cars suggested are not on my radar; too small, too 'cheap' for our needs. I don't think one can get Homelink and auto climate on Mazda 3's, Eclipses, etc. I'm not so keen on VW's, spotty reliability record of late. The TSX has every lux feature we would need. Only negative is less power compared with the turbos and V6's in others. I think one could deal on a MS 6 and Legacy to get one under $30K. IS250 is definetly way over $30, closer to $35. I can afford that, but can't justify spending that much on a daily driver.I'd look at A4's and 328's for that dollar amount, but they would probably be strippers. As suggested, the TSX and Accord are near end of life cycle, so may deal better. As soon as this April blizzard passes, I'll get to driving these vehicles. "

"plekto","April 2007"," I have the perfect solution.Since a Cayman(which I adore, btw) is a chunk of money, you want to save every penny that you can until then. You are the perfect poster-child for a three year lease.(with one exception - see below)A 2007 Cadillac CTS can be had for $299 a month.The BMW 328i is ~$399 a month, give or take.(yes both deals are insanely low - someone's losing money somewhere)You can also get an Audi A4 for $299 a month - or at least that's what the local dealer has on the car window. There are some insane lease deals out there on cars right now.(let alone things like $189 a month on an Accord/WV/etc - all about the same)Go cheap, save your pennies. Then get the Cayman. *The exception is to buy a Mini. It suffers about $1000 a year in depreciation, due to silly pent-up demand and cult-like status. The new one fits 2 kids in the rear well enough(even two car seats!) Of course, buy a base model with little on it to maximize your return/minimize accessory value loss) "
"blueguydotcom","April 2007"," Most of those lease deals require money down to pay down the cap cost. Every $1000 drops the payment by about $15-17.Also most require an acquisiton cost (usually over $495) and a return fee ($250 and up). All the fees add up. Leases can be a good deal but they can also devour you slowly if you're not careful. Most people leasing never bother to learn the lease money factors/residuals or how all of that plays into the lease rate. I know far too many people who lease by asking for ""the deal."" Break down the numbers on the advertised deal and it's better to just find out the MF and the negotiate your sale price as you would with any car purchase. Even then, it may not be a very good deal. If he has frequent flyer miles, then european delivery on a stripped 328i is about the best deal you can get (you aren't paying for 13-14% of the depreciation) for a lease. Add in the BMWCCA rebate and it gets a tad sweeter. Then again, a 328i via ED purchased = tremendous savings too. Essentially you dodge 50% of the first year of depreciation. "

"brightness04","April 2007"," I totally agree with you on the general sentiment. Lately, however, something very weird is going on. It's as if some of the luxury brands are caught up in some kind of discount selling frenzy. CTS can indeed be had for $299 with no money down (big surprise to me too), and 328i local lease (no ED) is being advertized for $129/mo with $5500 down (which works out to be $360-370/mo or so with no money down). It's getting to the point where ED may not be worth the time unless one is picking up a loaded 335i or higher. For example, one of my local dealers is http://www.herbchambers.com where they are showing both deals mentioned above.It's getting a little out of hand. Perhaps the luxury brands expanded their capacity so much in the past few boom years that they are now having to sell at marginal cost (i.e. at a price point that does not help defraying R&D cost) just to keep the factories going. That's typical of industries that are heavy on capital investment and low on marginal cost; the classic example being the airlines . . . every producer/supplier can lose a boat load of money very quickly in a price war in an industry like that.

I find it frustrating that so many on this forum either slavishly cite HP or similarly cite 0-60 as the only arbiter of performance. Cars with good 0-60 performance generally shoot out of the blocks and may or may not have good mid range power/torque. As opposed to soccer moms in SUVs and minivans, I don't have any need for jetting off the line in suburbia (why do they do that anyway?). Where I want power is: a) passing at 50 mph on the way up Highway 50 in the Sierra Nevada, b) out of a country road curve at 35 mph, or c) merging on to a freeway. In SoCal, where you often have to accelerate from 40 to 75 quickly to safely merge on a freeway, 0-60 is meaningless. So unless a poster is referring to his hobby of going out to the local race track to do time trials, I wish the HP and 0-60 stats would be shelved. "
"blueguydotcom","April 2007"," On the same side, I despise the tests that do 30-50 or 50-70 top gear acceleration. I buy manuals. I would never conceive of attempting to accelerate in top gear and wouldn't even be in top gear going under 65 mph. "
"circlew","April 2007"," You will never shelve the 0-60 times. This is the main metric for acceleration. You have a great point in that you want to compare mid-accelaration times, such as, 10-30, 20-40 or 30-60.They are all a guide so that if you wan to pass a soccer-person minivan to get to an off/on-ramp, you know you can or you know you can't.Regards,OW "

"plekto","April 2007"," If you look at how they tend to do the tests, it's not realistic at all in most cases. Why? Because manually shifting the automatic gearbox or revving it and dropping the clutch in *third gear* aren't typical driving patterns.More useful are the slalom and passing tests, because some cars are slugs due to having a torque converter locked.(and again, manually down-shifting isn't kosher unless the car has a manu-matic.)About magazines, while I generally loathe Consumer Reports, their track test-data is very close to real-life since they don't play tricks to squeeze out a few tenths of a second.P.S. Horsepower ratings are nearly meaningless unless we can also see it throughout the gears. "

"cdnpinhead","April 2007"," "". . . overall handling balance is surprisingly neutral with understeer noticable only through tight corners . . .""Well, in the interest of inclusiveness (it's now required), your quote prompted me to research the TL. For those who care (2?) and those who haven't heard yet, my requirements for a next car are: 1) manual transmission, 2) RWD, 3) excellent handling (usually comes with the RWD), 4) space to store my bicycle inside the vehicle, 5) something resembling luxury, 6) decent fuel mileage & 7) stone solid reliability/longevity.Your quote was interesting, since I've learned that getting all of this is impossible; however, there may be other options for achieving good handling. I've become willing to (possibly) throw RWD under the bus, which has allowed the A3 & A4 back into the mix. Getting an Acura that handles half-way decently (I drove my daughter's Prelude a week or so ago -- solid) sounded like a third FWD possibility.So, I went to (where else) Edmunds & learned that the TL/S isn't even listed (or if it is, I'm too stupid to find it). From there I went to the Acura site & learned that I had to pay for navigation that I don't want (have my own portable) & that fold-down rear seats aren't available. I think they called it a pass-through. My bike's front fork most assuredly won't ""pass through.""However, in the spirit of Mark (a 27-Audi driving person who actually considered an Infiniti) & Shipo (who taught me that driving a BMW didn't necessarily make me a status-seeking poseur), I went well away from my comfort zone and learned. . .that I shouldn't have bothered.Sounds like the TL/S is a viable option for those who want a loaded vehicle with a manual transmission & limited hauling capacity.Sadly, I'm not in the cohort.Continuing the hunt. "
"habitat1","April 2007"," ""Please see any auto magazine for splits every 10 mph on the way up to 120. You can easily calculate the 50-70 times by simple subtraction.""That ""simple"" subtraction will not produce anything close to the 50-70 times that are separately run, usually by keeping the car in top gear (or at least the same gear) in a manual transmission car. For example, I have the Motor Trend road test of a 911S and it shows 0-50 in 3.2 and 0-70 in 5.6, which would ""subtract"" to a 50-70 in 2.4 seconds. They don't show a separate 50-70 time, but the ones I have seen are at least double that figure. MT also doesn't show their shift points, but I'm guessing that they are hitting 50 in 2nd gear and 70 in 3rd, shifting somewhere in the 60 mph range. If the actual 50-70 test was done in 6th, 5th or even 4th, you'd get much slower times than 2.4 seconds. If I were cruising along at 50 mph, I'd probably be in 4th or 5th rather than 6th, but I sure as heck wouldn't be cruising in 2nd at 6,000 rpm. Bottom line is that everyone should do their own test drives. On the same note, although I own a 2004 TL 6-speed and it was rated as fast or faster than some of the top performing RWD ELLPS at the time, it takes a hell of a lot more practice to launch a FWD vehicle to a 6 second 0-60 sprint than, say, a RWD 330i. The FWD wheel hop, tire spinning and torque steer make achieving those times in a TL on city streets a white knuckle experience compared to a relative walk in the park for a 3 series. And that's something I learned from my own extensive test drives, not reading MT or Road and Track. I bought the TL not to drag race at stoplights, but beacause of its well balanced set of attributes. "

"pv2","April 2007"," Good points; nobody is holding 2nd at 60 just cruising along, so those figures wouldn't be totally accurate. I was trying to contrast the 50-70 times that are done by holding top gear, which is also unrealistic if you're in a passing situation. In a manual you would clearly downshift one or two gears, so I think that doing the subtraction would give you a more realistic approximation of what you would experience if you downshifted in a manual or let the automatic do it for you. Having an auto equipped 2007 TL-S, I can say that the throttle is quite sensitive; if I press down a little I get no downshift; something more I get 4th and more than halfway down I get 3rd. It didn't take me long to figure out what the tranny would do. I sometimes use the manu-matic function and find that it shifts just a bit faster, probably due to software mods, but if I'm on the highway and need to pass, it's a bit easier and faster to just hit the gas pedal and let the tranny do the work.I do agree that everyone should do their own testing, but it would require an associate with a stopwatch to get any precision beyond ""seat of the pants"". I also agree that any manual FWD car, including the TL would require some practice to get really good 0-60 times. The auto version would be a few ticks slower, but since it's equipped with traction control (n/a on the stick version) it's a little easier to get consistency. I too bought the TL-S for it's balanced attributes and excellent value for the price. "
"xrunner2","April 2007"," The FWD wheel hop, tire spinning and torque steer make achieving those times in a TL on city streets a white knuckle experience compared to a relative walk in the park for a 3 series. In my humble observations, drivers doing all-out runs from stop lights (or stopped on a straight-flat rural road) and leaving rubber on the road are more likely in Mustangs, old Camaros, old Firebirds, Corvettes and other older American RWDs. Don't recall seeing BMWs, TLs, G35s, ISs doing this kind of stunt. Drivers of these types of vehicles don't desire that type of experience.Wife and I have had a number of high HP (and high torque)RWD V8 American brand pony cars and others in our younger days and may have done more than a few 0-60 runs leaving rubber on the pavement. Some of these were with 4-speeds, some with auto trans. But, with age and maturity, my/our desires have evolved to a touch of luxury but with some performance. Still like to explore back road twisties driving at a safe sensible rate and certainly never approaching the so-called 7/10ths level. The TL fully satisfies our needs, as a matter of fact two TLs - an 04 and an 07. These TLs do have more than adequate power to pass safely on the rural 2-lane roads in our area. TL, with FWD, also satisfies our winter driving needs. "

Try another quote, this one from Edmunds test of an 04 TL:""The TL feels extremely confident on the street, but it took several runs through our slalom to confirm its status as one of the best-handling front-wheel drivers we've sampled. The steering is properly weighted and offers stellar feedback. The engine's broad torque range and progressive throttle response made powering through the slalom easy, and the smart chassis/suspension tuning allowed us to place the car easily between cones. Technically, it may not be as ""fun"" as a BMW 3 Series, but it obviously goes through the slalom just as rapidly. &#151; Karl Brauer""That was the 2004 model, and the 2007 has been improved in handling.I had a 1984 Prelude (without air initially) and was impressed with its handling for a FWD. Putting in air in 1988 did affect handling a little. R&T did a road test of the 1984 (in 1984) and gave a very favorable report on its handling. Its 5-speed trans was very smooth and it along with the clutch never had a problem in 195K miles. "

"edwardsf","April 2007"," Everytime I read some of the above happy owner TL posts, I consider doing another test drive of the TL. Then I am reminded why it was not the car for me - exactly what you said: a little heavy, too big (turning radius), too much torque steer (plus no fold down back seat). That said, value/quality/tech/emissions/speed wise, I don't think any other ELLP is close to the TL.The funny part is that the car that feels right for me is one that is often belittled here because it is not as fast as most other ELLPs, an A4 2.0T Quattro. It is not nearly as fast or value laden as the TL or G35, but it has a lighter feel and is more nimble on country roads and has good midrange torque. That is, it has a better feel for me. Most of the other ELLPs are too small in the interior (3 Series, G35, IS) or are too pricey (3 Series, IS 350). But it is that ""feel"" that is the most important factor and is certainly more important than 0-60. BTW, I am glad I was not alone in some frustration at the HP/0-60 criteria that most mags and posters rely on. I don't get the subtraction argument either. When I must pass 3 RVs on an uphill two lane in the mountains, I am not redlining but instead am poking along behind them at the time I make my move. "

I am 6-2 and have a long torso and I fit in the A4 better than any ELLP. While the TL and the G35's entire cabins seem bigger, they balance the space between front and back, thus leaving the front smaller than the A4. Also, because of the rakish front windshield design of the TL and G35, instead of looking out the window, I am looking at the visor. The IS and TSX have the least leg/head/nose room of all and the Bimmer is in between. But the Bimmer, even more than any other ELLP, seems to be built for a small person. I fit okay in the 3 series, as it is designed very well, but everything is close to me and I feel too snug. A couple of other advantages of the A4. Quattro is better and more affordable than AWD on other ELLPs. The A4 has the best gas mileage of the group, although the 328 and the TL are close. (The G35 is awful). I am going to be ordering an Avant (an ELLPWAG?) and only the thousands more 3 series has a wagon.

I currently drive a car that I would defy anyone to fit into with the front seat moved all the way forward. It doesn't go so far back as I would prefer, but when it is all the way back (that would be 100% of the time), the nonexistant person behind me has plenty of leg room.I developed a Jones for Audi 5 or so years ago, after driving several rentals in Europe.

"circlew","April 2007"," I would guess Porsche's AWD system are acceptable as well. Here is a comment regarding the '03:The C4S offers all the plus factors of the more expensive Turbo but without the added hassles of the auspuffer. The 3.6 liter's power output of 320 ponies is more than sufficient to merge in any kind of traffic, and three-digit cruising on the right roads is where a thoroughbred like the C4S feels most at home. The main selling point of the C4S comes down to one simple point: The handling characteristics are nothing short of phenomenal. For a car the size and weight of the C4S to perform in the manner of a Lotus 7, and do it in comfort, is a huge achievement. After all, we live in a world where all-wheel drive is more of a catchy sales slogan and falls empty with what it promises. Not the C4S. The all-wheel drive makes a strong case that all 911 variants should send power through all four wheels.Probably not the purest, but OK for a daily driver.Regards,OW "
"edwardsf","April 2007"," Paging Mark of Cincinnatti. Mark has had 19 Audis and is religously against Audi FWD in favor of Quattro. I have owned 2 FWD (Non GM!) Saab Turbos with a lot of torque and thus a lot of torque steer. I owned an Audi 4000, which was a delightful FWD but it was a low powered, light car. But with 212 or 232 lb. of torque, the A4 FWDs will pull a bit. The Quattro, however, eats that torque up. How one who has driven both hard (as I did yesterday in test drives) can prefer FWD to Quattro, is baffling to me. The Quattro only weighs around 130lb. and diff in MPG is about 2 mpg. But both cars' MPG is way higher than competitors anyway (besides the 328i). "

Me too, me too, etc.Eventually, however, one would imagine that if AWD had disadvantages that overwhelmed the advantages that sales would decline.Like those who favor 2 driven wheels, I used to favor and frankly be hard pressed to understand the rise and rise and rise of automatic transmissions.I have come to believe -- and there is ample evidence both objective and subjective to support this -- that a good automatic is, well, ""good!""Years ago, when I got my ""poor man's quattro"" an American Eagle (an American Motors Concord with apparently ""Jeep"" underpinnings), I started to notice the obvious, ""I could go when others required a tow."" Then as my situation and finances changed, I noticed as I could afford AWD Audis and AWD BMW's (our first, a 1988 325ix), that I could also go in the twisties better, faster, safer and have an even bigger blast doing so than in any 2WD car I could afford.My boss, at the time, did have a 924 turbo that was also quite fun, but so many claimed it wasn't a proper Porsche.In any case, 5 driving schools later, 27 Audis and 2 BMW's later (virtually all AWD), countless articles read, etc etc etc -- I can simply advance the argument that almost all flavors of AWD are popular, are growing more popular, have been criticized (by those who are paid to write), have been less criticized and finally have been praised and ultimately virtually cherished in large measure by the paid automotive writers and racers alike.Audi and BMW's renditions of this technology are different. They each have their champions. If you don't like AWD don't buy it.AWD continues to advance, as noted, in features, function and popularity. Ultimately, I would not be shocked to find that it can cost less to insure an AWD car for its abilities to avoid ""driving incidents"" that would require car or human or property repair.AWD's racing history can be googled and it is certainly possible to discover the ""best"" performance and luxury cars are or can be AWD.Will there be an AWD M5? Beats me. A new generation RS6 -- IF it leaves the BMW in the dust -- could change even BMW's thought process on a go to market strategy for AWD in their highest performance cars.A couple of years ago, BMW mocked those who chose turbo-charging as a way to increase volumetric efficiency. The mantra from them used to be ""there's no replacement for displacement."" Check out the new campaigns, check out the sales figures for BMW AWD models. In some markets it has gone from nearly 0% to over 40% -- the reason, ostensibly is ""go anywhere,"" then the reason starts to shift to ""performance.""Kook-aid drinkers? I don't think this entirely accounts for the rise and rise and rise in acceptance, endorsement and praise of ""good"" AWD almost univerally by the amateurs and pros alike.If you don't like it, don't buy it.I'd just like to show those who don't buy it, my tail lights.

They claim that all cars, from a practical standpoint, lose value; but, they claim it is more difficult to move a USED manual transmission car, and that given two [in this case BMW's] similar cars, the USED AWD car will command a higher resale price.Perhaps this is only applicable above a certain climate line. In any case, it is your money.If you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission German car these days? Even closer to impossible to find an American car with a stick, ditto a Japanese make?My argument, for some time, always was that it was darn near a conspiracy for if people only drove (as in test drove) sticks that they would find they are more enjoyable.These days, despite Consumer Reports claim as to the poor reliability of Mercedes, the dropping reliability of BMW's and the slight rise of Audis in that regard, I believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. Some of them exact little if any penalty on mileage. Some, likewise exact no or virtually no acceleration penalty; and the argument I decided to stop fighting seemed to have more to do with ""population density"" in so many places taking the ""enjoyment"" out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, program the navigation system and fiddling with the ""joy stick"" controls of so many of these cars.I am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and I'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or AWD didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?Just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of AWD was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change? Or, are you really more about #1 than #2 and #3.Frankly, for me, life's too short to drive a 2WD car and it would take a huge economic disincentive to stop honing in ONLY on AWD versions.The fact, apparently, that the new CTS can be had with AWD but not AWD plus a manual transmission is a bit of a downer, but if the car is sweeet, I'd probably overlook that. Finding a 335xi or 535xi stick shift to test drive will be darn near impossible -- so if the magic lease genie makes me a deal I can't refuse, I might be forced to order a car I can't test drive and take the chance (small though it would be) that the stick shift is unsatisfactory.Drive it like you live. :shades: "
"fedlawman","April 2007"," Mark, consider that BlueGuy lives in San Diego - pretty tough to justify an AWD sedan down there.I happen to agree with both of you in that, AWD is a value adder in many markets that see inclement weather, or in the case of Audi, it does mitigate some of the negative FWD handling characteristics on their heavier, softer cars. On the other hand, I haven't driven an A3 with Sport Package, but I suspect it's pretty tight and light on it's feet, and I could see the added weight and driveline friction of AWD being a negative there.Finally, I wouldn't say that anyone shopping/owning a car in this segment is a ""purist."" These cars, by their very nature, are unpure thanks to their luxury, soundproofing, weight, and power-assisted everything. A purist would drive an RX-8 or Evo IX before choosing one of these leviathans. I think some people want to try to stay on the ""purer"" end of the scale and would prefer a FWD A3 2.0T to an AWD A3 3.2 Quattro - others feel the opposite but both are valid. If I still lived in Southern California, I don't think I could justify buying a 3660# A3 Quattro when there's another, identical looking A3 on the lot that is 400 lbs lighter, is more fun to drive, and costs thousands less.There is a huge market for AWD sedans out there, but they still aren't for all people and all markets.

"blueguydotcom","April 2007"," they claim it is more difficult to move a USED manual transmission car,Key words: they - salespeople - claim it. I've sold many manual cars. Recently when I put my 330i manual on swapalease I had 9 people contact me to take over the lease (over 50 people contacted me with questions). It was a deluge of people and in every case they mentioned the manual transmission. Kd and others who have sold bimmers privately can attest to the drawing power of the manual. Never owned an automatic car and I always seem to sell my cars quickly; this is probably because I'm getting manuals in fun-to-drive vehicles; my cars attract enthusiasts. and that given two [in this case BMW's] similar cars, the USED AWD car will command a higher resale price.It cost more to begin with, so naturally it will command a higher resale value. Navi will also increase the used car price; but never forget it added tremendously to the purchase price. $2100 navi = 2262 cost to the first buyer. in CA. Sell the car and get 1600 more because it had navi, well you just lost $600. Was it worth it?If you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission German car these days?Haven't had any problems. But then again, I either order my cars or buy versions intended for enthusiast's. My 03 330i 6MT was bought off the lot. Bro-in-law's 03 325 was a manual too - off the lot. 06 330i was ordered. 07 cooper s was off-the-lot with a manual.  I believe automatic transmissions to be reliable.If you mean needing or repair at 120k instead of 80k, maybe. It's still extremely expensive to fix an auto tranny and getting pricier all the time. There is no sense in paying 1200 extra for something that could end up with a 4-5-6k bill later. The manual comes in the base price and at most it'll require a new clutch at 100-150k miles.have more to do with ""population density"" in so many places taking the ""enjoyment"" out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, program the navigation system and fiddling with the ""joy stick"" controls of so many of these cars.No liquids allowed in the car, nothing to fiddle with (no cds, no navi) and phone is on bluetooth. I drive in LA with manuals; it's not a big deal. Like the unreliability of a BMW, I'll gladly take 85 % moments of unhappiness for 15% of bliss.I am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and I'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or AWD didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?How could AWD be lighter? It has more parts.How could it not impact fuel economy? It has more parts creating drag.how could AWD be cheaper to maintain? It has more parts.Replace AWD with automatic and you get the same thing.Just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of AWD was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change?

"plekto","April 2007"," These days, despite Consumer Reports claim as to the poor reliability of Mercedes, the dropping reliability of BMW's and the slight rise of Audis in that regard, I believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. ****If you look at the reliability for Mercedes in Europe, you see that they aren't considered unreliable at all - far from it, in fact. So, what gives?- Europe uses the smaller engines and turbo diesels. These are bulletproof designs and work well. The bloated versions we get in the U.S. are only a little faster but are half as reliable.- Europe uses 90%+ manuals. The automatics are made 110% for rental fleets for tourists and the like. As such, they are whatever cheap *chrysler* junk they can fit in them - simmilar to how much GM's rental trim cars stink compared to their non-rental units like a Lucerne CXS.So the easy way to solve it is to get the Euro engine and the Euro trans. Case in point - the Mercedes C230K. If you bought it with manual and the 1.8L supercharged engine, it was a beautiful car. Reliable, cheap enough to fix, good handling(being 100lbs lighter up front than the 2.4 or 3.2 engine), and nearly 35mpg.This also works with imports. Almost all of Japan also drives manuals. So manuals in imports tend to be quite decent. The mega-speed automatic in a Camry? 3500-4000 to fix. Egads, that's an astounding repair bill. In fact, the market for a used car with automatic with anywhere over 70-80K on it is miserable because the cost of a new transmission has to be factored in in the next year or two.I never had a problem selling any car with manual. The fact is that the number of people who want manuals is always the same as it has been - about 30%. But with so few choices, most of them settle for auto-manuals or automatics. So there is a huge pent-up demand for anything the least bit sporty or luxurious with stick. Try to get a price on a Porsche 928 or 968 with stick - gosh - it's 2K more than the automatics, easily - and you better buy it this HOUR becaue it'll be gone by tommorrow. A RX-8? The automatics rot on the lot because everyone wants stick. Mazda is getting smarter, though, and offering about 30-40% manuals in most of its sportier cars.The local Mercedes dealer when I was last there, told me that they love getting manuals because all they have to do is put it up on autotrader and it's sold in a day or two, every time.

"edwardsf","April 2007"," Fed - I drove an A3 2.0T AT FWD and then an A4 2.0T AT Quattro for an hour each, back to back on empty country roads. The A3 was more exhilarating to drive. Its lower weight made it much more nimble and fast. But boy was I glad to get in the Quattro as I was b>exhausted from battling the A3's torque steer. If I could have two cars, the FWD A3 would be certainly be an option for 2 hour country drives, although I think I would instead get a Mini or a TR6 or a 2002 (1972, of course!). As I said, I loved my light nimble 1972 Ford Capri. But I am also used to torque steer - I have had 2 Saab Turbos! And the A3 is a similar concept of the Capri but drains one like the Saab. The A3 has huge torque in a little FWD car - which equates with lots of tiring fun IF you drive hard ( I am going 60 on very windy roads in this test). But for my only car that I am driving 3-4 hours after a grueling mountain bike ride or a 13 mile hike, the A3 would be exhausting. The A4, though less nimble and connected to the road effortlessly pulls one out of corners making it easier to actually enjoy the whole driving experience (e.g. drive really fast). BTW, I am a big guy and the A3 is cramped, just like the 3 series, the IS, the TL, and the G35. If I were not 6-2, 190, I would be more comfortable contemplating 6 hour road trips in an A3. "
"fedlawman","April 2007"," I hear you Edward. Put in other words, AWD makes sport driving easier and more enjoyable for you because it takes some of the negative ""work"" (understeer, torque steer, etc.) out of it.I don't have a lot of time behind the wheel of AWD sports cars, but I've participated in plenty of DE's with Evo's and STi's on the track, and they are FAST - so fast that my M3 can't keep up with them. Speaking to owners though, I've also heard that they are ""too easy"" to drive, and not much fun.A FWD sport sedan can be very fun and satisfying once you figure out the ""magic"" of driving them properly - brake later on corner entry, trail brake deeper into the corner, turn sharper to a later apex, and straighten the wheel for track out sooner so you can get on the gas. It's a different line than conventional RWD, but once you master it, it can be just as quick as a ""RWD line"" - though I admit, it's not as much fun.I suspect the A4 Quattro gives the driver a very planted and confidence inspiring feeling - and it feels good to push a car hard and get that unflappable ""is that all you've got?"" response. I hear where you're coming from, but for me (and a few others here, I enjoy having limits that are attainable (and exceedable). I want to get sideways, have a ""dialogue with the pavement through the tires, and be able to control/induce understeer, 4-wheel drift, and oversteer with gentle finessing of the throttle and steering wheel. It's not going to happen on a car with multiple differentials that automatically transfer torque in varying amounts to all four wheels. "

"edwardsf","April 2007"," Great post. Thanks. My adrenalin has mainly come from riding 30 mph down a rocky singletrack on a 23 lb. vehicle that is definitely on the edge of control. So I can sort of understand the concept. I pushed my Saab pretty hard but rarely would it be skidding and that does make me uncomfortable. Perhaps if I went to the track and did a course, I would have a greater appreciation and comfort with having 4 wheels drift. I do know that I drive harder in country roads than anyone I know, so I would guess that 99% of the drivers - even of ELLPS - do not drive their cars like you do. A question. Don't AWD cars have limits too? When I test drove the other day, I fishtailed the Quattro a tiny bit coming out of a 10 mph loop. "
"fedlawman","April 2007"," ""The RWD line is still more fun for me.""In my experience, driving the ""RWD line"" in a FWD car gives you abundant understeer as you try to apply power while cornering. You can't accelerate and turn in a FWD car like you can with RWD, so the key to fast lap times with FWD is to keep the steering wheel pointed straight as long as possible through the corner (imagine the peak of a triangle superimposed over the corner to illustrate minimal time spent turning). The entry side of the triangle is longer and bends deeper into the corner because you're (trail)braking (more traction in front and even some oversteer in a more neutral FWD car). The exit side of the triangle is shorter and arrow straight so you can get on the gas sooner and harder.Have fun with the Mini! "
"fedlawman","April 2007"," ""Perhaps if I went to the track and did a course, I would have a greater appreciation and comfort with having 4 wheels drift.""I have all-season tires on my M3 for the street (Pirelli PZero Nero), so 4-wheel drifting is almost an ""every day"" event for me :blush: . I do it on a particular ""15 MPH"" 270 degree uphill corner that is near my home. I come down a long 50 MPH hill in 4th gear, heel&toe down to 2nd gear, and then steer into the corner under steady throttle. The pavement on this corner is so smooth and new, the tires lose grip very gradually and progressively - it's easy to ride on the edge of traction at 30 MPH without any drama.Just don't ask me how fast I can take this corner with my RA-1's :surprise: "
"fedlawman","April 2007"," ""Don't AWD cars have limits too? When I test drove the other day, I fishtailed the Quattro.""All cars have limits.

Thus the whole issue of going against the RWD grain; it's hard to rewire myself to put weight on the front tires. After BMWCCA courses I'm still locked into keeping weight settled and avoiding nose-plow as all the power will disappear in a flash.Although I learned to drive on FWD cars when I was 10, my mom and dad had RWD cars, so I always found their cars more entertaining to push.

"markcincinnati","April 2007"," I special order virtually all of my cars, as does my wife. In 2002 I ordered a loaded 2003 allroad with a 6 speed manual, thinking it would be my last stick shift car. When I shopped for the replacement, in 2005, the A6 was only offered with the [much improved] 6 speed tip (which still can be made to demonstrate a tiny bit of lag.)30%? Now, I HOPE you are correct. If 30% of people want or ""lean"" toward stick shifts, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a BMW 5 series (5 thirty or twenty something) with a manual. The largest dealer in Ohio, the 10th largest in the US has a huge inventory (and we have two BMW dealers here in Cincinnapolis, ditto the other one) and there are zero sticks to test drive?If there would be 30% of the market who would buy a stick, wouldn't at least 3 cars out of an inventory of 100 be expected to be stick?Our sales rep called me to say ""inbound 5 series, unclaimed, stick shift, come and drive it this Saturday."" Of course, I show up and the car sold as it was being unloaded from the truck.Prompting me to say, ""if the sticks sell virtually instantly, why not inventory one or two?"" The guy who buys them overhears my question and says, ""because they sit and sit on the lot, which decreases my floor plan.""Cognitive dissonance? Yep.When Audi surveys me (as they seem to do with regularity), they ask me (having had 28 Audis) which one is or was my favorite.I tell them my 1995 S6 was the most fun and -- with respect to 1995 -- the best car I've ever had. Then I say, the 2005 A6 is a better car in almost every way when compared to the 1995 S6. The S6 was just plain more fun to drive -- it was a stick shift with a ""fun"" 5 cylinder turbo.My survey is probably flagged and placed into the weirdo-bin. "
"blueguydotcom","April 2007"," Mark, many dealerships won't order sticks for off-the-lot because they know two things:1. Stick buyers will definitely order2. Off-the-lot buyers will end up paying for more options, thus the profit margins are higher with auto-equipped cars. Again, there's a reason used BMWs with sticks are easy to sell - the demand is greater than the supply on lots. All the people that wanted my e90 wanted it expressly because it was one of the few on swapalease with a manual. "

The total market has so few manuals in it(rental fleets skew the percentage greatly, btw) that the few makes that do offer it are mobbed by buyers.As to why they don't order manual BMWs? I don't know - the local dealer does - and told me he tries to get them used since its the automatics that sit forever on the used lot. Of course, he advertizes the car on cars.com the day it comes in, which is like putting your house on the MLS - millions of people find it and the calls come pouring in.My guess, though, is profit margins. Most makes only can be had with manual at the lowest trim level and with the newer manu-matics, they probably feel that they can convince you to buy one.(have both types of customers covered). I really suggest you get a 5-speed in a BMW, though - the fun and the resale alone are worth it. "
"markcincinnati","April 2007"," Well, this does sort of make sense, but -- if I knew that 30% of the buying public wanted some feature or even a specific color combo, you can bet I would order that.The local (SW Ohio) BMW dealer says AWD sales have now passed 40%, and that the growth has slowed due to ""allocation"" (availability, by another name, sort of.)I cruise up and down the lot and the butts of the Bimmers are Something Something Something ""Xi"" and then one or two M's or a 6 series or 7 which (at this juncture, but not for long) are still exclusively RWD. The next gen of the 7, so they say, will be offered with ""X"" however.Anyway, they fill the lot, the overflow lot and the inbound queue with as many AWD Bimmers as they are allowed.Yet when ONE stick is ordered (almost as if it were an accidental order) it sells sight unseen before your's truly gets to even whiff that new car scent.They sell 1,200 new Bimmers a year. You'd think they could ""order"" without a customer (i.e. for inventory) 36 of them per year in various flavors in stick.When we got our X3 -- we HAD to order it; and, you're correct, there was a ""strippie"" X3 2.5 offered -- but we wanted the 3.0, sat nav, sport package and the bun warmers and high zoot sound system.Plenty like that with the horrible stutter tronic of the day -- the good news?

Yes, a few but I'll bet there is some abuse if one can't get 150K miles from an AT - IF it is serviced at the recommended intervals. The oil is the heart of the AT, much more than lubrication. The oil under pressure is what makes the AT operate. The filter needs to be changed at those intervals. Do not get the Jiffy Lube suck out of just the oil. The filter replacement is critical to extended life.Regards,OW "

Acura (2004 TL 6-speed) Perhaps Habitat needs to keep 04 TL to same amount of miles as his Max to see how it stacks up.Don't think that current Maxima is considered entry level lux perf, but I will add my 2 cents on it along with current gens Acuras.Have a 97 Maxima SE with 181K miles on it and it has been mostly bullit proof. Recently had 2 oxygen sensors replaced on it. Other than normal maintainence (tires, batt, etc) it has been an outstanding car. Probably the best ever in my life. Also have a 2004 TL (80+K Miles) and it has had absolutely zero problems. Don't know if we will keep till 180K miles to see how it stacks up to Maxima.Have some other vehicles including an 07 TL. Guess that is a comment on selecting from current crop of cars in this class. Did not consider 07 G35 or any other RWD because FWD for winter driving very important to us.Years ago, we did consider and test drive 01 Max SE and later the redesigned 04 Max SE. We test drove those without sales persons on back roads and both wife and I concluded that our 97 Max handled better than the 01 or 04. Granted the 04 had a lot of HP, but it was too much HP for the chasis. One word to describe the 04 Max - ponderous. In both cases we opted for Acura TL - 01 and 04. The 01 TL had zero problems at trade-in with 70K miles.Think that 95-99 gen of Maximas had higher quality, fit and finish, than later and current gens. Believe they were built in Japan and had higher levels of materials including the paint. When at Nissan dealer for oil changes over the years, would notice a lesser quality of paint finish and cheaper looking interiors on Maxs compared to the old 97. "
"habitat1","May 2007"," Your perception that the generation 4 Maxima (1995-1999) was higher quality than later generations is absolutely true. They were the last to be built in Japan. In the case of my 1995 w/ 155k miles, with a good wash and wax, it's finish looks better than just about any 2-3 year old American product. And, unfortunately, probably better than my US-built TL will look at 5-6 years, if I keep it that long. Rocky, I would put my 1995 Maxima SE 5-speed as a relatively better car, for it's era and the price, than my 2004 TL 6-speed. No doubt the TL has a lot more gizmos, do-dads, updated interior etc. But when it comes to long term reliability and structural build quality, I think the 4th Generation Maxima, especially the 1995-1997 model years, were exceptional. Far superior to their competiton of that era - US built Camrys and Accords - and better than the TL of that day. I would even say, FWD notwithstanding - that they were competitive with the 189 hp 328i in performance. Unfortunately, Nissan screwed up the current Maxima so horribly that it bears no resemblence to the ""4 door sports car"" of 1995. "

"johnny420","May 2007"," ""In my experience, driving the ""RWD line"" in a FWD car gives you abundant understeer as you try to apply power while cornering. You can't accelerate and turn in a FWD car like you can with RWD, so the key to fast lap times with FWD is to keep the steering wheel pointed straight as long as possible through the corner (imagine the peak of a triangle superimposed over the corner to illustrate minimal time spent turning). The entry side of the triangle is longer and bends deeper into the corner because you're (trail)braking (more traction in front and even some oversteer in a more neutral FWD car). The exit side of the triangle is shorter and arrow straight so you can get on the gas sooner and harder.""You're going to have to show me how to do this sometime.  "
"xrunner2","May 2007"," I totally believe Habitat as the 90s Nissans were rock solid, IMHO. Somewhat sporty, could take a beating and maintenance was infrequent and very cheap. Maybe Carlos Ghosn cut back on engineering and quality of parts to cut costs. Nissan was a good engineering company in past, which was great for us enthusiasts, but perhaps they did not price cars to recover costs properly. They were at price levels to compete in their segments, but costs got out of hand?Interior and dashboard of our 97 SE looks, feels very good after 10 years. Original exhaust sys also, with 181K miles. Mentioned 97 Max paint before and think that it's shine/depth just as good, maybe better than our 04, 07 TLs. Changed air filters a couple of times (other times dealer does along with oil, trans oil, plugs, etc) and remember that I was impressed about the sound engineering of the parts assoc with attaching the filter. Have always done my own brake jobs (pads, rotors/calipers as reqd) and was pleased in the engineering done there also. And, the famous V6 engine, still runs strong, miniscule oil consumption, and sounds great on acceleration, kind of a low growl. Nissan somehow got rid of this growl starting about year 2001. Sometimes think the sounds coming from 97 Max engine are more fun/enjoyable than that from the 04/07 TLs.Have not test driven a G35. If they use VQ V6 in that car, does engine have a nice growl on acceleration, or has it been muffled as on the recent Maxs. "

"habitat1","May 2007"," ""Well, I think I will, because if I ever win this State lottery, a Porsche dealer will see me within the next week."" That's what I thought about 15 years ago. But fortunately, I neither wasted my money on lottery tickets, nor on buying and trading ELLPS's every 3-4 years.I'm NOT suggesting to anyone that they run to the Porsche dealership and cross shop a 911 with a 335i or IS350. However, consider what your money bought you 15 years ago in 1992 (base MSRP's):$16,865 - Honda Accord LX$19,995 - Nissan Maxima GXE$23,275 - BMW 318i$24,340 - Acura Vigor$25,385 - Infiniti M30$67,750 - Porsche C2 Coupe$76,750 - Porsche C2 Cabriolet$86,780 - Porsche C4 CabrioletAs you can see, even a base 911 in 1992 ran 3 times the price of a base 3 series. Back then $25,000 was a heck of a lot to spend for a sedan.Now, 15 years later, in this ELLPS forum, we are all discussing ""entry level"" cars in the $35k to $50k range. A well equiped 335i runs twice what a 318i ran in 1992. Arguably, the 335i is twice the car of a 318i, but the dollars have still doubled. Except for Porsche. The base C2 Coupe runs $72,800, a mere $5k and 7% more than in 1992. Not to mention that, now, Porsche dealers will even discount. They didn't have a German word for that concept in 1992. My dealer recently sold a reasonably optioned, brand new 911 C2 for $69,000. Like I said, I'm NOT advocating the 911 as a potential replacement for the family sedan. But relative prices have changed a lot. It wasn't that long ago (1994) when I bought a 1995 Maxima SE for $21,000 and nearly had an anxiety attack trying to justify to myself the extra $3,000 it cost over a 4-cylinder Altima GXE. Now $3,000 is barely the cost of a navigation system or Mark Levison sound system.Want a Porsche 911 in a decade? Buy a Honda Accord now and keep it for 10 years. Put the difference that you would have spent in your ""future fun account"". No lottery tickets needed. "

"habitat1","June 2007"," Mind you, I have NEVER owned a BMW and I still think my 1995 Nissan Maxima SE 5-speed was one of the best cars I've ever owned, but that Motor Trend article is so full of crap I can smell it coming out of my computer.First, the absolutely pathetic (I agree mayberryguy) excuse for comparing slushboxes that Motor Trend quotes: they are more ""popular"". For crap's sake, you Motor Trend idiots, you are comparing two performance oriented coupes (not the more ""popular"" sedans or some Camry/Accord lookalike) that cater more to the ""enthusiast"" buyer. And then you do the test of slushbox against slushbox and actually think any serious enthusaist gives a crap? Save the trees and stop printing such garbage.But, guess what, the BMW still wins in EVERY single performance category. Acceleration, skidpad, braking (tie actually). And it gets almost 20% better gas mileage. Pretty easy to see who the ""winner"" is in this slushbox comparo from my seat. Oh, but wait, the BMW costs $8k more than the Infiniti. Well, I hate to break it to those MT rocket scientists, but if you take BMW's 20% better fuel economy, BMW's included maintenance and BMW's much better resale value there is NO real difference in cost over 4-5 years. But that's way above their math skills.As best I can tell, the marketing department of Nissan paid Motor Trend, big time, for a complete BS comparison. If they didn't, they should send Motor Trend a big box of chocolates. Too bad, because I would have actually liked to see an honest, unbiased comparison of the G37 coupe against the 335i coupe equiped the way anyone who really wants to DRIVE these cars would - with a manual transmission. And without some assinine concluding comment like ""considering the micro performance margins and macro price differential"". MT needs to take a macro walk off a micro pier on this one. Utter crap.

Hint: these are not the equivalence to the 911 or even the Boxster. :P However, I do agree with you 150% that this comparo has BS written all over it. How can the car wins in all categories loss a head-to-head comparison? MT can spin it anyway they want but this one will be too hard to justify. I guess MT is desperate for more subscribers and by ""dethroning"" an obvious current benchmark will no doubt generate some heat.

That's pretty darned good. And considering most other test I've seen of the 335 auto have it hitting 60 in under 5 secs, maybe it was a slow track day and the G37 is even better than the 5.4 would indicate.

I still think they will charge less than people are thinking. Because for almost the same money the 3 series is considerably more useable.

Oh and this is MSRP not what TMV is since it doesn't exist on the 2008's 3 series the 5 series is 2008 prices and the 1 series is a 2008.

Options will boost up the prices. I still think it's high for the market but what the market will bear is another thing.I think a lower price will draw in more customers and new blood but I'm not BMW.

It's car used by average guys, accountants commuting to work. It's not a Blue Collar muscle car but BMW's are pretty common place. Th e1 series might be great but it's got some work ahead of itself to remain the class leader. Price for small cars really matters and the 1 series is small. If the price is big it will be cross shopped heavily and while many guys can and will throw $35K at one that won't be common after a while.Low or high it doesn't matter They sell the hatchbacks here and I can call up and get a price but it's about $35K for a 4 door hatch with a 4 cyl. But cars are all overpriced here especially foreign cars but I think BMW is actually made here. It's like 1.5 million PhP a bit over $32K actually for their lowest base model. Very few sales tho and imports are a lot cheaper. Here you'll pay $36,740 for a 2007 V6 Honda Accord! No chance of a discount, no free floor mats, nothing, pay or don't buy it. The price is set in stone. Oh wait you do get free window tint, sorry for the error.It's going to be interesting to see what the 1 series MSRP's at and that will also position BMW for the future.For me if it's too high for what you get I'll just buy something else. :shades: "
"stevecebu","June 2007"," then it is a point that has no bearing on the discussion. we are discussing it in terms of MSRP on the 1-series, NOT street prices. Comparing street prices of one car with sticker on another is never valid. the point is where it will be priced in relation to the manufacturer's own lineup. Whether or not a 3-series coupe will need to be discounted because of the existence of the 1-series is a WHOLE other topic, and THAT is where we could compare actual sale prices of other cars (and, honestly, not a bad discussion, i don't think). Absolutely spot on! How can we compare all options and trim or invoice and rebates and everything else? We can't! I don't know why some guys don't understand MSRP. It's the easiest way to make a close guess on the value of a car that has yet to be released.street prices are meaningless because a dealer in one area does volume and discounts heavily and another wants full MSRP.The 1 series has to slot under the 3 series, if it overlaps by too much then it will eat into the sales.I know we see pretty much eye to eye on this. I don't know why some people to expect it to be an overpriced car which will not hold up in the market place at a high price point.The 3 series will probably not compete too heavily as it's a much larger car and more luxury for more money. That is why the price has to be low on the 1 series. It won't do any good if it steals sales from the 3 series. It's supposed to add sales.You're right, it is a good discussion.  "
"stevecebu","June 2007"," Last time I checked, when a car ""retails"" for a certain amount, that pretty much means MSRP, not ""street prices"". Not always, MSRP is a figure the car manufacturer determines the car *should* retail for. It's a given number that in the real world has little meaning due to rebates and discounts and haggling and leasing andtrade-ins etc....But MSRP is set by the manufacturer, not the dealer. What a car actually retails for can be very different than MSRP.MSRP in not an arbitrary number. "
"ggrif","June 2007"," I am considering purchasing Certified '03 E320 or a '04 C240 from a local dealer in Louisville. The E320 has very low miles, 24K, while the C240 has 36K. The price difference is about $5,000, but I am torn as to whether to go with a new model with average mileage or the older model with low mileage. This would be my first luxury car purchase. Any thoughts out there? "
"habitat1","June 2007"," While neither car is my cup of tea, I think the E class is a much more substantial car than the C class. Unfortunately, both have had their share of quality and reliability issues, in the years you are considering. But my marketing director's former 2002 E300 Turbodiesel felt like a true luxury car - quiet, solid, nice interior. Her assistant's C240 was, IMO, noisy, less solid feeling and a downscale interior by comparison. I do not think of the C class as a ""luxury car"". Whatever your decision, I would not put much value in 36k miles vs. 24k. I would actually rather buy a car that has been driven regularly, with a good mix of highway miles, than one only used for short hops. I have 155k mostly highway miles on my 13 year old Nissan Maxima and it has less mechanical wear and tear than cars with 1/3 that mileage driven mostly in the city. "

"dan12","July 2007"," I just read some posts that aluminum trim gets really hot in the summer. Now that I think about it, that makes a lot of sense. Did I make a mistake ordering my car with black interior and aluminum trim? Should I have gone with wood instead (and maybe gray interior)? The wife hates the wood, but I'd rather not fry in the summer. "
"qbrozen","July 2007"," In my experience, yes it does. "
"pv2","July 2007"," I think a bigger factor in heat is the black interior; not the aluminum trim. My prior car was a 2003 CL-S with black interior and there's a noticeable improvement with the lighter interior on my 2007 TL-S. No noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim. You might want to try a front window shade if it's parked in the sun. "
"qbrozen","July 2007"," No noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim.i believe carbon fiber is not known for retaining heat, however, and is the silver trim you speak of aluminum or painted plastic? The only car I really had a problem in was my 350Z. The aluminum shift knob was barely usable on a real hot day if the sun had been beating on it.You are right, of course, that a sunshade can help. But the aluminum will not absorb any less of the sun's rays in a light-colored interior. "
"texases","July 2007"," Like you say, most 'aluminum' trim is painted/plated/whatever plastic, so no difference there, but a solid metal gear shift knob will fry you (had one many years ago). You could take an appropriately-sized foam coffee cup to slip over it to keep the sun off, but it would still heat up. The problem with metal is not that it gets hotter (everthing inside will get to about the same temperature, except for what's in the sun) but that it conducts heat so well, so it can deliver all that heat rapidly to your hand, unlike plastic. So the black interior will be the bigger factor. Go to the max on legal, high-quality window tint for the side and rear windows (I wouldn't do the front) if you don't mind the reduced night vision, and get a good removeable widow shade. "
"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," Many cars with aluminum trim (BMWs and Cooper S - so yes it's real aloo-mini-um) and I've never noticed them as hot to the touch. "
"tayl0rd","July 2007"," Real aluminum doesn't retain heat, it repels it. [ok. Repel was the wrong choice of words.] That's why aluminum is used as heat shields on cars, etc. I have a car that has real aluminum trim and it [the trim] is never hot to the touch. It maintains a relatively constant temperature in hot or cold. With direct contact, heat will pass right through aluminum; with indirect contact, it just bounces off.I usually will pull aluminum foil straight out of a hot oven with my bare hands because it doesn't hold the heat of the oven. As long as you don't grab it where the hot food or cooking pan is, you're fine. "
"scottm123","July 2007"," Aluminum does not repel heat.The fact is that Aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat.What this means is that if Aluminum is placed near a heat source, it heats very quickly and holds its heat.Once the heat source is removed, it cools quickly as well.The reason you can hold the aluminum edges from the oven is because, as you open the oven door, the heat source is removed (hot air leaving oven) and replaced with cooler air.You can then hold the edges because the aluminum has cooled in that area.If aluminum repelled heat, aluminum oven bags would not work.Aluminum trim in a car can and will become very warm to the touch if the source of heat is constant, like a very hot interior, caused by the sun.Once the interior cools, the aluminum should cool as well, as long as the material behind the trim has cooled as well.

"snakesndafield","July 2007"," I've driven them all recently; 1st the BMW - everyone claims it is unequaled in handling. Who am I to argue. The steering is very weighty, possibly too much at low speeds for some. It does manage to feel very tight and extremely smooth all at once. Definitely the driver's car but if you're on city streets the whole time you might never notice. Lousy cupholders & average interior layout, but the backseat is surprising decent. 2nd the Lexus - I like it less each time. Interior is superb but I find it overly cramped even up front. There's no place to set your phone down. It's also slow and those are two bad strikes. I did think it had good steering weight, handles fairly well and cornered flat. To me, I liked the Audi best. It's not really any bigger but it feels less cramped. The little four banger is plenty quick and gets great mpg. My only problem with the Audi - it's tired, looks like it's been around forever (especially the interior which is the same one from like 1999) and will be replaced by a the newer, better model inside of a year. So it's out for me. Personally, I'm gonna get a used A6. HOpe this helps, these things helped me make my decision. "

"texases","July 2007"," I'd be worried that an IS250/AWD/AT might be a bit slow, lot of weight, small engine + AT. Just not what I'd want to spend that much money on for a car that aspires to 'performance'. But driving is the only way to tell. "

"louiswei","July 2007"," Audi A4 2.0T Quattro has similar HP as the IS250 AWD, has smaller engine. Don't know which one weighs more though. 328xi will no doubt be the performance king by a mile out of the 3. "
"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," A4 has torque in ample quantities compared to the 2.5 in the IS and with a $600 mod you can give the car 250 hp/280 ft-lbs of torque. On the AWD that'd get that car moving. "
"habitat1","July 2007"," My vote is for a 328i RWD. Unless you really need AWD (i.e. anticipate driving in snow on more than an occasional basis), you are paying a lot for AWD. It is heavier, less fuel efficient and, depending upon how long you keep the car, prone to more expensive maintenance and repairs down the road. The A4 Quatro is a heavy pig, IMO. I've been given one a couple of times as a loaner and was anxious to give it back. For all of the drooling others do over Audi's interiors, I just don't get it. I like the interior and ergonomics of my 2004 TL better. On the other end, I am spoiled by my 911, which has best ""German"" style interior and seats of any car, IMO.I have not driven the IS250 AWD but, as has been pointed out, it would likely be highest in reliabiity, but lowest in performance and driving dynamics, if that is of any importance. Plus, the rear seat is almost worth a 2+2 designation (closer to my 911 than TL in leg room)If I were in the market for a new sedan today, the 328/335 would likely be at the top of my short list. "
"plekto","July 2007"," My vote is for a previous generation 3 series, factory certified. *edit* Or two generations The new ones are like the new IS350 - bloated and heavy things with no soul anymore. Or wait and get the 3 series of old(idea-wise) in a new package when the 1 series comes out. "
"habitat1","July 2007"," Well, I think you might have to go back a couple generations, not just one, to get a 3 series that has the ""soul"" you are looking for.

"jzalkin","July 2007"," Here is my take with the following disclamer: I own a 2006 IS250 RWD and had a 2004 A4 Cab 1.8t before it.I chose the Lexus over the BMW because of value and comfort. I am in South FL and the roads are a grid system. Only handling I get to experience is 90 degree turns so the BMW handeling factor was out. The BMW was more and did not include a power seat and leather on the car I test drove. The Lexus luxury is the best quality wise and I continue to marvel at the leather (12 months and 23,000 miles later) - so smooth and soft. Lexus does luxury the best and will appeal to you if you value that. The Audi was great fun and I like the interior the best (the cab is better than the sedan), but quality was an issue. It maybe cliche to say about the German cars, but I always had a list of things that needed to be fixed under warr in the Audi from the start and even had to get them to cover the top when it was 1,500 miles out of warr and seperated from the rear window (2 years into ownership) Top would have been $6,000 to replace and I figured the car would be expensive to keep. The Lexus is much better than my Audi for the little things that go wrong and are annoying.The Lexus back seat is tight, but I have had adults in it every so often. Since it is not a weekly thing - not a major factor for me.I'll wrap it up by saying this:- Lexus for Luxury and peace of mind quality- BMW for logo and the privilage for paying a premium for it- Audi is about to be replaced, but maybe the best pricePS - My IS was $32,500+TTL including Premium, NAV, 18"" wheels, minor others. 75% Highway and have averaged 28.4mpg since new which is why the 250 and not the 350. "
"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," 'll wrap it up by saying this:- Lexus for Luxury and peace of mind quality- BMW for logo and the privilage for paying a premium for it- Audi is about to be replaced, but maybe the best price So basically, if you want a Toyota with a nicer badge and no back seat, get the IS. Of course a TSX or Camry V6 would offer all the same for a much lower price and give you a backseat. So really, if driving performance isn't important, why bother with an IS250? "
"jzalkin","July 2007"," I hope to not get into a pissing match so let me clarify.""if you want a Toyota with a nicer badge and no back seat, get the IS"" Please share the Toyota that Lexus just put the IS badge on to make a Lexus? The Lexus IS is based on the Lexus GS platform so it is not a glorified Toyota as you implied. The Lexus is more Luxurouis IMO (and most other including car mags) than the BMW. Just touch the inside of the A pillar to see what I mean. The BMW is better at handling which does me little good in South Florida since there are no winding roads (grid system)or even any hills. A perfect place for raw, straight line performance (my old Ford Cobra was a lot of fun).The BMW costs more for similar equipment and has a worse reliability record. Thus, there is a premium price to be paid for the logo compared to Lexus,Infiniti, Audi for similar equipment. I would say the same for Mercedes as well.If he had mentioned the TSX, I would summed it up as the best value, but without the style or Luxury as some of the others. For me the IS250 is perfect since it offers Luxury, quality, reliability, style (subjective), and gas efficiency. For me  the BMW offored less luxury, less reliability, better handling, so-so styling (sedan - subjective), run-flats (I consider a negative) and increased cost.BTW - The 3 series back seat is small (slightly larger than the IS) and not ideal for frequent adult use either. For that the 5, CTS, GS is ideal.PS - Equipping the 328 as my Lexus Edmunds shows MSRP to be $40,300 with invoice of $37,120. I paid $500 over invoice (+TTL) for my Lexus at $32,500. Is the BMW worth $5,000 more - that is question only the person buying can answer. "

"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," I do agree that there are people who put a logo factor on the BMW, which is weird to me, but I would hardly say that the Lexus offers peace of mind.

For the entire 3 years I had the 330i, I only had the sunroof stick, they regreased it and it was fine. for the 18 months I have had my IS250, there have been countles problems, and they fight me on them. BMW always said ""i'll be right back"" and then it was fixed. Lexus finds a way to try to blame me for it. The Audi, I no noting about.My friend put it to me this way, cars are mostly computerized now a days, so would I want a computer made in Germany or made in Japan. I chose the latter but what I didn't account for is that all the mechanical items on the IS250 are cheap and made to be replaced frequently. Lexus sees that as big $$$$ for the American market. BMW still believes in making a quality product out of pride which will last. and they make a decent amount (enough and to not gouge) for it. "

As a current IS owner and many others, we have different dealership experience than you do.Why are you so scared that people will say bad things about your IS250 that you have to send ""secret"" messages and crash an ongoing discussion about the cost of owning an IS250 to a new buyer?First of all, I am not scared. Second, I don't have an IS250 and last but not least, if you can't take the previous ""secret"" post as a joke then I have nothing to add here. Dude, I have been here (ELLPS board) way longer than you do and there is a reason for my previous joke. I am pretty sure habitat1 gets it... :P Oh, by the way, the previous discussion wasn't about ""the cost of owning an IS250"" like you stated. It's about a comparison between the IS, 3er and A4. You, my friend, made it a cost discussion in order to pursuit your own agenda.Relax, no one is here to hurt you. But on the same note I would say if you don't like the bad with the good statments, then why are you here?LOL, like you are capable of hurting me. Dude, you are way too full of yourself. As for bad and good statements...my philosophy is always: Give credit when credit is due. "
"jzalkin","July 2007"," Every car maker has it's bad examples. dontbuylexus has one. It comes down to Odds. Odds are that Lexus will build a better car and JD Power proves it as well as CR. There are good dealers and bad as well for all makers. According to Edmunds:Lexus IS250 5 year maintenance cost: $4,3051$364 2$839 3$554 4$1,527 5$1,021 Total:$4,305 BMW 328 5 year maintenance cost: $3,0981$0 2$0 3$0 4$1,009 5$2,089 Total$3,098 So that means that BMW costs more to maintain (compare year 4 & 5), but gives you some freebees. Savings will vary on miles driven and length of ownership. I drive 24,000 miles/year so I take the longer view. Drove out of my free Audi service in less than 2 years. If I could get the BMW at $500 over invoice like my Lexus; I would still be ahead $4,000 +/- over 5 years (less for me due to mileage) with the Lexus. The BMW would also have a bigger chance of failing. Not all Lexus are perfect and not all BMW will fall apart. It is just the odds that the Lexus will be more reliable (and cost less) than BMW.Sorry for your bad experience, but it does mean that I now have a mathematically better chance that mine is perfect since yours is not. A weird way to look at it, but mathematically true. "
"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," I agree about the bad and good experiences and that there are lemons with every mfr.The point I was making was beyond the dealer. Meaning if neither the BMW or Lexus dealers could help you and you have to escalate it. BMW prides itself on taking care of their customers and Lexus is only about building the hype of quality and service. I've experienced both and i'v talked to others who feel the same.If nothing goes wrong The IS250 is a great car, but if something does, be prepared to fight Lexus on it and in a big way.BTW, as I stated the Mags' facts are never true, JD and CR dont have their facts straight on maint cost. and maint should be per mile and not per year for better acuracy.Here is the true cost from my dealer and all So Cal dealers charge the same: "

"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," The Lexus IS is based on the Lexus GS platform so it is not a glorified Toyota as you implied.Ah, no my point was: you don't care about handling, so why bother with a RWD car? you do care about luxury, quality and space (mentioned the backseat is small). A Toyota Camry, Hyundai Acara, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima and an Acura TSX offer all of those things: luxury, quality and space. What's wrong with those choices? If the 5k difference pushed you into an IS250, then the 5k gap from a TSX/Camry to IS250 probably would make a difference too. You sure the badge didn't play a little role? Just a wee bit? "

"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," Good Point kdI never trust those surveys or data from these type of sites. I would never trust data from a place who makes their profit from the advertisers who they are building the data about. I have been in advertising for 15 years and I know how it works. There is a chain where everyone scratches everyones back and the consumer is none the wiser.Another point is the Mercedes case study. They were it, as far as number one quality in the 1990's, but they have the worst (yes I did own one too) quality of the high-line cars lately. Everyone seems to think that it is because Chrysler bought them. That is not true. Daimler (a German company who has owned MB for a long time) bought Chrysler. The reason for the decline in quality was that Dr. Dieter (CEO)(yea that guy from the ads) saw that the company had an outstanding reputation and saw where he could cut corners on quality to make more $$$. This would take several years to ripple down and most consumers buy what they are told they can trust (ie name recognition and reputation) and not on the quality of the current model itself.Who today has an outstanding reputation built from the 1990's through to the 2000s, recently changed their body styles for the entire line and who has a new VP of the American division (Jim Farley)? Yes it's Lexus.People will see, they will ride out their reputation and new styling (which does look good btw) until the music stops and people start seeing them as the greedy corporate rats they are. People will only notice this when they notice that their Lexus cars are not as good as they used to be. This takes a few decades to happen. Just look at GM. They were at the top once and now where are they after blowing $1b on the EV1 then bucking under pressure of the oil companies.But it is easier for people to stick their heads in the sand and take what they are fed like good little mice.Like kd said a POS is a POS by any other name. at least if I got an Accord, I would've saved half my money.

The key is which of those things matter most to the buyer.I've come to the conclusion that many on the board (not intended for the poster I am replying to) are like those in politics and religion. They are at the extremes and think that their opinion is right for all others. Those are the people who should be ignored. Test for others - if you say: (Insert Brand X) is better in all ways than (Insert Brand Y) and you would be an idiot for choosing (Insert Brand Y); you are the person I am describing.In this topic: Value, Comfort, Speed, Handling, Reliability, Tech Toys, Size, and Panache are qualities that vary in each car and vary in importance to each person.Now for the fun debate part.My assessment of the BMW 3 series and Lexus IS:BMW leads: Speed (smaller engine; even on the larger), Handling, Size (slightly), PanacheLexus leads: Value, Comfort, Reliability, Tech ToysThose results are why I chose the Lexus and others have bought a BMWPS - I hope the Domestics improve and the new CTS seems to be a winner.

"louiswei","July 2007"," jzalkin, let me play the devil's advocate...(Disclaimer: I am a proud IS350 owner)BMW leads:Speed - well, yeah, by 2 tenth of a second but it is achieved by 2 low pressure turbos. Less moving parts in the engine bay is more ideal since it has less chance to break down and I will be cautious for a turbo engine's long time reliability. If 2 engines produce ""similar"" (not identical) power then I'd go for NA instead of force induced.Handling - hands down here.Size - For the people who rarely have people sitting in the backseat this point is moot. As for front leg room, the IS is almost 2.5 inches longer than the 3er.Panache - I guess people view BMW as a prestige brand but I see BMW as a performance first, luxury second kind of manufacture.Lexus:Value - Well, sort of, however a top of the line IS350 will run around $48K. To me that's only value when comparing to BMW and MB.Comfort - Hands down. However, handling is sacrificed in order to achieve that.Reliability - By a small margin. I personally consider reliability a moot point when comparing to import luxury brands. Well, maybe not Audi but BMW and Lexus are close enough to make this a non-argument.Tech Toys - Well, almost all brands offer enough tech toys these days. It all depends on if one's willing to pay for it or not. PS. I agree that the new CTS looks good. "

My definition of value is handling enjoyment per dollar. I could care less about tech toys, I just want the standard fare. "
"jzalkin","July 2007"," Logo buyers for all makes exist. Since there is no data on it, I have to go based on my experiences and assumptions. I think that more BMW owners have bought into the brand image/logo more than some other brands. Not most of the people on the board because they are the enthusiast. I think Lexus owner to a less degree since the reason to own a Lexus is not driving dynamic, but reliability, luxury, and comfort. For $32,500 I would be hard pressed to find the same for less. My mom owns the V6 Hybrid Accord ($30,000) and the leather is harder and the car has much more noise (plus only a 3 year warr). My wife has a Saab 93 for $27,000 and don't get me started on the lack of luxury and quality (she loves it though - Saab is unique)There are many idiot. It is the people that think that ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"" is an engineering feat and not a slogan created by an ad agency. The same idiot people who think a Lexus is perfect because of their pursuit of it (perfection). I think value is to take several models within the same category and make them as similar as possible in equipment levels. For instance, the BMW would cost $5,000+/- more at the invoice level for how I bought it. (please do not mention overseas delivery since it is uncommon for the ave buyer)As I said in my earlier post that each one of those qualities are weighted different for every person. You don't value tech toys; thus, it is low. I value it higher because I am in a car often (NAV, Bluetooth, Ventilated Seats). You value driving dynamics and I value them less due to where I live (grid system - no hills) "
"kdshapiro","July 2007"," ""I think that more BMW owners have bought into the brand image/logo more than some other brands.""I agree a lot of people buy a sporty/sports car and yet themselves aren't race car drivers. So who cares about the reason that people buy cars. I wish I was a successful as BMW in brand marketing. People are not as stupid as you think, they are not buying the logo. They are buying what they believe is behind the logo: top quality workmanship, sporty qualities, good ownership experience, etc.No different than someone buying a Lexus because they believe they just picked up the ultimate in luxury.In fact to me BMW has a better type of luxury, less tech toys but a high quality and useful drivers dash. Nav? Ha, 9.99/mo VZ Nav and I can synch it with the website. Bluetooth...already have a hands-free, Ventilated seats..don't like 'em.To each their own. "
"louiswei","July 2007"," kd, you know that you can get an IS without NAV, Bluetooth and Ventilated seats right? Like you said, to each of their own.IMHO, as long as one has a valid reason behind his/her purchasing decision then to me that's more or less a good buy. The reasons that's ""unvalid"" are something like:I buy BMW because it's a BMW, or I buy Lexus because it's a Lexus. "
"blueguydotcom","July 2007","  Yeah the Vz Nav looks like a massive bargain compared to the ridiculously overpriced 2k most manufacturers charge for their systems. "
"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," circle, So true, I have found that the little parts that make up the weakest links are so much cheaper in the IS than the 330. But even more than that is what will the company does when something goes wrong. I know that there are some here who love their IS and that is cool, but for me If I really knew how much Lexus would fight me on every little thing, I would've ponied up on the extra $5k and got the BMW knowing that if there was anything wrong they would be there for me hands down. I know that is contrary to the magazine awards and such but as I said before, those are bought off. This is my experience as an IS owner and a previous 330 owner. Plus I have been in several IS forums in US and Europe and their are a lot more dissatisfied IS customers than some in this forum want to believe.BTW, last night I found a recall on the IS350 brakes because so many people complained abut the exessive dust and the short life. It is a warranty change out to a lower performance system which lasts longer. But I am not street racing my IS, I just got to work and home so I would rather add 2 feet on my stopping distance if it will add $$$ back in my wallet. I am just waiting until they inculde the 250 on the recall. and what you said KD is so true for this forum. ""That is much different than saying buying BMW for the logo. Logo buyers aren't limited to BMW, there are ""L"" logo buyers as well. ""I have found too many ""L"" logo buyers who are trying to convert you becuse they have a one minded view of their relationship with their Lexus. Just like jz said, about the religious thing. There are people who love their car like jz and there are other people here who are in love this their car. I have a different view on the Lexus reliability than jz but that is what makes it a forum. How boring would it be if everyone had the same opinion? I also have always said that I love the IS styling and the start button is awesome. But the reliability of my IS differs from the experience that jz is having with his car.I am just tired of people in these forums trying to tell me that im wrong when I know that I am having a bad experience with Lexus or that I am only one opposite of thousands that love theirs. If I said that Audi is the best in this forum, some would disagree and tell me why they don't feel that way based on their own experiences (and friends experiences), yet others would tell me that I am wrong because THEY KNOW that their brand kicks Audi's A. That is rediculous. This is the religion of Lexus. When I think of the Lexus zealots, I think of those Trans Am and Farrari nut jobs in the 1980's with their logo Members Only jackets.It comes down to the compnay in the end and for me Lexus Corp doesn't measure up. The performance of the 330, or the luxury of the IS, none of it matters if you keep getting screwed over a $10 part that they charge you $1000 for and it breaks every 2 months, then they tell you that it is not under warranty because of some loop hole they created.

It is how they handle it when you buy one is what is important. Will they check it out and replace the part or the whole car, or will they fight you on a $10 part.For me there is never any brand who goes unchecked. If you are a hardcore fan of a brand, then no logic will ever make sense even if God himself comes down to tell you that that brand had one flaw. If BMW started slipping tomorrow, I would drop kick them through the uprights so fast their wheels would spin. Thats what I did to my view of Lexus when they screwed me. and I would do the same with any auto maker. They have to continue to prove themselves everyday. That is what makes a good auto maker. As Robin Williams said in Birdcage, ""You can always get more toast"" If you get 5 lemons, and the compnay is stand up, you will get 5 replacements.

"shipo","July 2007"," Every German car I've ever had was plagued with massive brake dust issues. While I've heard some contradicting explanations why that is, the best one that I've heard so far is that the German version of the DOT (GDOT?) has mandated brake pads with a high graphite content. True? I don't really know.On my E39 I replaced the pads with PBR/Axxis pads after I got tired if cleaning my wheels every couple of hundred miles. With the new pads, I could not feel any difference in braking capabilities, but I did notice a HUGE difference in brake dust, as in NONE.On a separate subject, I watched a bit of the NASCAR race at Indianapolis this weekend (probably the first NASCAR race I've watched since seeing Richard Petty win the Daytona 500 in 1979). I was stunned to see literally CUPS of brake dust spill out of the wheels as they were being removed in the pits during the race. Now THAT'S brake dust.Best Regards,Shipo "

"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," lolIt's actually a pet peeve of mine how often people touch their brakes. I can't comprehend why people always are using their brakes rather than allowing vehicles to naturally slow. I'm not talking about massive engine braking either.

Initially the leading cars pull ahead as they stay at 65-75 until the reach the start of the ramp but I know that slowing from 75-80 I will inevitably still catch up to all the hard-brakers on the ramp. If I'm lucky they've made it to the top and I can hit 50 going 'round the bend and catch them merging. Either way, my brakes don't get touched. "

"habitat1","July 2007"," Lexus is what every manufacturer aspires to be regarding reliability, problems per 100 cars, and long term reliability.Except Porsche.JD PowersHowever, on a purely personal and anecdotal basis, I would concur that Lexus, while at or near the top in quality and reliability, does not appear to have a good reputation with respect to handling problems when they do arise.I was all set to write a check in December 2004 for a GX470. Upon further checking with the several couples we knew that had one, 2 had annoying drivetrain vibrations that, after several attempts, Lexus failed to correct. The dealers and Lexus then went into ""it's normal"" mode, suggesting to one that they ""get over it"". I rode in that car and it shook more than a 30 year old Buick at 65 mph. Ultimately, both of these couples had their cars bought back from Lexus, but it took several months and the filing of lawsuits. During that time, communication with customer service was ""like dealing with the phone company"". When I also checked in Edmunds forums, this GX470 drivetrain vibration problem was fairly common and went on for at least the full 2005 model year. We ended up buying an MDX, so I stopped checking.My only need to voice a complaint with Porsche was when I found out Pirelli had stopped manufacturing the OEM rear tires for my 911. Didn't expect much help, but got a call back the next day from a representative asking me where I wanted two shipped from their own stockpile. The price was less than the Tire Rack price.There is merit in not only looking at what manufacturer has the highest quality and reliability, but also in HOW they handle problems when they arise. "
"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," Good for you. You will be very happy with BMW. I had a 330i and loved it.

"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," I understand your frustration. Yet your anecdote is apparently the exception, not the norm. BMW owners can fill whole books with stories of poor customer management.My engine didn't work correctly on my 03 330i - it stuttered at 4k rpm WOT - yet I've purchased two more BMWs products since. The car's ECU blew at one point and they had the car for 2 weeks. Throughout the ownership experience I had issues with electrical failures too. That's not including the parts broken upon delivery, failed fuses and various other issues with the car.My e90 arrived with a jacked up HVAC system that required many trips to the dealership to resolve. Eventually, BMW had to replace the entire HVAC system in a car that wasn't even 1 year old. Neither of those cars' issues played on my decision to get another BMW product (my Cooper's got its share of problems too but none are worth the hassle of a trip to the dealer). And in the future I'll likely buy BMW again. I really don't see the big deal with what you described above. Certainly nothing that warrants a ""dontbuylexus"" name. "
"shipo","July 2007"," The flip side of course is that my two BMWs were nearly perfect. I say ""nearly perfect"" because my 328i burned out two taillights within a couple of weeks of each other, and my 530i, which was perfect upon delivery in Germany, developed a bizarre drive-by-wire undercompensation-overcompensation-undercompensation problem with the throttle linkage. I complained to my delivery dealership in New Jersey just before moving to New Hampshire and they tried an updated throttle pedal. After moving to New Hampshire I realized that the new pedal just wasn't the issue and took it to my new local dealer. We discussed the issue, and when I informed the tech that my car developed this problem once in the States, he immediately took it in and checked the release date of the firmware. Yup, it was a release that was dated just about when my car hit the port (I assume that the VPC flashed my car with the latest-but-not-the-greatest, thanks). He reflashed it with a subsequently released version of code and ""presto"", my car was perfect again.Best Regards,Shipo "

My engine and electrical issues were NEVER resolved by BMW. They essentially told me I could live with the engine stutter or they could disable the cams so the engine topped out sooner. "
"jzalkin","July 2007"," Let me start my rant by saying I am sorry that you have had a bad experience. Now here is my But,At some point you have to voice your opinion and move on. By constantly attacking one company as all bad and saying that another (BMW in this case) is all good, just makes you look bad. Your brake example is very flawed. Lexus does not have a flaw, but has a product that may have a lot of break dust. My Audi also had a lot of break dust. Lexus owners voiced their opinion and Lexus provides a solution:""Some Lexus vehicles are equipped with high-friction front brake pads, specifically designed for superior braking performance and response. As a result, under certain conditions, it is possible for the customer to experience a larger volume of brake dust on the wheels.For customers who find these characteristics objectionable, an alternative brake pad material has been developed. As with any change made to brake pad material, brakingperformance and feeling may be altered and could possibly be reduced under certain driving conditions as a result of their usage.These alternative front brake pads have now been made available as service parts.""I see this as a positive of a company saying that there is an alternative to the high-performance system if you want it. In your logic, Lexus is bad because they provide a solution to a cosmetic item that many cars share. Others on this board has commented on BMW producing a lot of brake dust.Check out the BMW forums and you will see plenty of people that are just like you saying to run from BMW. Do you think they are right about BMW or are you just selective in your beliefs.I freely admit that Lexus has some bad examples and both Dealers and Corporate have their share of issues. Guess what - so does BMW, Honda, Mercedes, et al.""Lexus is a baby Enron in my opinion.""I hope you know that with comments like this; it ensures that you are not taken seriously. I do need a laugh - please share how Lexus and Enron are similar.You said the internet is the only truth. I would love to compare complaints on Club Lexus vs Bimmer Fest and see if there are more complaints about one brand versus the other. I guess BMW would not fair so well in your method of finding out the truth. Love that cooling system. "
"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," I'm not stating that BMW is free of any mechanical problems. I know that there are cases of people whop have had problems and Lexus people love to drag that one out. But on the most part it is a great car as in the Lexus IS.The key is what will the company do for you when there is a problem. If BMW (dealers and corporate) handled the service and warranty of my Lexus IS250, I would be completely satisfied. They would've checked into the brake issue and pulled it up on the computer, showed it to me and said ""here I see that there is a TSIB on it. would you like to leave it today or make an appiontment for us to change out the brakes for you?"" They would've without question, replaced the rear window when the radio antenna failed (I had to take Lexus to NCDS for that one) and they would charge me a fair price for the service.The same week that I bought a Maxima, I found that it had a crack in the exhaust manifold. They ordered the part, replaced it and paid for my rental without blinking an eye. Lexus (Toyota luxury line) blames my driving on an issue that they have in their computer already, goes to arbitration on a rear window risking a lemon buyback.Lexus Corporation, not the car, is evil, BWM corp is great. the rest is pointless. just like shipo said, he had a major issue with his 328i, but one quick pop into BMW and poof it is gone. that is an honorable company to me. "
"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," First of all why is someone who talks about a bad situation a nut job when more people all over this forum are falling all over themselves to praise Lexus and nobody says a word about how annoying they are.Second, The TSIB is a good thing, but a year later, while Lexus sends those who accept their lies without fixing the problem (lies here beiong that it was my driving and that the window problem was the stationa and or the tint). That is at best neglegence and at worst corporate fraud.Third, if you go to ""my.is"" you will find a heap of postings about how the previous IS owners are underwelmed with 06/07 and that they are sick of fighting Corporate. If you go on a BMW forum and search for corporate problems (not mechanical) you wont find any because no matter how many mechaninical issues there are, BMW always fixes it and definatly never blames their customers.Lastly, Enron and Lexus both cheated and lied for profit, is that simple enough?I find that Lexus zealots, or eny make for that matter, are so blinded that they can't even see that they seem just a crazy as those who oppose Lexus. Maybe even more so because your blind faith is scary. At least I said that I would give BWM the boot if they acted like Lexus. "
"blueguydotcom","July 2007"," he key is what will the company do for you when there is a problem. And as I've pointed out, BMW failed to resolve many of my issues. And plenty of BMW owners can attest to this sort of result. A check in bimmerfest will reveal many 335i owners with sundry unresolved issues - many fuel pump related. They would've checked into the brake issue and pulled it up on the computer, showed it to me and said ""here I see that there is a TSIB on it. would you like to leave it today or make an appiontment for us to change out the brakes for you?"" Not necessarily. Plenty of ZHP owners reported engine problems (dying, stuttering) for years without dealers acknowldege problems, looking for TSBS or in any way offering a resolution.My trips to BMW for engine problems, electrical issues and HVAC equal over 20 in the course of 4 years of ownership. Lexus Corporation, not the car, is evil, BWM corp is great.Rofl. I had a 43k 330i that was marketed and sold as containing a ""performance package"" (ZHP). When BMW's ECUflashes did not resolve the issue with my engine, BMW corporate directed the dealership to disable my car's engine so that the variable valves would always remain in one position - thus no more highend power. Get how that might be frowned upon? I bought the performance package and BMW said they're going to remove the performance as a ""fix.""No company is perfect. Lexus has a far better track record with customer satisfaction than BMW. By a longshot. I will continue to buy BMWs but I don't suffer from the delusion that BMW views me as anything but expendable.And if you can't find people complaining about poor dealer service on a bimmer board, you're not looking very hard.

"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," ok mr. rofl, I am going to use the same arguement that the Lexus zealots say, ""sorry you are having one bad experience but on the most part BMW is a great car and out performs the IS hands down. <----- you see how rediculous some of these coments are that they ignore the real problem and divert the topic.I agree that BMW has had a history of occasional system problems. I also agree that there are BMW dealers out there who suck. The important thing to see is how Lexus Corp is using it's great rep from the 1990's struggling to acheive the BMW status in the public eye, they are using that to now take advantage of thier customers by finding every excuse to save a dollar and over charging. That is corporate greed.So I respect your opinon as that. Mine differs. This is a forum my a pissing match. That is more than I can say for those people who cant stand to read anything bad about their precious car. btw, I have found countless postings on how bad Lexus is, but that doesn't change the fact that they screw me everytime I go in there.

The 335i line is currently plagued with fuel pump, RFT and intercooler issues. You can choose to deny that; just as BMW is currently doing. I'm happy that you believe BMW will stand behind their product and attempt to resolve issues. As you're brand new to the BMW fold, I'd caution against blind devotion though. "
"dontbuylexus","July 2007"," ""As you're brand new to the BMW fold, I'd caution against blind devotion though.""roflI have been a BMW customer before you were in a car seat.

Unlike you, I am not going to stick with a company who keeps screwing me. ""And in the future I'll likely buy BMW again. "" If BMW, according to you is so filled with problems that they dealers and corporate will not fix, then why do you continue to buy them? The answer is that they do fix the problems on a personal level. Anyone who complains that they are not is just not letting them get it through the system (a few months, unlike Lexus took a year and a half for the pads and still no rotors).When I had my BMW I had some issues like shipo had with the computer which needed updating. But when I asked for help they would look into it and then fix it. Lexus tells me that it is me without even taking the car into the service rack. There is a difference between the ability to fix something (reconfigure software updates or develop a new part) to outright doing nothing on principle and then blaming customers who demand more. "

Within my social and business circles I know a large number of people that own Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and all of the other premium brands. I don't know of a single BMW owner that, in order to enjoy the ""driving pleasure"" of BMW, expects that they will need to be without their car an extra 5-10 days a year, let alone 20 or 30. These are law partners, doctors, and corporate execs that don't have the time or tolerance for such B.S. Even those that drive M5's and M3's. Maybe 30 years ago ""driving pleasure"" meant you had to be prepared to go without your car for a month a year. And maybe that's also why Alfa Romeos, Fiats, MGs, and some of those other ""pleasurable"" brands aren't around anymore.But it's 2007. Porsche supplanted Lexus as #1 in the IQS, And my former Honda S2000, arguably about as ""pleasurable"" as you can get for under $40k was also tops in reliability and resale. You can have your cake and eat it too, today. I sincerely hope your experience with your Audi and Mini prove you wrong and you're not without them for 20-30 days annually.

So if they ""made"" you (how can anyone make you is a whole different story) then you would have 3 non run-flats and one run-flat. Now BMW's include run-flats which many a BMW owner has complained about and spent their own money shortly after buying replacing them. If it is true, then the dealership is the worst in the world (possible) or you are stretching the truth in order to bash Lexus even more. PS - My dealership patched my tire after getting a slow leak.

"fedlawman","August 2007"," ""I do care about the 2mm of dishing on my rotors after 20k, then a dealer cost of $600 for new ones.""$600 for Lexus rotors!?!? Thank goodness for the internet, huh?Cars today have more HP and weight than ever before, and brakes have to perform much better than they did just a few years ago. The dishing of the rotor (great photo, by the way) is typical on most European high performance cars - my wife's '04 Volvo station wagon had about that much lip on the rotors at 20k miles (I'm at 50k miles now and still going).It's not a defect or damage - the pads and rotors are engineered to work together to provide both cold initial bite and high temperature fade resistance. A tall order for a 3500 lb luxury/performance car. Dusty pads and softer rotors are what it takes to deliver top of the line performance and safety. Change the formula if you like (EBC and Centric), but only with the understanding that aftermarket suppliers may not know better than the factory engineers what works best on your car in all situations (cold, hot, wet, high speed, down hills, ABS/DSC, etc.). Also, how much R&D did EBC and Centric do with your particular car? With each other? Sure, your brakes will likely perform just fine (you probably won't even detect a difference), but they will no longer perform to ""OE standards."" "

From replaced trannies at 25k miles to bad HVAC to replaced window regulators, the stories of woe with BMW are constant around my office, friendly circles and family gatherings. Everybody I know personally with a BMW - well over 15 people - can point to at least one catastrophic failure of their car while under warranty. One guy's SMG wouldn't go into reverse, my bro-in-law's 3 series' manual went out at 25k miles, another buddy's automatic required a rebuild at 50k miles, another M3 driver had constant issues with his mirrors bubbling and distorting, etc. Constant niggling problems, dealer inefficiency and poor quality control/component engineering are the order of the day with BMW in my experience.

The A3 won out because it offered a compact, fun, powerful, semi-luxurious wagon form (an anomaly in today's world of CUVs/crossovers). Mini got me for the same kinds of reasons - compact, powerful, semi-luxurious and most importantly a hoot to drive (closest thing to it is the GTI and that's all).

"habitat1","August 2007"," Good memory. But actually, it's a 95 Maxima and inasmuch as it's sitting at our second home 375 miles away, it doesn't do much as a back up. I do have a 2004 TL, but I'm considering selling it and bringing back the Maxima.Maybe there's something in the engine oil out there in southern California, but the BMW experiences of my friends and colleagues back east have been pretty good. Maybe not quite up to Lexus in problem infrequency, but comparable or better than Lexus if and when something serious goes wrong. My former boss put 120,000 miles on his 1997 528i and never had a major repair. Retired, moved to Laguna Niguel, bought a new Audi S4 convertible and has had nothing but problems in the first 18 months. I'll admit that although ""driving pleasure"" is very high on my list, I'm not going to turn a complete blind eye to reliability and the potential for costly repairs. I had a chance to ""steal"" a Ferrari 328 at the time I got my S2000 and couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger on a car that runs $2k+ for a tune up and lots more for repairs. As I've said many times, the fact that my 1995 Maxima gave me 155k of trouble free miles contributed to my financial ability (and guilt free conscience) to buy a 911. Also, I always pay cash for my cars and expect to be able to keep them for 100k+ miles, whether I choose to or not.

"dontbuylexus","August 2007"," (you probably won't even detect a difference), but they will no longer perform to ""OE standards.""this is true. so many, and I cant begin to count, want to make it a major performance issue. That would be true if I was racing my IS. but I am going to work and back and the High Friction system might stop faster (no more than 2 feet), but in the real world with consumers, the weakest link by far is the person, between eyes to brain to foot. that could be many car lengths. so to spend $600 (that is for the front system, rotors and pads at the dealer) for 2 feet, is not logical (this is setting the dust asside which can be annoying but not as much as an empty wallet).Also, Lexus did threaten me that not continuing on the $600 every 20k miles by putting aftermarket would not only void the warranty for those parts (understandable to me) but anything associated to them. (unacceptable to me). I took this as them making a case that my rear brakes are now not covered because they are part of the entire braking system which was void by the front non-om parts. "
"jzalkin","August 2007"," This is becoming a back and forth that is not informative nor fun. Considering I point out where Lexus is not as good as others - room, power (IS250), handling - how can I be a zealot or employee.You go way beyond experiences where you state all Lexus cars are bad, unreliable, and that the corporation is defrauding everyone. And yeah, I like to use facts. It is how effective debating is done - using things that can be verified. I also am smart enough to realize one car does not create a trend. Or distort things such as the TSIB to try and make it fit. I guess Apple just admitted they lied since they just released an update to the iphone fixing bugs. Or that Canon lied since they had a firmware update to my Rebel XT after over a year of ownership. I don't ever rebut your experience as being wrong, but I constantly rebut your logic of your experience = everyone's experience. It is the extrapolation of your one issues to the whole that makes no sense. The same as you dismiss the individuals that say the same thing about BMW. Considering I have only owned my Lexus for a little over a year and have owned multiple other brands from Volvo, Audi, Acura, Saab, Honda, and others. I traded my Audi that I loved because of reliability and cost to upkeep on the Lexus and have experienced better fit and finish so far with the Lexus. I drive a lot and need a comfortable, reliable car that also offers some fun. Seems Lexus fits it to a tee, but I miss the convertible and may ultimately end up with another one from another brand. I will wrap it up by putting it this way. I had a Honda Civic in the 1990s that everything kept falling apart on it (bought new). They could never solve about 10% of the issues and they were all minor (no engine failure stuff), but annoyed the (you know what) out of me. I got rid of the car for a Mazda MX-6 V6 (fun car that should have lasted longer in the marketplace) and I still think that I got a bad example from Honda. Facts show Honda makes a reliable car, but mine was the small percentage that was not. I guess I am smart enough to realize that I got the lemon and that someone had to. Did I create a grudge about Honda Corp - Nope. They just stopped receiving my money and I moved on. If Acura makes a more compelling car to my liking, I may even go back. (I did have an early Integra that was great prior to the Honda)I have said my peace and unless compelled will move on and enjoy these forums. PS - Not for this group, but my company builds a lot of labs for Biotechnology and I have been involved in it alot. If you think that big Pharma controls drug discovery than you are misinformed. Look at Scripps Research Institute, Burnham Institute, Torrey Pines not to mention the University Research. Big Pharma actually does the least drug discovery. They just purchase the science and bring it to market with some internal research as well. Talk to any of the scientist researching cures and tell them that they have not made the breakthrough because of Pharma and they will laugh. "

For a so-called luxury auto it generates a great deal of noise on all highways except the smoothest asphalt roads.

When entering a highway it is difficult to get a good view of on coming traffic.Entry to the drivers seat is limited. On my GM sedan the steering wheel tilted at an angle to the steering post allowing easy access. On this car the whole steering post tilts but it has a very narrow range. If you are a little heavy in the thighs ( I don't mean fat ) it is difficult to slide into the seat.The forward cup holder is so deep a small container of coffee gets lost in there and is difficult to get out.I paid 30K and that was 5k too much.

"shipo","August 2007"," I'm currently on a business trip in Michigan and today my client (whose spouse is a GM engineer) says, ""Come on; let's go drive a new CTS."" I agreed and away we went.First off, this car is actually halfway decent looking, and while the family resemblance to the butt ugly first generation CTS is definitely there, it is none-the-less sort of pleasing to look at in an angular sort of way. Then I got in and was surprised to find myself sitting lower than in my old 1985 Dodge Daytona (I was expecting a seating position more in keeping with my 530i), and while the seating position wasn't at all uncomfortable, I just thought it odd given that this car is a mid-sized sedan.The rest of the interior seems to be reasonably well thought out, and once again a vast improvement to the Gen 1 car. All in all, a place where I would generally feel comfortable for a long drive. Then there was the back seat, geez can looks be deceiving or what? Visually it looks large back there, however, upon entering I bashed my head on the steeply raked C pillar, and then landed with a thump down low once again. The problem here is that while the seat cushion in low, the floor isn't. I'm only 5' 8"" and yet with my feet shoved as far forward under the front seat as I could, my thighs were rising from my hips at an angle of greater than twenty degrees. Said another way, my knees were a good eight inches higher than my hips, not a good recipe for a comfortable place to sit on a long drive.Speaking of the drive, the first thing I noticed was that the steering wasn't as heavy as I would have preferred, however, for the general driving public that may not be a bad thing. Personally I prefer the heavy steering of the BMWs; however, I've heard lots of folks complain that many models from BMW and Mercedes-Benz have steering that is too heavy, so for them, the CTS is probably just about perfect.Found a nice country road, pulled away from a stop light and nailed it, holding full throttle through the 1-2 gear change and beyond. Geez was that lame. The software that controls this thing actually backed the throttle off so that the tranny could sort of ooze into second gear. Ewwww. FWIW, I mentioned to the spouse my impressions of the gear change issue and was told later in the day that a software fix was already completed and this car just needed to get patched. Personally I could care less about how the automatic performs as I'd rather have a manual, but come on; our minivans have more positive shifting than this thing. I found myself asking out loud how a transmission like that even saw the light of day.Back to the drive. If that engine has 300 horsepower, then either that car is seriously heavy, or that engine is seriously anemic. My butt-o-meter tells me that the new CTS with a slushbox tranny is probably no faster than say 0-60 in the low sixes. Ride wise, the car was reasonably compliant and seemed to handle well enough, that said, the tires on this thing seemed to be of the relatively narrow all-season variety, so I'm assuming that this wasn't a sport model (if there even is such a thing), and as such cannot judge it too harshly.Long story short, BMW needn't be worried about this car, it seems to be targeted more at the Toyota Avalon / Lexus ES crowd than at the folks who buy 3-Series and 5-Series cars for their driving dynamics.Best Regards,Shipo "
"be325","August 2007"," I asked this question before but it generated no interest.Perhaps this question needs to be placed in another forum .... which?Why the protective modling on the doors is disappearing, especially on luxury cars? Did customer survey revealed that people didn't like them and preferred smal dents and nicks? Or perhaps the strips ruin styling? I wonder why those 'strips' are missing in new BMWs, Acuras.....? "
"habitat1","August 2007"," I think it is strictly a design issue. You can add side moldings to a TL but, IMO they don't look good with the current styling. Same is true of the BMW. There were side moldings on my 1995 Maxima and, for that particular exterior style, they look pretty good. But with the new designs, they wood look a little too much like an aftermarket add on that contrasted with the ""flame"" lines of BMW and creases in the TL.As far as preferring small dents and nicks, I still got a few of them on my Maxima. You need to be pretty lucky to have the offender's door height match your 1"" wide molding. "

Each and every car's moldings are different in height and the out most edge of somebody's door is very likely to not be at that same exact height dimension.These moldings are now called ""protective"" but are nothing more than styling stick-ons.Wanna protect your car from dings...Park on a different planet and walk, like I do, or wrap your car in bubble wrap when you need to leave it in a parking lot. :P "

Not sure where your anti-molding slant comes from, but they do serve a useful purpose. And we park on this planet. "
"goodegg","August 2007"," I gotta say the door edge from our Odyssey lines up perfectly with the MOLDING on the TL when parked in our garage.Funny huh? "
"habitat1","August 2007"," Now there's an even bigger ding in THE MOLDING, and not the door. So, is that supposed to look better? Are you going to have the molding replaced, or just leave it there with the ""bigger ding"". In 3+ years, I've gotten one noticable door ding in my TL and it cost $79 to remove using one of the paintless dent removal services. So far, 0 dings in my 2 year old 911. But when moldings are dinged or scuffed, removing and replacing them can be considerably more expensive. Strictly personal taste, but I think given the nice exterior lines of the TL, the moldings are a detraction. Not so on my 1995 Maxima, but the moldings are scuffed and faded over the years to a slightly different color than the metal. "
"be325","August 2007"," I agree with you goodegg.It is important that the moldings on two cars are aligned but even if they are not, the door of my car or the door of the other car hits my molding not bare metal.

"scottm123","August 2007"," I have a good idea...Let's keep echoing the same point over and over again.This is fun!I have an 06 MDX.Parked next to the 2007 TL Loaner with the side trim pieces, the MDX door hits the TL in a place where the trim does NOTHING to protect it.Yes, if the trim just happens to land in a place where offending door hits, it offers some protection from dings.That is not argued.All I'm saying is that the circumstances have to be just right.I'd rather park in the far corner of a lot and hope for the best than to stick $500- worth of crap plastic on the side of my car. "
"esfoad","August 2007"," I've decided that since the car is replaceable, I will park wherever it's convenient and live with it. For example, you can park as far away as possible and then on the drive home a stone hits and cracks the windshield!

Finally, for those dings that do occur, there are many guys out there who can repair door dings without bodywork. I've had it done and for most dings the results are amazing!I agree that adding strips and cladding that did not come with the vehicle can be tacky (excuse the pun  ). It's hard to do that without hurting the lines and the design of the automobile. "

Again, personal taste and for some, little bit of peace of mind when parking at WalMart .... 600 feet from the entrance. If you are worried about looking cool in your $40k car, you might want to shop somewhere other than WalMart or park even further than 600 feet from the entrance. From what I've seen, 50% of the vehicles in the lots are pick-ups and most of the rest of the cars look like they've been to hell and back. Not exactly the best place to keep your car from getting dinged, moldings or not. "

Was replacing my 2002 Acura TL which had been a trusty and loyal steed. Drove all the cars discussed here and then some. Chicago, so it had to be front or all wheel drive and I'm sick of front wheel drive, so that ruled out Acura again. Would have gotten the G35, but I just couldn't pull the trigger on the one car on the market that doesn't make even the tiniest effort towards green efficiency. Everything about that car is engineered to go fast and nothing else. Other than that, I think it's the best ellps out there. Everything else was too small (I tend to put a coupla shorties in the back seat about twice a week) except maybe the A4, which I liked but it's dated and I didn't want to wait for the new one so that left me one option; a pre-owned luxury performace sedan. Got a great deal on an 2006 Audi A6, low miles, loaded s-line for $38.5k. I'm so happy with it that I'm retiring from car shopping for a while. Good luck and have fun. "

"shipo","August 2007"," Basically I meant that any late model RWD car (i.e. equipped with traction control) that isn't shod with summer rubber should be more than capable of handling Chicagoland roads in winter weather. The fact is that Chicago and its surrounding areas are faaa-lat, and don't need the extra traction afforded by AWD or even winter tires for that matter. That said, if I was to move back to Chicago and have a RWD car, I'd most certainly buy a set of winter rubber for it.Best Regards,Shipo "

Steering is also on the light side, which makes it drives more like a Japanese midsizer than an entry luxury sedan. The power is adequate enough I guess but low end torque could use a lot of improvement. Audi could learn from BMW about how to reduce turbo lag. Generally speaking the driving dynamic is not what I expected from a German car, even in a FWD. I also don't see any of the ""legendary Audi interior"" in the A4. Material used although is not cheap but not among the leaders in its segment. MB, BMW and Lexus all utilized better materials in their own entry luxury sedans. However, the fit-and-finish is definitely among one of the best though. I believe the one I got has fake leather seats, they don't feel good when touched but is supportive and comfortable during long trips.I guess next time I'll test drive an A4 Quattro just to see if the experience will be different.

New one is alright, just a little more bubbleous our the sides, a little more rake to the roofline, and lots of stuff going on up front. Looks like the photos. I guess it is suppose to look more macho, or whatever. It is parked next to a stretch version of same called the STS '08. I would say the best look by far is the old CTS of the three, IMHO. The interior looked way finer in quality, from what I could see, as they had the doors locked. The exterior is silver, and a bit dull. I would think a red may look more sporty, or a black one more sexy. The front is a bit much. To me the roof-line, front and rear deck look somehow less in per portion to the overall shape than it did before. You know that feeling like something is just not flowing right. Maybe take away the back doors, which are shorter, and make it a coupe would work better? And like I said, maybe in red or some other color it is more exciting.

"vic10","September 2007"," Well, the Edsel was polarizing...but that wasn't necessarily a good thing....The last Caddy I liked was the 1999. Still carried remnants of the ""classic"" Caddy look. The mushy looking 2000 was just soooo boring. There were hopes when the edge look was to come out but somehow the look was also boring, and didn't look very integrated (the 300C also has the slab sided edgy look but it comes off better...much better I think). I walk past a 2007 STS in the parking lot every morning and it's about as exciting looking as a Checker cab. Finally got to the point where I could easily afford one and suddenly found I didn't want one. Having said that, I think the CTS (and not the STS)really benefited from the 2008 restyle. Much more interesting exterior. Really like the agressive front end. And the interior looks much more refined--though I have one issue, aside from that hugh looking steering wheel: The dual climate controls on either side of the console. So if you're solo in the car and want to change setting you have to lean around to get both sides working in parallel?? "

"plekto","September 2007"," The steering wheel comes in three trims. One is some sort of rubberized nonsense, then there is leather. Evidently they did the foam/rubbery thing to match the leather one in size.(some of the leather interior ones don't have a leather wrapped wheel, so they look like they cheated a bit)There's also a thinner one on the base model. I think it looks best.Pros: Much better car in every way inside and underneath.Cons: Sheet metal on it is hideous in person compared to the older one's exterior. Only black or a very dark color serves to make it look smaller and hide the myriad of hideous angles.(looks very sharp in black, btw). The sunroof is also a joke - it's huge but still so far back that the driver can't see OUT of it. It just creates a massive lens as it's slightly curved in the wrong direction/way. The interior really feels awful in the summer heat with that thing beating heat down on the back of your neck(right at the driver's hearrest seems to eb the focal point)The flat aluminum rims look better than the chromed as well.

We are talking about a Cadillac, which last I checked is a luxury brand, here right?I seriously doubt that this is true but if it is then Cadillac is just being the Cadillac of the old. Which is bad... "
"plekto","September 2007"," There was a small bit of print in the corner of the sticker:""This model was made without wood trim on the steering wheel"" - Since it didn't have leather, either, it was some sort of other material. I think it's an early supply problem or something. The wood one has a thinner diamater. But the wheel isn't large by any means - just about right.Oh - the thing about the leg room... That's the underside of the dash. Most cars have a very angled area that you hit your knees before you're totally out of space. The CTS - they made it very curved and shallow so there's a lot of legroom. (ie - dash is less of a bloated mess and a tiny bit slimmer.)Seats are lovely. I'm 5'8"" and no problems. I'm used to big Euro style headrests, so zero complaints. love the stitching. Almost every surface that you touch has some sort of material other than hard plastic(the window sills being my favorite - actual softness for once). Ford could learn a lot from this. Shoot, Toyota and Honda as well - the interior makes an Accord look like a rental car, to be honest. GM's done a top-notch effort that is equal to VW/Audi(yes, amazing - let's hope this isn't a singular occurance)Drives nicely. IMO, I liked the regular non DI better. Why? The DI feels typical top-end powerish like everyone else. The regular seems a bit better balanced between HP and Torque at low rpms. And it's cheaper. AND I don't have to get leather and all the other crud to get manual.Oh - I sat in one without the sunroof as I mentioned. Very nice - makes the car feel a LOT less squashed inside. Love the radio controls as well. Nice big, fat, ANALOG dials. (it's been shown that people spend about alf the time and brainpower dealing with dials compared to switches for tasks that aren't on/off decisions) Clock in the center is also keeping with the same theme. Digital is SO 1980s.Lovely back seats. Cudos to GM for giving the rear seatbacks storage and the rear seats their own A/C vent.Minor gripes:- Wierd glovebox design. Oh well.- Trunk needs more storage areas at the sides. - First thing I'd do if I got it home would be to remove all of the useless engine plastic. I hate that don't look at it nonsense. Show me metal and bits under the hood. Easy to fix, though. - Traction control switch needs to NOT be buried in the dash with all of the other buttons.- flat aluminum or stainless steelwhat a concept!) would be better than the blingy chrome. Or anodized black like on Benzes?- needs dark anodized rims as an option for the darker colors.(CTS ""Night Edition"" or something)- Rear seat cupholder/armrest needs work - doesn't fit the rest of the interior's look- Why can't we get a split/fold seat without buying leather?Overall, I rate the car as 90% perfect/8% good or needs a bit of work. 1-2% not right(mostly the chrome on the exterior) It's not a ""dear lord"" you get when looking at a S500, but it's a mile away from the Lexus blandness or the joke Ford is doing.

I will concede that is much better than average for GM, but I still think it's a couple of rungs down from the Japanese and German competitors.What would that 2004 CTS 3.6L cost new? According to Edmunds, there are a lot of options that NADA appears to assume you have (luxury package, etc) in their resale figures. My guess is that an optioned 2004 CTS had an MSRP of $36-37k?I bought a 2004 Acura TL w/ Navigation for $32k and everything was standard for that price. (I think MSRP was around $33.6k) Assuming 50,000 miles, it's NADA ""clean trade in value"" is $21,975, about $2,700 more than a CTS. If that CTS started with a $3,000+/- higher initial price, that's a significant ($5,700) depreciation difference over three years.The 2004 330i that I considered had an MSRP of $38,500 and now has an NADA clean trade in value of $25,250.

I couldn't get NADA to show a 2004 BMW 330i with a trade-in higher than $25,225 - and that was a 330i with Auto, Nav, SP, PP, and HK. This 330i new would have had an MSRP of approx $41,400 (34,600 base, plus Auto 1500, Nav 1800, SP 1600, PP 1200, HK 700). That's 61% of it's original value.NADA value for a fully equipped 2004 CTS 3.6 is $20,700. Assuming a $36,000 MSRP you get 57.5% of original value.We can crunch numbers all day with different options but the results are basically going to be the same.

"renssils","September 2007"," Having rented recently, each for a week, an Infiniti M35 and an Audi A6 3.2, I looked forwarded to trying out the 2008 Cadillac CTS, in which I sat this morning. Audi, Infiniti, Lexus and others need not worry about this would-be competitor. If anything, the CTS seems to a competitor for the Audi A4, BMW 3, Infiniti G35, Volvo S60 and other similarly priced cars. The CTS lacks so many features and benefits of the A6 and M35, none of which are absolutely needed, but do make driving more enjoyable for customers willing to spend $45,000 to $50,000 or more. In addition, I thought that the fit and finish wasn't as well done as the Audi and the Infiniti. The CTS's trunk is fully lined, but looks cheap. The $41,000 CTS had no back-sensors, no Bluetooth, no motorized steering column, a claustrophobic rear passenger area, no B-pillar vents, and an intrusive sunroof. A fully optioned CTS at a list price of $49,000 is overpriced, I think. I'd rather buy the Audi or the Infiniti and, in fact, I think that I will. "

This perception that because it's less expensive than the competition it must be placed with the other makers budget cars seems to still be alive.GM itself says that the car isn't ""entry level"" - they just don't sell their entry-level BTS here in the U.S. because it would fail.(actually it's not doing well in Europe, either). The CTS is their second from the bottom Cadillac, nonetheless, and is marketed towards the middle range import.(A6, G35, etc). Whether GM can manage to pull off what Hyundai seems to be doing to the Japanese makers remains to be seen.In fact, the recent announcement about a smaller entry-level car(which won't sell) is probably their bringing the BTS over to kill this wrong image. Even if they don't sell more than a thousand a year, it will push the CTS up a notch in the reviews, where it competes better. It's NO 3 series - it's way too large to compete handling wise.

The 2007?The commercials barely started coming out last week.The car has always been slotted between the 3-Series and the 5-Series with the main advantage being interior room--not amenities.They always had the STS for that.Even the magazines grouped the old car there when reviewing it. All of them.You cannot find a car like the CTS with all its dimensions etc., for the same price. No other exists (another story altogether). "
"texases","September 2007"," Yes, it's not hard to find a CTS listing at $40k or less, not optioned out, but way less than any A6 or 5er. Of course a $55k car will (and should) behave better. "

Not a Maybach, but not bad - and a lot better than trying to cram in the back seat of, say, a C class.The handling is softer than a 3. Yeah, so what. It's NOT a small car.

I guess they are consistent, if nothing else. A particularly sad commentary that you and others that buy GM's think you need a ""floaty"" Buick-like ride to deal with U.S. roads. Perhaps that's the best GM engineers can muster, but there are plenty of cars out there that give you tight handling and good driving dynamics without loosening your fillings. Like the 3-series or my TL 6-speed. Even my 911, with its adjustable suspension and 19"" wheels is fine around DC (not just my opinion, but my wife's and 2 daughters that fit in the back) A 3-series too ""agressive""? Pitiful comment - and I don't mean about the car. IMO, GM does a fine act of trying to better the E class(which appears to be one of the cars they tried to beat/compete against).Are you nuts? Return to Earth. The CTS isn't in the same solar system as the E-class. In case you haven't noticed, the E class has a real back seat good for 2 full size adults or 3 kids. It has very good handling (i.e. too ""agressive""). It's a real luxury sedan, NOT an entry level luxury performance sedan. Many/most here seem to think the CTS pulls up the rear of the ELLPS cars listed above. Some don't even think it competes, period. So nice try, but comparing a CTS to an E class (or 5 series) is like me coming in last in my weekend golfing foursome, and then telling my wife I'm ready to sign up for the Tour and take on Tiger Woods.It appears that you are the pilot of the intersteller ship here.

"plekto","September 2007"," Wow. There's just no way to make people here happy. I guess it's expected, this being an online forum. Gripe forever about the old model and then the new one... gosh, it's Gripe some more about minor things.Doesn't have bluetooth? Let's bring it in an get the demons exorcised. The sunshade isn't opaque enough? The fact that it's exactly like half a dozen other makers panoramic sunroofs is immaterial. Let's bring it in and try it as a heretic. (btw - buy a Mercedes and there IS no shade at all - just acres of glass. You want that, roll the shade all the way open!)The suspension isn't better than a car costing $10-15K more? Time to burn it at the stake, because it's a lost cause. I get the distinct feeling that nothing would satisfy you short of it being a 3 series. Oh wait, if it was a clone of the 3 series, you'd probably deride it for being a copycat. It's like having an interactive version of a Motor Trend or Consumer Reports article. GM=bad, Imports=good. ***I've driven it. Also the E class. I'll tell you, the bling in the newer plasti-Cedes is paper thin, just like the rest. The reliability is a joke, and it drives very poorly. Honestly I'd rather own a Lucerne CXS or a Lexus GS than a new E. The new 3? A nice car I guess, but it weighs the same as my father's 1997 Park Ave Ultra. Serious mind-boggling bloat. And a price-tag to buy(not to mention repairs if you're stupid enough to NOT lease) that makes your accountant want to sign you up for therapy. After they hit you upside your head.My point is that none of these cars are perfect by a long shot. But it's clear to me that GM is trying to do what Hyundai did a decade ago and move towards a new goal/market segment.  Cadillac announcing that they will re-do their entire line with the CTS as the 2nd out of four offerings is exactly right, IMO. The CTS will occupy that midsize luxury/sporty segment quite nicely. And every maker has a different idea of what that segment is. For $35K, you can't make an S Class, after all. Compromises have to be made.About the rear seats...The rear seats that are a bit too upright(the problem appears to only happen on the split/fold seats - too far forward/not deep enough cushions), so it feels tighter. Leg and arm space is far better than the 3 series(though it's not the lazy-boy reclining effect you get in the Lexus models now), even though it doesn't FEEL like it due to the geometry. But there is a trick as well(of sorts). GM's seats get seriously soft and mushy over time. 4-5 years later, the rear seats will have softened more than enough to make the rear seat gain back that 2 inches of room. I think they probably designed them for once to take that into account and people aren't used to it. Oh, you'll note that the trunk is MUCH larger than a typical small car? Right - that's where a couple of inches on the interior went. But if the trunk was 3 series sized, you'd of course jump all over it. It amazes me that people are so auto reviewer jaded today that well, if the seats aren't like a sofa, well, it's a cramped disaster - toss the ashes down a mineshaft, because it's unacceptable. There seems to be ZERO tolerange for anything inbetween here. Either it's perfect or it's worthless. "

"shipo","September 2007"," Unfortunately this particular discussion has, for years, exhibited the least amount of decorum of any that I frequent (I've even boycotted it for months on end as a result). Some folks are determined to convince the world that GM makes the best ELLPS in the world, other folks are just as determined that distinction should fall to Lexus or Infiniti or Audi or Mercedes-Benz. Needless to say, there are also many who hold with BMW.The above in and of itself isn't the problem. If you ever decide to take the time to review all ten thousand posts you'll see a common theme.1) A new car (or new generation of an existing model) is announced and often heralded (by the manufacturer, the press and/or the members of the TownHall) as being the ultimate BMW killer (an attribute ascribed in turn to the two generations each of the Infiniti G, the Lexus IS and of course the Cadillac CTS).2) The BMW folks say ""Uhhh, sorry, try again.""3) Things degrade from there.My personal belief is that if folks would simply lose their personal biases (Who me? Biased?) and discuss the attributes of the various ELLPSs that are important to them and why they prefer one car over another (after having driven them of course), all would be well. Unfortunately many folks simply look at a spec sheet and proclaim their favorites without ever even seeing the car in the flesh. Not to pick on rockylee (he hasn't posted here in quite some time), but well over a year ago he was proudly proclaiming that all other makers of ELLPSs should in essence pack up their cars and go home because the Gen 2 CTS was going to take over the world and destroy the sales of all of the other manufacturers.There is only one thing I can guarantee about rhetoric like that; it will start a cat fight that will spiral down, completely out of control. Then Pat will step in, shut this discussion down for a week or two to let the combatants cool down, and then it will gradually start all over again. Annoying, but there it is.Best Regards,Shipo "

The car doesn't appeal to me for a number of reasons (size, weight, bling factor), but I respect that it doesn't try to beat BMW at their own game. I believe that it most certainly competes with BMW and Infiniti, and that it most certainly belongs in this discussion.GM has gone in another direction to appeal to who they think is shopping this segment, and frankly, I think they're on to something.While the Europeans and Japanese are grudgingly making their entry-lux sedans more luxurious and upscale for North America - at the expense of sporty performance - Cadillac just says ""to hell with it"" and gives North America what we refuse to admit we really want.Like it or not, Americans have been are speaking with their wallets, and for the last few years, we have been saying we want $300+ hp, chrome, wood, bluetooth, and auto parallel-parking leviathans.

"circlew","September 2007"," Good points, but here is a good snip-it that hits home for the CTS in my view:(March 2007)Since The General has been unable to build small cars profitably since, um, ever, the company also knew that the Cadillac brand represented a mission-critical large passenger car profit center. So GM dedicated their new high-end Sigma rear wheel-drive platform exclusively to a line of premium sedans (CTS, STS) and a crossover (SRX). With lots of bragging about N?rburgring chassis fettling, the BMW 3-Series fighter CTS was the first out of the box.The press gave the CTS rave reviews. After a sluggish start, sales peaked in 2005 at 61k units. Sales in &#146;06 are off 11 percent. Year-to-date (YTD) &#146;07 they&#146;re down 27 percent. Anticipation of the redesigned &#146;08 CTS is keeping some intenders&#146; powder dry, but it&#146;s clear the model still hasn&#146;t found its happy place.I really do not think this model will prevail in the market but we will see. I particularly do not like the styling and judging from the age demographics that the Top GM brand has claimed over the years, IMO, sales will continue to slide to the competition.In other words, does ANYONE really think this model will devlop into a top sales leader in this category?? I can't help thinking: Catera...Regards,OW "

"plekto","September 2007"," Okay, I went to the dealer again this morning. I looked at a CTS with the performance package and nothing else. I sat in it for 10 minutes and carefully thought things out.1:The sunroof DOES take up three inches of headroom in the front and two in the rear. Without it, it's a very nice car. Feels very spacious, yet narrow. The exact same feeling Volvo had a decade ago in its 850. Very nice, actually - a large 2+2 seating arrangement. Halfway between the 3 and 5, which seems to be a good place.2:The seats. They were the non-fold down type. I sat in it and thought for a while. I realized that the car was perfect for someone in less than 5'10"". The cramped feeling was an illusion.The problem is the rear pillars. They curve inward an inch or two because of the rear seat side airbags(which most cars don't have, allowing for straight pillars). In addition, the rear door sils are very high, so you feel like you are sitting down in the rear. But it's an illusion. The car actually is identical to the other smaller cars in the rear. It fits two normal adults nicely enough. IMO, Cadillac should have made the door sils 2 inches lower to solve this, but it's probably govt crash regulations that are feeding this tall door/small window insanity. "

The Corvette is one of the least likely cars to ever make it into my garage, over a 911 or 430. But I respect that, for what it does, it is a very competent car.

"markcincinnati","September 2007"," I do like the CTS, I will certainly consider one in early 2008, assuming they (GM) offer discounts and subvented leases as they have done time and again.At the MSRP ""as I would configure"" the CTS, it is a fine car but -- other than fit and finish and its styling -- it ""seems to be as current as many of the other guys were putting out in the second half of 2004.""For a typical second or third quarter GM discount, however, it will be attractive even to someone like me who thinks it is not exactly leading edge (although the DI engine seems very fine, indeed.)On the issue of voice activation -- I have a current gen Audi A6. It has 82 buttons, knobs, switches, dials, gauges and/or controls (not including my phone.) I have the in-armrest mounted phone dock AND the thing has bluetooth. I rarely, due to the the in armrest cradle, activate bluetooth -- but I use the voice control for the audio, nav and telephone system -- almost literally every time I get into the car.I consider it a safety feature.Were a vote be presented to the voters of the US, I would, uncharacteristically, vote to ban the use of a cell phone in a car that was not entirely voice controlled (hand and eyes free.)When I am driving, I often look at the other drivers on the road; I see the majority of them on the phone (driving with one hand and I assume one eye on the road and controls.)Much as I want ""you"" to have the personal freedom to kill yourself by using a phone while driving (if that is your goal), I just don't want to be on the highway with you.Much as I want (well, maybe) more knobs and buttons and dials and gizmos to be confronting me whilst I am behind the wheel, it is getting to the point that it is distracting to change the channel (and find other controls in the sea of buttons) without voice command.My wife's 2005 BMW does not need voice command. The new CTS is populated with buttons, dials, rotary switches -- a virtual maze of controls. Just tell your car what you want it to do, or ""pull over"" -- folks don't want to pull over and voice command is becoming (or in the case of the Germans, already has become) a virtual safety option.At age 56, I may be a yuppie.

"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," Agreed. This forum is supposed to be about things that most of us enjoy as a passtime, or certainly a drivetime. Manufacturers compete for our dollars fiercely in this space and like most things concerning marketing, most of us are conditioned to preferences after a while, even decending into ""fanboyism"". I admit it, I have preferences with certain brands over others. But I want all of them to deliver the best product possible since it's impossible for the products from one brand to satisfy everyone. After all, if everyone just bought ""your favorite brand"", it would be a pretty boring place.Regarding the two brands at issue here, Cadillac has been going down this ""Europeanism"" trend for a long time before the CTS, often with lousy results. I can remember the 1976 Seville, the 1982 Cimarron, the 1989 Allante and the 1997 Catera as examples. Cadillac has had the unenvyable position of trying to rewrite their DNA for decades now, which isn't easy. Even with Bob Lutz at the helm, a former GM engine manager once told me that GM's corporate culture doesn't do much to reward risk...in fact, the company (and especially Cadillac) got very risk averse over the last 30 years. Witness the 1981 V8-6-4 engine failure, the 1982 Cimarron, the 1989 Allante and Catera projects all made Caddy very adverse making the product decisions they need to make.Constrast that with BMW. The BMW we all know really got off the ground in the early '70s with the first 2002s. Originally in the shadow of Mercedes and Audi, they made their mark with great handling sedans and coupes that were contrary to what most American buyers were used to seeing. Were all these products successful? Not a chance. The 320 program of the early '80s (especially the 320e) weren't home run hits. The 12-cylinder 850s lanquished on dealer lots and recent models were fiercely criticized for Bangle styling and iDrive. But the path to where BMW is now has been fairly straightforward to the point where they command many of the segments they compete in.In business, it's interesting to watch the players that do most everything right but its far more fun and educational to see the ones that were once powerful fall from grace and claw themselves back to relevance. Apple Computer is a classic example. Cadillac is trying to do the same thing (against bigger odds in my opinion). What happens next? Who knows? But the marketplace will decide. "

And I will admit I always considered the E36/46 were to small for my tastes predominantly because I was used to U.S. market fare. I believed the Buy America was the way to go until it made little sense at the end of the day. I was surprised at the weight of my 330 considering the compact designation, however. I guess BMW compromised from the original design strategy. But the suspension still is to die for. I could care less for the perceived image factor. You could slice off the roundel and it would still be in my garage.I agree it is fun to see what the ""Hurtin' Three"" will do to put the train back on the tracks. The Camaro and Challenger coming back from the dead will be interesting. For GM, Cadillac needs a heck of a lot more work to do. Buick/Pontiac is on life support and the prognosis is NOT good.

GM responded by saying, ""if you keep doing this, we'll have to shut the plant down here in Norwood.""Then ""all of a sudden"" GM says, ""we can't make a go of it here anymore"" -- and ""all of a sudden"" the union, in response, threatened productivity.Too little, too late.This account is a summary, is incomplete and is somewhat light on the facts, since it was certainly NOT solely the union that killed GM here in Cincinnati (Hamilton, Oh and Norwood, Oh.)The point is, with over $1,500 in ""burden"" per car produced, we should not be surprised to see cars made by companies that have a ""comparative advantage.""

The vast majority of these assembly line and plant jobs do not require a college education and are nominally more ""skilled"" than the average service worker. It's nice to think that somebody with a high school education can punch a clock for 40 hours per week, have 4-5 weeks of vacation a year, and make the equivalent of $120-150,000+ per year ($60k-$80k more than their Toyota counterparts).

Flipside, longshoremen and autoworkers are employed in what are traditionally considered blue collar jobs: little specific education to carry out the tasks and those tasks have become highly automated.

"plekto","September 2007"," The problem is that the UAW's ""Job Security"" essentially ties GM's hands. They want to get rid of the entire Job Bank and many part-timers to lower costs, but the union won't budge.Unfortunately, for GM, it's trim the workforce or shut its doors in the U.S. and move overseas. Zero other options. So the UAW just effectively shot itself in the foot because GM is back against a wall with no way out.(and logically, as a result, no room to negotiate). They sucked and sucked and sucked at that teat until it just gave out.GM's best move at this point? Fire the entire UAW and hire the employees on their own terms(or hire new workers). They really have no other choice. Given how our economy is going downhill, I suspect most of the workers will give in sooner or later if it's a choice between accepting less money and having their car and house payments or having their pride. The rest they can hire.Now, I'm personally a supporter of MOST unions, but it's a give and take scenario. I've seen the UAW do noting but take for two decades or more and it's finally made GM decide that opting out is less painful than negotiating. I don't really blame them, either. "

Oh sure Cadillac wouldn't mind some 3-seried buyers cross shopping since they don't have a car in that space (in America) and probably won't for another 2 years.

But Cadillac has already publically stated that the STS (and DTS) will die in favor of a new large flagship car, while a smaller ""B-series"" car will slot under the CTS in the next couple of years.Yes the CTS is on the heavy side and that's been a problem for GM's Sigma platform in general.

I fully expect GM to retify that situation when the next-gen Northstar appears in a year or two. With a new CTS-V also due on the horizon, that means the STS can be put out to pasture.

Seriously you just went on and on about epa space and then come back by saying it's not important to you. So what is important? If space isn't an issue, then why opt for a car of that size?When did I ever say that EPA space wasn't important to me? Please reread my post. I only used it to show the differentiation in the sizes of the vehicles. Everybody says the CTS is either better suited to compete against the BMW 3-series or is more of a ""tweener"" car in size. The measurements of this car say otherwise. You could successfully make that argument about the older car, but not this one.Huh? 5 series and 3 series both have 3.0 300 hp engines compared to the Caddy's 300 hp V6. Strangely, that 300 hp 6 in the 5 and 3 propels both cars with electrifying power. What exactly is wrong with GM's engine development? The weight can't be totally to blame for the slowness of the CTS.What I meant here was that virtually all the cars in this class (save Acura) offer both a V6 engine (sometimes two) and a V8 before getting to the ""hot-rod"" department. BMW has the 540i, Mercedes has the E550, and so on and so forth. Also, weight is a big factor in the performance of a vehicle but it's not the only factor. Available torque and where that torque is available on the RPM curve is very important. The CTS DI V6 has less torque than the 535i, and the CTS weighs more than the 535i. So noticing that the CTS is slower than the BMW isn't rocket science. Finally, gear ratios (transmission and final drive) are the third variable in the equation, but that's another discussion. "

The chassis is an update to the same Sigma chassis found in the old CTS, the STS and the SRX. That chassis is known for its strength and all around performance, but it's not the lightest design out there.

"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," Hi Mark,I can agree on some of your points and disagree on others. First, I do think the CTS is a member of the 5 series competitor club with the exception of the non-availability of V8 power. It has just about everything else. There are a few options sometimes found in this group (lane change avoidance) that are still only available on the STS, probably to keep some product seperation while that model goes on its long march to oblivion.And regarding Infiniti, ah yes, they do upset the ol' product line apple cart, don't they? The M35 is on the large size of the class, mostly in terms of length (one of the reasons I liked it...it's always been on my short list). The G35 is supposed to be the BMW 3 series competitor, but in terms of size, it's the ""tweener car"" that the old CTS was. The G35 is a small midsize car that's on the small size of the 5-series class in terms of length and about and inch and change shorter in wheelbase. The width is narrower, much like the old CTS. As a result, it's playing in that ""I can be a 3 series competitor and give you more room"" role that the old CTS was doing. As a result, it's simular engine power but smaller mass gives it a small advantage to the new CTS but still nips the heels of the smaller BMW.Given your previous posts, I know AWD is a bigger priority for you up in Ohio versus for me down in Tennessee. And that's fine by me. The G35 AWD will probably pull a more sporting performance that the CTS AWD given a likely 400-500 lb weight advantage. The CTS gives the driver more interior room (especially leg room) which is a bigger priority for me (top priority really). "

"markcincinnati","September 2007"," I have found faults with the new CTS. For the most part, these faults would not rule the new CTS out. The thing is, to my eye, beautiful and seemingly well made (fit and finish wise, at least.)I think it is an STS killer and if that does come true, it will probably enter the LPS class. It is, at this moment in time, still a ""near"" LPS contestant. NOT because I say so, heck it is virtually in the class now by most ""measurable"" accounts (content wise.)It is not the most modern, it breaks very little new ground (if any) in the ELLPS or LPS class -- other than its styling. When compared with the LPS class it comes out as a bargain, when compared with the class ""the pundits"" place it in, however, it is about 15% or so too pricey.I do not think it is Cadillac's Phaeton -- indeed, I think it will be thought of as the beginning of a new Cadillac. It will find itself -- if it is forced to play in the LPS class -- the bargain car.That may not be enough.I would compare the new CTS with the BMW 3, the NEW (not in the US yet) A4 and perhaps an Infiniti or Lexus of the tweener variety as you suggest.Now, for me, the interior and the 300+ HP motor are winners -- and knowing GM, the lease incentives will start second quarter '08 and make the new CTS hard to resist for many of us who have ""been there done that"" with similar sized cars from Europe.

"david_fl","October 2007"," I disagree with your comment about not being able to touch that deal. I just leased a G35 sedan last week for $1600 down and $440 a month for 39 mnth/15k yr. I know if I dropped my mileage to 12k a year my price would have dropped a bunch as well, so it would be even closer to the Audi deal. I was also looking at the A4 and choose to pay a bit more for the G35. Here are some of the reasons I made that decisions simple just based on my opinions and time spent in the cars during the ""fun"" process they call car buying.The G35 just started its current model, while next year at this time everybody will be talking about he new A4 model and I did not want to be tied into an old model. I felt like I was getting more standard features with the G35 vs. the A4 (one of the real breaking points was the fact Audi simple could not offer me memory seating)The engine simple blew the Audi out of the water. Low 200's vs. low 300's, come on... not even close!I like the looks of the G35 body better than the A4. I do think the A4 with the S line exterior looks very sharp and sporty (which is standard on the 08'), I just thought it looked a bit dated, like I have seen that body style for a long time now One nifty little feature that I first thought was gimmicky is the keyless entry and engine start. I do have to say I love not needing to pull my keys out, not sure if the ""fun factor"" will wear off on that :shades: Audi did have some points that I thought were better than Infiniti thoughThe A4 has WAYYYYY better gas mileage than G35I liked the fact the A4 had a CVT transmission, I felt it was smooth and more predicable.I like the interior of the A4 a bit more than the G35. I thought the A4 was ""classier"" and had more of a premium look and feel, while I do think the G35 is nice I jest felt like it was colder and not as upscale compared with the A4All in all I would really suggest you look at what you really want and if paying a few extra $$$ is worth it in the long haul. I simply said ""it is only $40 bucks a month, I can bring my lunch for a few days to work.""Of course I went with an 07' G35 as an 08' simple did not justify the increased cost for the few extras is brought, a different story if going to actually purchase.The Lexus is a nice car, but personally I think it looks a little weird and the seats were kind of small (front and back) and the lease rates where just not close to the A4 or G35.

I see no advantage to fishing a key from my pocket, fumbling for the lock and then having to put the key in the ignition. Like I said, once you live with it...it's hard to go back. I loved walking up to my BMW, getting right in and pressing go. All the old steps were gone. It just made getting my favorite part - driving - so much easier. Carrying groceries...boom right into the trunk, no stopping. Leaving the car - off, pull the e-brake, hop out and walk away. Can't be much cleaner than that. "
"leadfoot4","October 2007"," Hey all! I'm lookng for a little quick advice and or opinions. My wife's aunt has an '01 325xi with roughly 30,000 miles. She took it in to the dealer yesterday to get it's annual state safety inspection. Instead, she got the shock of her life...they told her that $1100 in repairs were necessary.First off, they said the rear brakes were totally shot. I'm assuming the e-brake mechanism probably froze up due to road salt corosion. That, in turn, probably toasted the pads and then the rotors. Not happy, but probably logical, however $500 seems a bit high to buy 2 calipers, rotors, and pads, as well as replace the parts.The second item on the list really got me, though...BOTH rear springs were broken...On a 30,000 mile car, that never has even seen anybody in the back seat! Another $500-550 to replace them. I'm not all that familiar with BMWs, does this seem normal??Thanks for any info you can provide! "
"louiswei","October 2007"," Can't agree with you more...Before I have a smart key car I don't think this is a big deal too. I was like: how tough can it be to take the key out of my pocket, put it in the ignition and twist it? But after getting used to it I was so uncomfortable with a non-smart key car.It's just one of those things that you really don't need it but once you get used to it, you can hardly go back. It's like drugs...I can't see myself owning another car without this feature. "
"blueguydotcom","October 2007"," Broken springs and bad brakes = tough or bad driving conditions. You mentioned road salt, so I presume she drives in an area with really bad roads - potholes, broken asphalt, etc? It's quite possible she did these things and as it typical of many people, simply won't cop to it or ""forgot"" about that or those incidents where she really slammed the car. Obviously, going to an independent repair shop is a much better idea (and you'll save probably 30-40%). The BMW is way out of warranty, so why in the hell are you taking the car to a stealership. Dealerships make the majority of their money on two things: used cars and repairs. Selling new cars to you only starts the cycle... "
"habitat1","October 2007"," It's all relative. 90%+ of drivers see no advantage to ""fumbling"" with a manual transmission, let alone their ignition key.

Personally, given the enhanced ability to venture ""off course"" and detour my way around traffic jambs, I won't own another car without a navigation system.I'm sure I'd find the keyless entry feature convenient, myself. But I also forgot to mention that my 911 was in for service last week due to a convertible top that has been acting possessed. Occasionally gets stuck in the down position. I expected to hear that it was a malfunctioning motor. As it turns out, the motor is fine, but the convertible top ""computer"" was not getting/sending the proper signals and needs to be replaced. A friggin ""computer"" for the convertible top?? I am beginning to think there really is a geek conspiracy out there.P.S. A couple of years ago, a business associate who's home was the second highest in elevation in Contra Costa County (his one uphill neighbor gets the prize) had his low mileage BMW 7-series struck by lightening, while parked in his driveway. A dime sized burn mark on the hood was all that was visible from the outside. The car was deemed ""totaled"" by his insurance company and went to the boneyard. A $50k+ write-off.

"fedlawman","October 2007"," I checked out the new CTS over the weekend and I've gotta say, I'm pretty impressed. One caveat: I didn't drive a manual, so I won't talk about performance/dynamics right now. Suffice it to say the ride/handling compromise is class appropriate, with a refined driveline that has no bad manners or noticeable deficiencies.Sure, it's not the sportiest car in this segment (it's far to big and heavy for that), but I respect the fact that Cadillac didn't try to beat BMW at their own (increasingly ambiguous) game.Instead, Cadillac has built a car that has one of the nicest, roomiest cabins in this class, and trimmed it with high quality materials and appointments. It's easily the nicest cabin I've ever seen on a GM, and a match in quality and layout to anything in the class. The stitched seams on the soft-touch dashboard covering, and the wood and metallic accents are very pleasing. I found the backseat to be quite comfortable too, although as previously mentioned, the footwell is tight. Exterior styling is definitely too contrived (subjective, I know) - too many angles and random acts of chrome for my tastes, but again, it looks modern and aggressive - even attractive - and for its part, at least it doesn't look like every other car on the road. I have to respect GM for trying something different and mostly pulling it off.Personally, I think the softer, larger, and heavier 3-series has alienated many of the driving enthusiasts interested in this segment, and it will be up to the lighter, more compact 1-series to win us back over BMW. I don't know if the CTS now defines this segment - bigger and more luxurious yet still sporty, but it definitely compares favorably with the BMW and Infinity on the performance-----luxury continuum. Every car in this segment has slid way to the right on that scale over the past few years, so who can fault Cadillac for grabbing tightly onto the right end?What remains to be seen is whether GM can sell it in the volumes it deserves. I don't think the CTS will fail because of its quality, styling, features, or luxury. I think the toughest battle the CTS faces is still the stigma associated with the badge it wears on the hood. "
"cdnpinhead","October 2007"," Interesting. Thanks.You could well be correct with your assessment that Cadillac has squandered their once-revered status. Could be worse, though -- think Lincoln.Either way, the CTS carved a decent niche with its first version, and most appear to fall all over themselves exclaiming over how much better this one is.If Cadillac can get even a few BMW/Audi/Infiniti/MB people to come over, there's a huge cadre of ""buy American"" folks who'll drive it for that reason alone.Looks to me like it's going to be a winner, though it does look strange & a bit gaudy (for my taste, such as it is). "
"fedlawman","October 2007"," Agreed.I think those of us driving enthusiasts who favor BMW's are inherently opposed to gaudiness and flash. Unfortunately, I think we are in the minority.There are many others that want a car that is sporty and luxurious, yet also serves as a fashion statement (style, status, etc.). I've seen enough BMW's wearing 19"" chrome wheels to know that the CTS will be a big success. "
"cdnpinhead","October 2007"," "". . .BMW's wearing 19"" chrome wheels. . .""Oh yes.One of the things than endeared me to the Lincoln LS early on was one of the senior sales executives who would come down like the hammer of Thor on any dealer that put a ""carriage roof"" treatment on an LS. He was a real car guy, but the dealers were as clueless as the day is long, to say nothing of the people who drove Lincolns in 2000 -- all moot these days.BMW endures much of the same, though Cadillac may siphon off some of the more ostentatious with the CTS.

No doubt this will be a success in 2 ways...since the base model will attract yet even younger buyers and the 135 the crowd that craves perfection!Funny thing is when I explained to my wife the 1-series would come in smaller than the current 3'er, she was shocked that I would consider such a small car.

"sevenfeet0","October 2007"," I think the reasonings behind BMW doing the 1 series are pretty simple, and I doubt it came as backlash from 3 series owners (that car still has crazy sales numbers). The fact is that the BMW 3 series had grown in size and purpose from its 2002tii roots and that there was a potential model that could be inserted there now. That combined with the fact that the 3 series is getting so expensive that it is pricing itself out of the hands of its youngest customers makes the business case. "

The Euro-spec BMW 3-Series comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.American-spec BMW 3-Series adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.The Cadillac and Infiniti on the other hand are purpose-built, true luxury/sport sedans that are well worth the $$$ printed on the window sticker: They're roomy, comfortable, leather-lined (the BMW uses vinyl padding-not leather. Think 1970's naugahyde sofa) cruisers with the world's most advanced powertrains and chassis'. "
"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," pm04,Benz actually seems to own the taxi market in Europe but I'm not sure how your taxi thing is a dig against any car. In Asia the Corolla seems to be the most common taxi car. Is that a bad thing? No, but I think you're making an argument that only holds water if you're a status buyer. The Euro-spec BMW 3-Series comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.No in Germany and most of Europe the 3 series comes with a manual standard and 4 cylinder engines. Seriously, do some research. 6 cylinder non-diesel BMWs (and Benzes and Audi/VWs, etc) are pretty rare outside of the USA. The 318d and 320d are actually the more common 3 series in Europe; our 328i's 6 cylinder is considered a luxury and a waste of money; the 335 is primarily for speed junkies in europe as the 330d is the most popular 6 cylinder 3 outside the USA. Gas prices are way too expensive in Europe to opt for a standard gas-burner 6 cylinder.American-spec BMW 3-Series adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.Your ignorance knows no bounds, apparently. Go ahead and visit www.BMW.de ...we'll wait. Hit the 3 and then 3 Limo and Konfigurator. Okay, so for the 318din Germany - that's a 1.8 liter diesel - the starting price is 29,950 euros. In US dollars that's a starting price of $43,966. The 335i in Germany starts at 44,350E or $65,105 US Dollars. Go ahead and check the France, UK and Italy sites if you'd like too. In every case, the 3 series is far more expensive than it is in the USA.Via European Delivery, any US citizen can pick up a 335i in Munich with leather, 6 speed, sport package, xenons, power memory seats, active steering lights, moonroof, comfort access, metallic paint for ~$40,000 US Dollars. I personally, would not opt for leather on another BMW (unlike my 2006 330i that I bought via European Delivery for $35,700 US Dollars), so the price of an ED 335i will run me closer to about 38.5k with the features I do want - ala carte pricing is so nice for those of us who want an exactly spec'ed car.Sadly, an Infiniti G35 with moonroof, leather, sport package, active steering lights, memory seats and 6 speed will run me $38,865 US Dollars. Unfortunately, Infiniti forces me to get packages I don't want - namely a worthless navigation package. Still I'm sure I could negotiate 2500 off that price so we'll say $36,000 US Dollars for the Infiniti. That's cheaper than the 335i still but not by much. Considering I must pay for maintenance on the G35, let's add $1000 to maintain the Infiniti over 4 years /50k miles. So for a $1500 savings I can opt for a car I don't really like, G35, and that doesn't objectively perform as well as a 335i, or just pay the extra $1500 and drive something I like more and that objectively performs better.As I said before: for me with ED the pricing becomes moot and it's about picking the car I like to drive. The comparo swings wildly to the BMW's favor once you negate the pricing. "
"shov8","November 2007"," Just a minor point on your post. You state you can get the G35 configured in a way you don't like (the navigation system), vs. the built-to-order ED 335i. The big caveat here that is not addressed is the ""ED"" part. With ED (European Delivery) you have to physically travel to Munich and pick up the car. ED does include shipping back to the USA and delivery to your dealer (a total of 8-10 weeks later, according to the web site). But the cost of flying to Munich and back, plus at least one night (probably two) in a hotel, isn't included. A sample trip in February 2008 (because you need to allow three months to build the BMW according to bmw.com) from San Diego, CA to Munich runs around $2000 on Expedia. Then there is a night or two in a hotel, plus misc expenses. I'm just getting a ball-park figure, but lets say $2500 minimum for the trip. So that +$1500 cost for the 335i just went up to +$4000 total. True, you do get to go to Munich  so that is a bonus. Of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. Still, we are trying to compare cost, so I think the trip cost should be added in. Since you took delivery of a 330i via ED maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate 335i via ED vs G35 cost comparison. Thanks, kc "

I'd be doing the flight and trip anyway so it's not relevant to the cost, IMHO. Hell, we just spent two weeks in Thailand and had I bought some major ticket item at that moment I wouldn't consider the flight as a cost as I'd be there on vacation anyway. Should I opt for another BMW, I'm fairly sure we'll make a vacation of it as we have friends living in Paris and London. In fact just last night we began talking about a trip to France in late 08 or 09.Since you took delivery of a 330i via ED maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate 335i via ED vs G35 cost comparison. Thanks,Flight = $900 (of course I've got about 200k in Frequent Flyer miles now so it'd be free. Additionally, Lufthansa has a two-for-one BMW special) *Two nights at Munich Marriott - $100 (or use Starwood points for free hotel stays)Train to BMW Delivery Center = $8 euros (about $11 US)Ride to Marriott from Redelivery Center - $35 USLufthansa Airport Shuttle from Munich Marriott to MUC - $14 USFood - ~$100 US (actually far less as food is cheap in Germany)*This was a vacation so I just factored in my Germany costs. In actuality I drove south through Germany, Austria and Switzerland into Italy and then swung west through the South of France.

"shov8","November 2007"," Looks like about $1200 extra from your list of expenses. I think, if it were not for the vacation part, your airfare would be more expensive. Not sure if the airlines like a Saturday night stay like they do domestically, but when I looked prices up on a Tues to Thurs trip it was around $2000 for airfare. I don't think many people will be in your situation, that is, having the time/money to take a vacation and pick up a car. Plus the waiting time to have the car built (three months), then shipped back (8-10 weeks, or more), is a limiting factor for a lot of people. You're talking almost 6 months before you actually get your car in the garage.  I guess my point is, your original post stated that given the ED pricing the 335i wins the comparison, but not everyone can do the ED thing. I'm not saying that getting a 335i for <$40k even with the European trip is a bad thing, far from it, it's just that only a few probably do the ED experience (I wonder how many do it?) given the time/cost factors and therefore ED pricing shouldn't be used as a factor in a car comparison.

"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," I understand your point of view, but can't really agree with it. I'd contend a majority of people buying in the entry-lux market fits a few criteria:1. They already have a car.2. They spend a bit of time looking for a car3. They have the option of waiting for an ordered car - but many choose not to wait. 4. Most are in fairly comfortable jobs that have PTO and most take some kind of vacation.BMW's Roundel mag had an article on ED. The numbers are growing yearly and have been for decades. Still it makes up a small fraction but it's significant enough that Audi kicked in their program this year and it's a bit more generous with knick-knacky silly things like ""free hotel"" stays and such.As for considering it for pricing: most people have the choice.

"habitat1","November 2007"," ED as a way to save money buying a BMW comes up on a regular basis and the pros and cons are debated as if there is a ""right"" answer. There isn't. Having two associates that purchsed BMW's in the last 2 months highlights the differences. The one that purchased via ED took his wife to Europe for a 10 day vacation. They bought a 335i convertible and had a great time enjoying the experience. The cost of the vacation was more thn offset by the savings, especially since the car was not one that is being discounted much, if at all, stateside. He paid $1,500 over ED invoice and saved $5,500+ over the US MSRP.The other person, who previously bought a BMW in 1996 via ED considered going that route again. But given that he now has kids (3) at home and the trip could not be converted, practically or economically, into a family vacation, he decided to buy stateside. He bought an in-stock 550ia at close to invoice, and would have only saved an additional $3,000 going the ED route. He is a freelance attorney, with an hourly billing rate of around $500 and could not justify going away for 3-4 days to essentially save perhaps $1,500, after expenses. For some, the idea of ED is a very appealing way to take advantage of a significant price break, especially on certain models. But I certainly respect that, for others, time is money and the ED savings, while not insignificant, may not meet their ""return"" requirments, given the time it takes.I would agree with the suggestion, however, that ED should at least be explored and considered as an alternative. Almost everyone I know that has done it has had a great experience. The one exception is a friend who's (frequent flier) flight was cancelled and he went through hell and great expense rebooking to pick up the car within the required deadline. But even he admits that, once he got there, it was a worthwhile experience, albeit not much of a savings. "
"circlew","November 2007"," I suspect the 135i will be the new old 3-series. I believe the size/weight is comparable to an E46. Price is $4-5K lower, repectively.BMW this week released preliminary pricing details on the BMW 1-Series coupe, which will go on sale in America in spring 2008. U.S. pricing will start at $29,375 for the 128i and $35,675 for the 135i, with a fully-loaded car costing another ten grand on top of that.The 135i features the same 300+ horsepower twin-turbocharged inline-six as the 335i 3-Series. Predictably, the 128i has the same powerplant as the 328i, delivering 230 horsepower.Pricing for optional equipment on the 128i is not yet available, but the 135i can be ordered with a slew of options pushing its price tag close to $45,000.A six-speed automatic transmission costs $1,275, the Premium Package is $3,300, the Sport Package is $1,000, the Cold Weather kit is $600, Active Steering costs $1,400, paddle shifters are a mere $100, Comfort Access adds $500, power front seats cost $1000, heated front seats are another $500, rear park assist is $350, navigation is $2,100, Bluetooth is $750, HD radio is $350, XM costs $595, premium audio is $875, and iPod adapter is $400, metallic paint adds another $475, and premium Boston Leather is $1,450.Since many of these standalone options are included in larger options packages, adding up all the prices won't give an accurate estimate of the cost of a fully-loaded 135i. However, taking packages into consideration, we've determined a fully-loaded 135i would cost $44,500.Regards,OW "

"habitat1","November 2007"," I'm not a BMW marketing exec and, in fact, have never even owned one. But this notion that BMW is overpricing its cars is, based upon some hard historical data I've looked at, is absurd.Sorry I can't go back to the days of the sardine can 2002 tii for my analysis, but thanks to an old Kelly Blue Book, I can go back 20 years. Here are some figures for you to digest (all base MSRP prices):BMW Prices: 1987 325i Sedan - $28,190 2007 328i Sedan - $32,400 Increase in Percentage - 14.9%Honda Prices: 1987 Accord LX - $13,752 2007 Accord LX - $20,925 (4 cylinder) Increase in Percentage - 52.2%Toyota Prices: 1987 Corolla LE - $8,853 2007 Corolla LE - $16,315 Increase in Percentage - 84.3%I'm sorry, guys, I'm not tryong to sound elitist, but, in the past, BMW was a relatively EXPENSIVE car to be ASPIRED to. I graduated from a top 10 business school with an MBA in 1981 and looked forward to the day when I might be able to afford a BMW. That was Director/VP territory, not standard fare for an entry level analyst. Today, the 328i is barely priced above a loaded Accord V6 ($30k+ MSRP for the EX-L V6). The 3 series has never been cheaper, relatively speaking. And the fact that the 1-series apparantly won't undercut that price by the 30% some would like to see is frankly, too damn bad. The 135 has nearly 50 more horsepower than the original M1, for goodness sakes. It's hardly your Dad's 1600/2000 which, by the way, were WAY more than twice as expensive as the Honda Civics of their vintage. So pony up for a BMW 3 series or 1 series if you can afford it. But stop your bellyaching if you can't. Because you sure as hell wouldn't have been driving a 3 series 20 years ago either, if that's the case today. I, for one, don't want to see BMW stoop to cost cutting or ""value engineering"" just to compete for the dollars that probably should be more prudently spent on a Honda or Toyota. "
"tayl0rd","November 2007"," That just proves that BMW's pricing was even more absurd back then than it is now!

Nice, but overpriced all the same. "
"habitat1","November 2007"," On the one hand, I should be congratulating you on getting an exceptional car. But given your statement, I have to question your prudence for buying a car you think is overpriced. Value is highly subjective and relative, but 6 years ago, when I decided the difference between a $32k Honda S2000 and a $55k Boxster S was not worth it, I bought the S2000. Two years ago, under different circumstances, I bought a 911S. My priorities and value equation had changed. But I still shopped like hell to get a $10k+ discount. No need to overpay. I would never brag about buying a car (or anything) that I truly thought was overpriced relative to the alternatives or its intrinsic value to me. It makes one seem like they have more dollars than sense.In any event, enjoy your 550i. And take some consolation that it would probably hold its own against a 1988 M5 which ran $49,050 back then.

Yes the 335i is 38% more than the 1987 325i, but then the current top of the line Accord EX-L V6 at $30,260 is 96% more than the top of the line 1987 Accord LX-i 4 door at $15,434. And, if you want to get really off track, the current 335i compares very favorably performance and size wise to a 1988 M5 that ran $49,050, 26% MORE than the current 335i. To answer your question, the 1987 325 (no ""e"" or ""i"") had a base price of $24,655. So the current 328i has a base price 33.0% higher than the bottom of the line 3 series in 1987. But again, comparing bottom of the line Accords, the current LX 4 cylinder manual at $20,360 is 87.2% more than the 1987 DX at $10,874. Whether or not some consider the current 3 series or upcoming 1 series too big, too heavy, not as much fun as the little 3 series or 1600/2000's of old is a completely different matter. But when you look just at the price, it's hard not to conclude that there are more people that can afford a 3 series today that could have only dreamed of one in 1987. BMW's sales figures and increases in market share seem to reflect this. And there may be at least a few people who can't afford an Accord today, that could have in 1987. They are now buying Hyundai's and the like.P.S. A 1994 850 CSi? $101,500. :surprise: "

And at cruising speed, the sound of the V8 completely disappears. The I6 definitely makes enough fuss at speed to make it known that it's working hard for you. In a 3-series, that's tolerable. In a 5-series, at that price, it's totally unacceptable. That's why, when I was still searching, my focus was mainly on the V8 cars (A6 4.2, M45, E550, GS430, 550i.)

So, you can't really compare resale prices of a limited production car like the M5 to a mass produced 550i. The 2007 that the dealer called me on has an MSRP of $69,880. I told him not to waste my time unless he's weilling to take at least $9,000 off and his response was that I could have the car for $61k tomorrow, if I wanted it. At this particiular dealership, if I had asked for a $500 discount on a 2003 M5, I would have been laughed out of the showroom. "
"tayl0rd","November 2007"," You did see where I said ""it was probably sold in 2002 which means it's near 6 calendar years old,"" right? We're heading headlong into 2008 right now. 2008 - 2002 = 6Near means close, but not quite, or next to, or in the vacinity of. :PAnd why can't I compare the prices? An M5 depreciates the same as any other 5-series. It just has a much higher initial price, and price gouging is NEVER accounted for in resale. The depreciation is relatively the same. Limited edition or not, it's still an outdated model. The mass produced thing is also relative. I believe someone (wasn't it you?) said there are actually more M5s in the States than there are V8 5-series, year-to-year. That would make a V8 non-M 5-series more exclusive and rare than an M5. So my 550i Sport should theoretically hold it's relative value better than an M5!  Especially with it being a stick. "
"spiritinthesky","November 2007"," I happen to own a 2003 M5 with 45k miles. And, coincidentally, before I bought the M5, I had been all set to purchase a 545i Sport 6-speed. The party that had the M5 on order defaulted, dealer called me and I came in with a check for full MSRP that afternoon. The M5 certainly depreciates, but not proportionally as much as the standard V8 5-series. At least not in my (Pittsburgh) area. I paid $75,800 for mine, and have been offered $38,000 in cash (not trade) by the dealer. The 545i had an MSRP of $62,000 and would probably be worth around $26,000 today (rough estimate by my dealer). The big difference is that the M5 has a dedicated enthusiast following. Everyone knows what it is. The 545i/550i 6-speeds are very nice cars, but less than 10% of V8 buyers opt for the 6 speed. The vast majority are automatics and sold to an affluent, but not necessarily ""driving enthusiast"" demographic. That definitely makes resale a bit more of a challenge and my dealer indicated he would only take a 545/550 of any kind on a trade (would not buy for cash). I didn't buy the M5 with resale value being a high consideration. But I'm pretty sure that if I looked at the numbers, I'd get most of the additional $15k I spent on the M5 over the 545i back, if I decided to part with it tomorrow. But I have no interest in doing that. It still drives like the day I bought it and there really is nothing sweeter in a sedan than that hand built M engine effortlessly running up to redline or that sport suspension handling the curves almost as well as my 911 Turbo. P.S. I bought in May 2003, making it exactly 4 1/2 years old. As in precisely. "
"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," 2008s are on the lot. Whether you bought that 2003 car in January of 2004 or September of 02, a 2003 car is viewed as 5 years old. "

"lovemyclk","November 2007"," As a 2003 530SP owner (Titanium Silver/Black), this is one beautiful M5! All mine lacks is the punch from the new TT motor, but I'd seriously give a clean, low-mileage '03 M5 a close look.It only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, but agree tht it is priced at least 5-7K too high.

Very nice car. 6-sp only at this time, with Tiptronic on the way around April '08. Drives beautifully as a high performance touring coupe. Would not even consider a MB CLK after driving the S5. 335 Coupe is still strong, IMO, due to being such a great performer.

Even discounting the huge shift in brand perception over the past decades, you can't make apples to apples comparisons when the vehicles aren't even in the same class anymore. "
"circlew","December 2007"," Here is some news. I could not tell if some of the models will be applicable and perhaps some of the future names could be part of the ELLPS category. It just goes to show the continued muddied direction that boggles the mind!If you liked alphabet soup as a kid, make an appointment at your Cadillac dealer for three to five years from now. That's because GM has recently trademarked several new nameplates for Cadillac, and so far we're worried and a bit confused.At present, these names are trademarked in Europe and Canada. However, companies often register their trademarks in foreign markets first, and later in the United States.This potential new naming system is undoubtedly complicated, but we will try and lay it out in the simplest way possible. So far, GM has trademarked: * DT7 * CT6 * CT5 * BT3 * AT1 * DTX * CTX * BTXWe suspect the numbers in each name signifies each vehicle's overall size.The ""DT7"" might be the eventual DTS replacement, for example. This large, luxury sedan may end up riding on the Zeta chassis in a few years time.The CT6 and CT5 would be some kind of variants of the car we currently know as the CTS. One possibility is the numbers indicate two possible wheelbase lengths. On the other hand, we can't rule out the ""5"" and ""6"" being the current CTS sedan and forthcoming CTS coupe.The BT3 could represent the next-generation BLS. This vehicle would probably be on the Epsilon II chassis, however, with GM's plans on the new Alpha chassis being unclear, there is always a possibility BT3 could be an Alpha car.The AT1 is still a bit of a mystery. That said, it's a safe bet that this would be a small car that is definitely based on the Alpha chassis GM is currently developing. Could it be a competitor to the BMW 1-Series?The ""X"" cars will more than likely denote crossover or wagon vehicles. However we'd also leave open the option that the ""X"" indicates all-wheel-drive models.If the crossover assumption is true, the DTX is probably the vehicle currently known as the BRX. The CTX could be the forthcoming CTS wagon, and the BTX remains a mystery.Of course, the all-wheel-drive option is also a strong possibility. The CTX could be an AWD CT6 or CT5, while the DTX would be an AWD DT7, and so on.Obviously there is one glaring part of Cadillac's lineup not mentioned here &#151; the Escalades. Some might suggest that the ""X"" vehicles we just talked about are in fact the trucks. However, given what our sources say, we don't think that's the case.That leaves a few options. One being that GM just hasn't gotten around to coming up with new names. Another being that the true Cadillac trucks will not be part of this new scheme and continue on with regular names. With the marketing power the Escalade name carries, we think the latter is more likely. :confuse: Regards,OW "
"vic10","December 2007"," Am I the only one who thinks this new branding (Cadillac is not alone) is just a stupid gimmick?

I'm sure there were better places to spend the money.... "

"laurasdada","December 2007"," Just the facts... Not a bash. While it appears that GM is beginning to produce some worth(ier) products, this kind of recall just reinforces that last 30+ years of GM ""quality."" All mfg.'s have recalls and quality issues. It's just that the domestics have a streak going that, while hopefully slowing down, continues... If, instead of pouring millions of $ into the ad campaign that ""Quality is Job 1,"" Ford had spent that money on improving quality, who knows???And, while I remain really ticked off at the domestics (because, there is no doubt in my mind that GM/Ford/Chrysler could build world class cars. In fact, in Europe I think that they do), I'm not a basher (well, certainly not as much as I used to be...!) Hey,my last car was a Chrysler 300M, really enjoyed it. Some initial quality issues taken care of under warranty. No issues outside the warranty period, but still being a Chrysler I wasn't going to keep it too long out of warranty... Also, build quality was certainly less than spectacular. But, still enjoyed that car! And, I'm considering a (used) Caddy XLR as a toy. But, the interior far from reflects the price and, well, it's a GM... :P My current ride, assembled here in Los Estados Unidos, is certainly screwed together to much higher tolerances than the Chrysler. No issues, other than a couple of rattles, at 33k+ miles.So anyway, Happy Holidays to all. Gotta find all the receipts for the gifts that don't fit the Evil Wife. :sick: (Luckily for me, they're too big!!!) "
"circlew","December 2007"," It's interesting and quite ironic, really, that the US needs to import cars like the G8 to get the higher level of build quality for a dying brand. Like I've said before, Caddy just does not pique my interest in the least even with the new CTS. No bash intended...just a personal choice. BTW, I saw a Catera on Saturday and felt more pain!I once toyed with the idea of an XLR as a fun car but considering it's a 'Vette clone, why not just the C6 'verte? The edges are NOT appealing IMO.All the best during the Holidays and Happy New Year!Regards "
"laurasdada","December 2007"," And to you, OW, Happy/Merry!You ever have an inexplicable car desire (Bricklin, DeLorean, Subaru SVX)? Mine appears to be the XLR. I think it's the HT convertible, just a gadget that has always appealed to me. And overall I like the exterior style of the XLR. Of course, I don't like some of the GM-cheapness e.g. the plastic looking grille and, well, the interior. Indeed the issue for me (and I'll assume many potential XLR buyers) is the price. Even a couple of years used, the asking prices compare to some formidable new cars, e.g. aforementioned Corvette, Audi A/S5 and BMW 3, Jag XF among others...So, more than likely it will be an unfulfilled inexplicable desire. Probably should just save my nickels for a new/cpo Jag XK: Beeeeautiful. Or a Maser Gran Turismo: Mas Beeeeatuiful...My father, in what I can only assume was a moment of insanity and charity, bought a Catera. He was surprisingly happy with the ride and comfort. Unfortunately, the opportunity to enjoy said ride was somewhat limited by its penchant to visit the service bay... :sick: Least reliable car he's ever owned...But, recent recalls aside (and can they be put aside?), I think the new CTS is a winner, especially for a GM! The first CTS, to me, was a styling abomination both outside and, even more so, inside. But, it sold, so good for GM!Do Australian-built cars offer quality? I thought not...? "
"clarkster","December 2007"," My sentiments EXACTLY laurasdada!!! Never have I drooled so much over a prospective car as I have the XLR. I just think it's a bit cost prohibitive for me. Such a SEXY luxury sports car though. If I could find an 07 in the low $50k price range, I'd jump on it like a duck on a junebug! So I stumble upon the CTS yesterday and have been under the ether ever since! What a car...and over $30K less than a new XLR once all the options are added to it! I'd already have ordered one online had it not been for a few articles I've read about this mysterious CTC-Coupe that might be coming out this summer. Now I could certainly wait til August if that is indeed the case. No one seems to know for sure yet...maybe next month we'll find out for sure.I just wish the XLR were a bit more reasonable.

"vic10","January 2008"," I doubt that those who willing pay a premium price for the privilege of being able to say they drive a BMW or Mercedes will even be aware that Hyundai has a car named Genesis (if they are even aware of a car company named Hyundai.). More than likely the Genesis will pull buyers from the Azera, who are mainly Avalon wannabees, and maybe from the Avalon itself. If Hyundai really wants to make an impact on the upscale market, they need to do what Toyota did with Lexus: Create a new brand with separate dealerships manned with obsequious sales staff. Make the brand flawless and then wait several years for a reputation to build. "
"blueguydotcom","January 2008"," The brand didn't make Lexus...the LS400 did. The car. The brand was meaningless. 20 years ago everybody scoffed at the notion of the Japanese making a RWD V8 sedan that could compete with BMW and MB. The Lexus dealerships had nothing to do with sales; the product and the price sold the Lexus LS400 and made Lexus into what it is today (highly overpriced). Euro snobs laughed at the Japanese competitors and said people wanted an established brand. People wanted a luxury nameplate. People bought the badge. And that's somewhat true. Of course, Lexus also offered a 35k v8 luxury sedan that undercut the Euro competition by well over 10k. Suddenly luxury sedans were well within reach for people who didn't want to fork over dough for a Jag, Benz or Bimmer.The Genesis will appeal to the same folks and I really seeing it hitting Infiniti, Lexus and Acura the hardest (most likely Acura and Infiniti will take it hard). Why spend 50k on an M45 or 5 series when you can get a Genesis for 40k and it's decked out the same way? "
"louiswei","January 2008"," If Lexus is overpriced then just about every other luxury brand (exclude Infiniti) is overpriced, including MB and BMW. However, that's another subject all together.I wouldn't say the dealership and service had nothing to do with Lexus' success. True, without the car, the brand is nothing but Lexus' success was built on a decent car at good value (the LS400 was not THAT good) and industry leading dealership experience and service. There are many folks out there who don't know what Edmunds is but like to be treat like kings and queen and Lexus captured them perfectly. Lexus may not know how to build a better driving machine than BMW but they sure do know how to make their brand ""luxurious"" and how to treat their customers right.Personally I don't think Lexus, Infiniti and Acura have much to worry about with the Genesis. IMO the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Pontiac G8, Buick Lucerne, Toyota Avalon and Hyundai's own Azera are going to be the biggest loser due to the Genesis launch.No (okay, very little) luxury buyer is going to be attracted to a car whose manufacture is too shameful to put its emblem on the hood (or grille)...

The dealer network may have had a part in repeat sales but initially it was all about a luxury car nearly on par with BMW/MB/Jag for a crazy deal.

I think Hyundai will pull in plenty of aspirational buyers. "

I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now...) the reviews: shock and awe. The LS was very much Mercedes-like at ~1/2 the price. The Q was very much BMW-like at ~1/2 the price. But, of course, Infiniti opted for the classic ""Rocks and Sticks"" ad campaign...The lesser models of Lexus and Inifiniti were just that, lesser. Filler to get folks into the showroom. I agree with BGDC, the big dogs made the marques (much less so Infiniti, of course. They had a much longer and winding road to today's level of success). The dealer service was also a selling point.

Had the G35 been priced the same as the 3 series, regardless of dealer experience, do you think it would have done 4-6k units a month?

The first gen was dirt cheap, rouge around the edges and it challenged BMW (and MB/Audi to some bit). The latest one, just like newer gens of the LS, got more expensive and became more refined. "

"habitat1","January 2008"," Back when the Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45 first came out, I was working for a Fortune 500 company and every other VP and SVP started looking at them. Some of it was the better price/value they offered, but at least as much of it was the fear of expensive repairs and maintenace headaches. Lexus gave very good luxury- albeit in a boring to drive chassis - with Toyota like dependability.By the way, I always enjoy looking back in my old Kelly Blue Book as to what those cars actually cost at the time. The Lexus and Infiniti came out in 1990, but giving them a year to ""establish"" themselves, here are the comparisons from the 1991 model year:Lexus LS 400: $41,650 / 110"" wheelbaseInfiniti Q45: $40,385 / 113"" wheelbaseMercedes E300: $47,550 / 110"" wheelbaseMercedes S420: $64,800 / 121"" wheelbaseMercedes S560: $76,750 / 121"" wheelbaseBMW 535i: $43,600 / 108"" wheelbaseBMW 735i: $56,500 / 116"" wheelbaseSo the Lexus and the Infiniti were sized between the 5/E and 7/S classes, but priced below the 5/E.What is really interesting is how little Mercedes and BMW prices have increased since 1991. Their ""fat days"" came to an end after Lexus, Infiniti and Acura came to the US - and today BMW's and Mercedes are certainly not exclusively the territory of VP's and above on the corporate ladder. Heck 16 years ago a 1992 Mercedes SL500 roadster had an MSRP of $100k. More than a 2008 Porsche 911S Cabriolet! And more than a 2008 SL550! "
"fedlawman","January 2008"," It's not just the luxury cars. The MSRP's of the 1991 Nissan 300ZX Turbo, Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, and BMW M3 were all in the mid to upper $30K's.Considering that today, $35K buys a 300hp Subaru STi or BMW 135i, you can see just how exotically priced those early-90's halo cars truly were. On the other hand, I guess one has to consider the cost of the technology back then to mass produce a car that basically, in 1991, had the same performance specs as the current crop of hot GT cars. For instance, put the 300ZX TT and 135i side by side and, by today's standards, the Nissan still holds up (in both performance and styling). Pretty impressive actually... "

"habitat1","January 2008"," In relative Dollar Value terms, the 1991 S560 would cost $113,603 today. The '08 S550 is $86,700 base but the S600 is $144,200 I think you are a little light on your ""relative value"" calculation. Your figure represents a 48% increase over 17 years (2.33% annual compounded). CPI datea shows about a 57.1% increase over the past 17 years. CPIOn that basis, the 1991 S560 would now cost about $120,600. A 1992 600SEL had an MSRP of $132,650, or the equivalent of $196,400 today. And that 1992 600SEL is less powerful than the base 2008 S550. The AMG's are in a completely different league. I don't particularly buy the CPI, however. In 1991 a year's tuition at my alma mater was $13,100. In 2008, it is $35,500, a 170% increase.

"activex111","March 2008"," hi,i am pretty much down to Audi A3 or IS 250 when looking for a smaller luxury car. Both have excellent mileage and that was one of the main factor giving the gas prices these days. Thinking of 2006 Audi A3 or 2005 IS250. Liked the interior of IS250, but it is still pricey. Not sure which one to choose. i am trying to compare the common issues, maintenance costs and dealer/mfg customer service levels..Any help? THANKS "
"shipo","March 2008"," Don't know if a back seat is important to you, however, while I'm only 5'8"", when I got in the IS250 and set the front seat for my body, I was almost unable to get into the left rear seat. Trying the same thing in the A3 was a breeze as there is easily two to three inches more overall leg room in the Audi.Best Regards,Shipo "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," We've got an A3 - 2006 with DSG. In terms of room it's far, far bigger inside than the Lexus. We easily take 4 adults in an A3. We use it to make trips to costco, storage, etc. Shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well. We paid 22k for it in March 2007 and with 27k miles it's still worth at least 21k. The engine's powerful, yet the car gets great gas mileage and the DSG is still fun to play with. It handles poorly but then again so does the Lexus. On the downside, Audi service is horrible. I had no idea how good I had it with BMW until I took our Audi in for the ""free"" maintenance. One of the passenger door lock switches blistered and the rubber came off it. The scumbags at Audi of America said it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply. They said repair of the SWITCH would be $300. Seriously, how awful is Audi? My wife swore up and down, telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an Audi again. A 2 year old car with a blistered door switch and it's not covered by the warranty? That's obscene - especially when it's obviously a defect, not a result of wear or tear.  Lexus typically builds bulletproof cars and I'm betting the IS follows suit. Service is pricey but rarely needed. "

I keep checking the value and the car's been a rock too - which was my goal when I bought it. I have an appointment with my BMW dealer to try the 1 when it comes in. I've seen it in person and love the pudgy, aggressive, tall look of the car. My wife's sure we can fit a baby in the back easily but I'm not sold. Still, I'll take one for a spin (ideally a 128 as I don't see the value in the 135 yet). "

We brought it to the dealer numerous times during her 3 years lease for the problem and we got the ""they all do that"" or ""the transmission has to learn how you drive"" or ""we were unable to replicate the problem"" responses. Besides having to wait 3-4 weeks for an appointment, we actually made an appointment for the Audi Rep to come and drive the car.

I show the FWD A3 at 35.1, the best of all the cars I've been considering, most of which are RWD. OTOH, my comparison matrix (yes, my screen name is apropos) shows the IS250 at 35.5 feet, not the ~33.5 foot number you cite.Either way, CV joints take a real beating in FWD cars at the extremes of steering-wheel travel, so there is probably a longevity benefit to not allowing them to go as far as they might otherwise.

"scottm123","March 2008"," Can I chime in? :blush: My short list was the IS250, the Acura TL and the G35x.I drove the IS250 and although fit and finish was outstanding, the size was a deal breaker for me, since I had a 4 yr old daughter who had to be comfy in the back. The lack of power had me worried about the novelty wearing off as well.That brought me to the TL and the G35x.I had to really weigh the pros and cons to come to a decision. Honestly, both are awesome cars and you can't go wrong with either one.For me, the G just gave me a feeling that the TL could not. The dealer, where I bought my 06 MDX, gave me a TL loaner on 7 separate days... one being a Type-S as well.As much as I enjoyed them (especially the MPG), I got bored with them.The G (for me) is WAY more fun to drive. It has more power and I felt more in control of the G as well. It offers more feedback (in a good way)I now have AWD when I need it (It's fantastic in the snow!) and RWD performance at any other time.Also, I found that my right knee hits the center console in the TL and my left arm, which I like to rest on the window edge, was uncomfortable. The window edge was too high and the arm rest was too low.The ""Studio on Wheels"" stereo in the G is more enjoyable and I also feel that the fit/finish/ level of luxury in the G is higher than that of the TL. I love the look of the real rosewood trim in my car and how it contrasts with the black interior.I also have absolutely no rattles after 14,000 miles and one year of driving.Again, this is all personal preference.I liked both cars, but the G just did it better for me.

I was looking for ""Affordable"" fun to drive luxury car, that's why A3 and IS250. I agree that A3 has a punch to its drive, but practically everyone shares that the Audi dealer service is bad, including my own test drive experience .. May be Audi has a special program, ""How to treat your customers like crap!!"":O). apart from the drive, if are going to keep the car for atleast 2-3 yrs, then the whole experience counts (pouring oil, dealer visits etc).. I checked IS250 again and again and the rear seat looks more tighter to me every time ) I usually dont have passengers in my car but, the rear space almost looks like it i made for kids, thats why i am leaning towards A3 now. Saw a 2006 A3 for with 30K miles for $24K and a 2006 IS250 with 35K miles for $27K.. Granted R8 must be much more fun, but it wont be when you sign that monthly payment check My quest (still....) continues.. "
"louiswei","March 2008"," But hard to beat the 4.8 to sixty. Wait, I thought the straight line performance isn't all that important in a sports sedan... "
"louiswei","March 2008"," Yes, the IS250's rear seat is REAL  tight, to have adults sitting in the back on any trips over an hour would be a pretty terrible idea. However, since my rear seat is normally unoccupied about 99.9% of the time that's really not an issue for me.My suggestion is that make sure you think about this thoroughly, if the tight rear seat bugs you then just turn around and look for something else.

"plekto","March 2008"," How is the RX-8 not a entry-level performance sedan? (luxury being mostly artificial leather and fake wood trim on any of these, I don't consider ANY of these ""luxury"" cars).Oh wait - you're actually going to claim that the IS250 actually has a useable middle rear seat? These cars are plainly built to fit four people, which is what the RX-8 does as well. And none will fit a linebacker in the rear seat, so I fail to see that point, either. The rear seats are there for kids and the occasional third adult in these small sedans. It's not a coupe, either - that's visual trickery. There really are four doors on it. I'd recommend at least driving it. Mazda's lack of positioning it properly or marketing it well aside, it's .1 second slower than a Porsche Cayman and is virtually identical on the track. For half the price. There's just nothing that comes close to it in its price range as far as performance goes. But it's like Hyundai or Volvo if you want to go back even further. People gave Volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 Turbo. And it blew the doors off of everything in its price range. Yes, it wasn't a Mercedes. Nobody who owned one cared - they were too busy having a blast driving them.$29K on and IS250, $32K on a 328i, $28K on an A4... or $24K on a RX-8. CarsDirect Price: $23,843(including delivery). That's an enormous amount cheaper than the competition. You could load one up with every last option offered and still not be at what a bare-bones IS250 goes for(no leather, either).CarsDirect Price: $28,710 - IS250. No HID headlamps, no heated seats, no sport suspension, no ... (don't even gt me started on the A4 in base trim) Add that stuff in ad it jumps to $33K almost instantly.CarsDirect Price: $28,408 - RX-8 GT/+ rear spoiler. If you want more bling, you have to start adding chrome and after-market accessories.$5K out the door cheaper buys a lot of gas.(5pmg difference is roughly 7100 gallons to make up at 3.50 a gallon)It's also the same reason a Prius is a no-win situation versus a Civic. 5mpg difference for thousands more in initial price is going to take you well over a decade to recover. Maybe two. "

I like the RX-8, a lot, and I think that the IS250 is a total poseur sporting sedan that is numb to drive and has such a small back seat that I wouldn't even subject my 14 year old to it for a trip to school.

"riorebel","March 2008"," Honestly, there are some good reasons you might choose the TL over the G35, but my main reason was my wife. She has a strange dislike of most Japanese cars, particularly Nissan (I think it goes back to one bad experience with a Sentra we had about 10 years ago.) When I took her with me to drive the G35, she hated it - a biased opinion, I'm sure. But I have to admit that it is a bit smaller than the TL, and I also like the slightly better mileage and the look of the TL better, as well.By the way, I am a HUGE Bama fan and I was pulling hard for you.

Nobody wants to say, look at a Hyundai Tiburon or a Volvo S40T5 or whatnot most of the time. It's their money I guess, but as I pointed out, the price difference buys a decade's worth of extra gas and then some(140K miles or so for 5mpg difference!). The smart money is to ignore the inflated bling-mobiles where you're plainly paying through the nose for their products and instead start looking at the alternatives.Honestly, I'd rather own a blinged-out WRX than a base 328i with pleather and that miserable base engine. You can always add leather to a car, or a sunroof, even after-market if you have to, so you have to think really hard about the following question:- Is the car primarily an entry-level luxury or entry-level sportscar? IME, when people talk about this segment, bling is of far lower importance than the performance. It's always ""I got a BMW and yeah it has leather and some nice features(revs the engine and grins)"". Not, ""I got this C Class and yeah it is sort of sporty"" :P So ignore the bling and badge. Find a nice sportscar and add the bling in. Almost every maker has silly levels of luxury and bling as packages these days. You'll find that the field widened considerably. "
"sjaieve","March 2008"," You know what, you just described a lesson I learnt the hard way. I bought one of the luxury brands I noted in my earlier post, it had the base engine and had lots of toys, real leather, real wood, almost everything. That base engine was crap, I mean everybody from Honda Accord to Honda Civic Si was faster than me in my Luxury brand. I learnt that the engine comes first with a car, then consider the luxury component. I sold the base luxury sedan recently (after one and a half years of onwership) and got a 3.5 litre, +300hp luxury brand. Now I am happy.I left out the names cos I dont want to seem as if I am bashing the other car cos other than the engine, that car was awesome "

The RX-8 wins as a better track vehicle, the IS250 with AWD wins as a better street vehicle. The RX-8 has to be revved to the moon to get horsepower.

Higher quality interior bits and pieces.Better mpg (child of ""gas crisis"" '70s...)I didn't really want the added weight/complexity of AWD. I'm a lifelong New Englander and skier, FWD has just done me fine (until the TL! Another story, but get snow tires...)Of course, this was Gen 1 G35. Fun to drive, powerful and I'm sure had I chosen it I'd be all smiles. But, my priorities ruled in the TLs favor.

I cant dispute that, the sales support this. You took the argument to a segment I am not very familiar with, as I said before, I can't afford the car in that segment, and my comments will not really hold water, but here goes.For 52k, I can get an almost fully loaded GS350. For the same amount, I am not going to get the same options in the 528, now, given that the GS350 is faster than the 528, I think the Lex is a better buy. I dont believe one should drive a car that is worth 50k and have cheaper cars, run circles around such a car. This to me is totaly unacceptable. If one pays 50k, you need a car that has everything else that the cheaper cars have, plus more. The GS350 gives you that, the 528 does not.I believe BMW makes good cars, but the pricing does not make sense to me, I attribute the higher prices to lack of the economies of scale that Nissan and Toyota has, since their luxury brands share the same parts as the parent company's cars.

I think the hate for Toyotas stems from her having a bad experience with a Corolla (her first car) like 10 years ago (I think it was a '92). She doesn't even want me to look at Lexus. On a side note, my parents have been buying Toyotas for the past 10 years and love them. My mom drives a '97 Avalon (bought brand new in '97), and has only put 32,000 on it in the last 10-11 years (she just pretty much goes to the store and goes home).riorebel, thanks for the SEC support.

I will stick with facts here, the engine used in the Lexus 3.5 litre engine is in the wards top ten list, together with the 335i's engine.

"shipo","March 2008"," I think that you are entirely too caught up in straight line acceleration, and if that's your only yardstick, go buy a WRX and be done with it.

When I leased my 2002 530i I made the conscious decision NOT to get a 540i (or an M5 for that matter). Why? Because the 530i was plenty fast enough for my needs, wants and desires. I don't constantly need to prove my manhood by blowing every slammed Honda away at every light, I buy the car for me. Period, full stop, the end.Some time in the next year I'll be buying a new car, and the top five contenders are as follows:1) Audi 2.0T 6-Speed S-Line (via European Delivery)2) 2001-2003 BMW 530i Sedan 5-Speed Sport Package3) BMW 328i Coupe 6-Speed Sport Package (via European Delivery)4) BMW 328i Sedan 6-Speed Sport Package (via European Delivery)2) 2001-2002 BMW 540i Sedan 6-Speed Sport PackageNotice that every one of those cars can be had with a bigger/badder/faster (and thirstier) engine. FWIW, the only reason why the 540i is on the list is that I really like E39s with a stick shift and lots of other goodies, goodies that are often hard to find in the 530i but yet seem to be on virtually every 540i from that vintage.Best Regards,Shipo "

"chirocat","March 2008"," You should also ask yourself how you are going to use the car. If you are going to be using it on the track vs a daily driver. Then ask how you drive, some of these cars have very little torque and have to be revved to get average acceleration, as I get older I find it more irritating. Last December I narrowed the choice down to a TL-S, a G35, a CTS-V and a few others. I went with the TL-S and it's pretty much the perfect daily driver. Sure I notice the torque steer and it may only do the 1/4 mile in 14.1, but I can't really use all of that on a daily basis anyway. The other stuff, it's amazing Honda reliability, compliant ride, and upscale interior make daily driving pleasant. The slick 6 speed manual is a joy to row and the engine has enough torque that I can dust 95% of the cars without even engaging the V-Tec. The best part is that despite a heavy foot in the city part of my commute and a median speed of 80 mph on the freeway, I still average 23 MPG. I have just over 3k miles so the mileage might even get better. It's hard to beat this combo. If it was RWD it would be even better. Next year they are talking SH-AWD but I doubt it will have a manual box, so my next car will probably be a 335 or similar. "

"lockgiants","March 2008"," Personally I think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the G and TL serve slightly differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. I bought a TL for a simple reason: value and location. I didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded G35 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the G better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded tl for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the power, the G or the IS350 are better options. but the TL is a much quieter ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either.

"pat","March 2008"," how 'bout we back to these cars now? "
"chirocat","March 2008"," I really liked the G35, the studio on wheels is a nice concept and the compact flash slot was a better idea than an Ipod jack IMHO. The biggest complaint I have with the G35 is the pathetic lack of overdrive in 6th gear. My previous car was a 98 Maxima and it was tiring having the engine at 3300 rpm for my entire freeway commute. The G35 gearing was almost the same, whereas the TL-S is much more relaxed on the freeway, cruising well under 3000 RPM (2750). A few milder negatives with the G was the lack of smoothness in the clutch and some vibration in the shifter, and the insurance was also a good chunk more, at least with my company(interestingly, the R32 was the most expensive). I added all these together with a lack of enthusiasm for a good deal and the TL-S got the nod. I probably would have loved the G35 too, and might have taken it if the gearing had been better. Either way, you can't go wrong, they are all awesome cars. :shades: "

"adamr001","March 2008"," I test drove a lot of cars before I chose the G35. The TL was one of them. My main complaint about the TL was / is FWD. The car has all the usual FWD problems and didn't handle being ""upset"" in mid-corner nearly as well as the RWD cars I tested (nor as well as some of the other FWDs (9-3) either). I liked the car, I liked the price, but I couldn't get past the FWD and handling.If you test drive a G35, make sure and test drive one with 4-wheel Active Steering. Seriously. The difference between a Sport and 4WAS-Sport still amazes me. Some of the other cars I test-drove were:Lexus IS350 : Only complaints, rear seats slightly too small, no Manual Transmission option, otherwise this was the ""best"" car I drove from an overall perspective.BMW335i : Excellent car, but it felt a bit soulless. It didn't leave me just drooling and wanting to get back in and drive. I can't really explain it better than that. I just didn't wow me.BMW328i : Not in the same ballpark as the other cars I drove. Lacks the power.Saab 9-3 Aero : FWD again, but otherwise this was a fun car and was 3rd in my ranking.There were a few more, but they were more sport than luxury (WRX STi, VW STi, etc.)Ultimately, it's all about what you want.I wanted (in order of importance)4 doorsSportLuxury interior + toysManual TransmissionThus I chose the G35.

"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," I thought I'd chime in here, since my main decision was between the TL and G35.I have been a Honda guy, so at first was not even considering the G35, and so was looking at the TL, especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08's before the 09's came in. A friend recommended I look at the G35's, so at first I just went to the dealership and looked at them (on a Sunday so I couldn't test drive one), and I thought the looks and interior were very impressive looking, and so decided I would consider it.I test drove the TL (not type S) and, while it was solid, I was not swept away. I was a bit disappointed with the low-end power and responsiveness. I then test drove the G35 and was blown away with how the engine performed. Very responsive, and I like the way the transmission adapts to the driver's driving style.I thought I'd end up paying a lot more for the G35 given the incentives offered on the TL's, but actually found that the G35 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. The 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate I could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total ""incentive saving"" of about $2500, greater than the TL incentive. Also, I was able to get a deal for slightly below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car I wanted (Journey with Premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal interior) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. This is not far from what I could get on a TL, even with the model changing, and this way I get a car that is a new body design (as of 07) and is the car I like better.Anyway, I think both cars are great, but I prefer the G35. My main issue was the engine's performance and exterior styling.Jeff "

"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," Good point on the fuel economy. The G35 seems to average 17-19mpg in mixed driving, while the TL is in the low 20's. I think the 5-speed automatic has something to do with that, since even on the highway it revs at a pretty high rpm.Jeff "

"adamr001","March 2008"," Well my observations are that even with the 6mt gas milage is determined by how often you keep your foot on the accellerator. If you can avoid on/off your milage will increase. It doesn't seem to matter (again, anecdotal evidence) if I accellerate hard or soft. It's the simple matter of accellerating that consumes the fuel. If I maintain speed / cruise milage climbs immediately. "
"shipo","March 2008"," To be sure, for any given car, if you keep your foot out of it, it will deliver better fuel economy, however, some cars are still more adept at getting better mileage than others, and in this class of cars, the G35 seems to consistently deliver the worst fuel economy.Best Regards,Shipo "
"adamr001","March 2008"," Oh, I didn't say that it didn't. The G35 is more sports car than performance luxury sedan.It's just that I can make my G35 hit 20mpg in mixed driving or I can make it hit 17mpg. All by how I keep my foot on / off the pedal. On the highway, under cruise, I have no problems hitting 27mpg. Without cruise I run about 23mpg. To be sure, the G35 isn't a fuel efficient vehicle. "
"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," I think that all who look into this issue will unanimously agree that the G35 tends to get worse gas mileage than the TL -- by 2-3 mpg or so. One must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the G35 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it ""enough better"" to pay a little more for gas.I drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in Houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. For me, I liked the G35 at least that much more than the TL, so I don't mind paying the extra gas $$. Even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and I am still OK with that difference. If all else was equal and I liked the TL just as much as the G35, then I would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.Mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.Jeff "
"shipo","March 2008"," Yeah, well I guess my comments were colored by the fact that I often drive 800 in a single week (with 500 being typical). There is no doubt that if the montly mileage isn't huge, even gas for a Hummer won't be significant. ;-)Best Regards,Shipo "

"alltorque","March 2008"," I wonder if the choices/preferences posted here will change once you guys get the full range of Euro/Japanese diesels. Will the modern torquey oil-burners sway you away from your current picks, I wonder ? M-B, VW/Audi, BMW, Volvo etc have some excellent diesels. My favourite is possibly the Audi 4.2 V8 TDi as fitted to the Q7 SUV - 322bhp and 561lbft according the mag I'm looking at. Or you could have the VW 5.0 V10 from the Touareg @ 309bhp/554lbft but I'd still go for the 4.2.Would be interested in your views. "
"adamr001","March 2008"," Doubtful, for me at least. Diesel pumps are harder and harder to find in the city. Easy to find in small towns / on the highway, but hard in-town. When I had a Cummins I routinely had to travel 15-30 minutes out of my way to get fuel. Not keen on doing that again. "
"shipo","March 2008"," I'd buy a BMW or Audi diesel in a heartbeat. I've driven them in Europe and and entirely impressed, especially in their abilities to accelerate from say 20 mph to speeds of well over 100 mph. Forget the issue of fuel availability, if diesel cars start becoming popular (and I predict that they will), gasoline stations will increasingly start offering diesel as well. Case in point, of the three closest gas stations to our house, none of them carried diesel when we moved here in 2002, now they all do. Why? Well in our area, diesel trucks pickups and SUVs are quite popular as are VW TDIs and Mercedes-Benz E320 diesels.Best Regards.,Shipo "

"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Not shipo but I must say the 335d is very attractive to me. well, all diesels are. Gas here is $4 a gallon for premium. Diesel is about 20 cents more a gallon and the same station is a quarter of a mile from my house. If I can get 30 mpg with a diesel 335d v. 22 mpg with a 335, it's an easy call.$2100 a year for diesel and $2700 for premium. The diesel may cost more upfront but for me the idea of stopping less often is also really attractive. As prices go up, the savings will increase too. So if I'm looking at $5 a gallon in 2010 (seems reasonable to assume), my savings increase by hundreds. "
"shipo","March 2008"," Wifey and I have a combined million and a half or more miles, so yeah, she racks them up pretty quickly as well.

"plekto","March 2008"," I've come to the conclusion that the best car for the OP is actually none of the above.He wants something affordable and sporty and luxury, that's also reliable and gets good gas mileage. Unfortunately, they stopped making this car 2-3 years ago, but that's fine, because used like-new examples run about $20K.Get a Mercedes C230K Sedan with manual. This is the *4 door* sedan with the 1.8 supercharged engine in it. It was the exact same model that they sell in Europe(slightly larger engine) and is actually fairly reliable. Mercedes makes two types of cars. Cars and Taxis/Rentals. The way you can tel the difference is if it comes with stick-shift, since 90% of Germans get a license that allows them to drive manuals. If you are one of the 10% that gets an automatic-only license, you are literally laughed at and considered to be a child driver.Mercedes puts no effort into their fleet sales and models, and especially their automatic transmissions. Just enough to get by and no more(S class aside of course). This is why an E class, well, *is* a Taxi in 90% of the world. And it's why their SUVs suck. They are made for basically U.S. markets and taxis.(see a pattern? heh)In Europe, it's all about the A, B, and C class. Manuals are the norm and diesels are better. The closer Mercedes you buy to this sort of vehicle, the better it will drive and last.In Europe, it's called the C200 Kompressor and is a great car. Unfortunately, you have to go back to the previous generation in the U.S. to get that engine.Of course, the BEST Mercedes is this:C 220 CDI 4-cylinder 190 hp 460 NmIf we got this over here, it would obliterate the entry-level segment. 460Nm is an outrageous amount of torque, and 190HP is equal to the IS250. All while getting 30+ mpg.http://autocar-show.blogspot.com/2007/06/first-drive-experience-mercedes-c220.ht- mlBummer we can't get it here...****Now, if you're looking for automatic(sigh), get couple of year old IS300. This car has the IS250's looks and feel, yet is lighter and lots more powerful, plus it has a nice I-6 engine as well. It'll blow the doors off of a new IS250 or A4 in overall driving, and is somewhat useable in the rear for kids.Note - while the IS300 was good, it honestly reminded me exactly of the Volvo 850, but with RWD instead of FWD. It had a very ""European"" feel to it. Something abot the balance and suspension and size and all the rest - it felt better than the base 3 series.The Lexus messed up. they made a compromise version that's honestly not any better than the stuff GM puts out, and they put a mega-speed transmission and a V6 in the IS350 in a quest for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car.Remember, the original luxury performance sedan was... a BMW 2002. Light, agile, and well rounded are musts. Bloat, muscle-car power, and in search for a purpose... that's most modern cars.Or you can get a classic.  There's no shame in driving a classic car. "

During the 21 months that I serviced that client I put on just shy of 80,000 miles in spite of the fact that I was occasionally traveling and it sat in the garage.I'm now in the market for a new contract, and the two companies that seem to be the most likely candidates will have my mileage drop to a more normal 15,000 to 20,000 miles per year. Assuming one of those two actually happen, I'm thinking the 2009 Audi A3 (which will have the new ""clean-sheet design"" EA 888 engine), with a 6-Speed manual of course. The only rub with that car is that it is ""wrong wheel drive"", however, it does sport a spare tire well complete with a donut spare (but room for a full size wheel/tire), a jack, real GFTs, a dip-stick tube for checking/changing the oil, and room in the back to schlep around our new mutt.The flip side is that the company I was with for those 21 months is, A) talking of giving me another juicy contract, and  has moved their offices some 20 miles further (each way) from our home. If I end up back there, geez, I'm thinking either a new Honda Civic EX-L 6-Speed or a 2009 Jetta TDI 6-Speed, cars I can put 100,000 miles on in two years and not suffer too much from the depreciation.Best Regards,Shipo "

After that, I'm going to be in a far more flexible financial situation and will be able to afford a very expensive car if I want to go that way. So I'm considering the following options: leasing something for around $300 a month for 36 months, or buying something used but fairly nice in the the 12K-15K range, and then trading up three years from now. So far I've looked at the Acura TSX and the Audi 3 to lease, plus a five-year-old SAAB 9 to buy. Thanks in advance for any feedback! "
"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Buy used. A used TSX will run well, serve you nicely and in the end you'll have something, unlike a lease. "
"pcampos","March 2008"," I've noticed the TSXs don't seem to depreciate much at all in the first 2-3 years. I also understand that a redesigned model is coming out in a couple of months. So maybe I should be looking at something around five years old? It's tempting to lease, which I've never done, but since I'm a low mileage driver and am pretty easy on cars in general maybe it makes more sense to own something used for three years and hope it doesn't depreciate much in the interim.

"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," "". . .Acura TSX and the Audi 3. . .""Since I decided I could tolerate FWD this time around, I ended up looking at exactly those two cars. Since the RWD choices may improve over the next few years, I wanted something that wouldn't depreciate horribly over a 3-4 year period. I went with the TSX, and that'd probably be your best bet as well -- Audi depreciation is nothing to write home about. Going used, as has been suggested, is the only way to keep the payment as low as you want it.Honda depreciation is amazingly low; I'm shopping for a car for my mother-in-law, and Civic vs. Corolla used car prices have to be seen to be believed. A 1-2 year older Civic with 40-50K more miles sells for the same money as a newer much less used Corolla. Audi isn't even in the same ballpark.You'll enjoy either car, by the way. The TSX is working out nicely; it's meant to be an interim solution, but if I bond with it in a big way, I may still be driving it in 8 years, as I did my last car. I've driven rental A3s in Europe & really loved them. I did serious Audi research, going back seven years, as a result.Let us know how this turns out. "

It seems that you think that by taking a large FWD sled and then dropping in a big motor and slapping on some sticky rubber, it will suddenly be transformed into a ""Sports Sedan"". Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but the LaCrosse doesn't even come close to meeting the criteria as a Sports Sedan.If you don't believe me that the LaCrosse doesn't measure up, that's fine, consult the car comparison web site of your choice and look at the cars the ""experts"" think the Buick competes with.

I remembered the Viggen has 155mph top speed too and most 9-3 can go beyond 145mph (4 cyls turbo vs. Buick's...).A lot of cars have very high top speed but not all of them can be driven safety and stable at that speed.

The standard, normally aspirated engine is a little light on low-end torque, but it moves the car around smartly and provides slightly better mileage. The new twin-turbo engine provides the kind of acceleration formerly associated with the high-performance M3, launching the 335i coupe and sedan to 60 mph in close to 5 seconds flat. No matter which model you choose, the 3 Series' world-class suspension, steering and brakes will provide hours of entertainment on twisty two-lane highways. Beyond simply feeling rock-solid when hustled around turns, this car communicates with the driver in a manner that inspires confidence no matter what kind of driving you're doing. At the same time, the 3 Series is an ideal long-distance cruiser, delivering both a comfortably controlled ride and a quiet cabin environment.[unquote] That implies it could very well ""run away"" from an IS350 on the tracks.Link to the 335 review: http://www.edmunds.com/bmw/3series/2007/review.htmlLink to the IS350 review: http://www.edmunds.com/lexus/is350/2008/review.html "

And FWIW, Buick consistently ranks at the very top of JD Power and Consumer Reports quality and reliability surveys. Actually reminds me of the Honda Accord. Not directly, but the Accord is one of those cars that, while not a sports car, just feels right when you drive it. The controls, the feedback, the view, etc. It's just a car that feels good. Maybe the LaCrosse is like that? You've got to admit, it's nice to finally see an American car company making such great strides to improve quality and appeal. The LaCrosse and Enclave, the C6 Corvette and CTS, the G8, the Malibu - all nice cars with nice interiors, good looks, and solid performance and quality - they actually compete with imports on a level playing field.I won't buy an American car yet (the last burn still hurts), but in 5 years, at the rate they're going, maybe I'll have another look.Anyways, the majority has spoken and I think it's time for us to let the Buick thing rest.

"louiswei","March 2008"," Well, I installed the Eibach springs because I want the lower stance and better handling. I've got them for almost 2 months now and I am happy so far with the performance and the look. With the springs the body roll has been dramatically reduced, the artificial stiffness feel has been replace by a better (or should I say normal) stiffness feel and the steering response also improved slightly. Upon installation, the suspension actually felt softer than the stock setup but once it's settled down after couple weeks, that ""softness"" was gone. Kind of weird but other users have also reported about this.I've lowered the front by 1"" and rear by 0.8"". It's a mild drop.Here are some pictures with the Eibach springs: "

"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," Wow. Diesel in San Diego is $4.09 and premium is $3.79 near my house. For me, diesel is a savings compared to a normal bimmer (about $400 a year at current levels although gas will surely get more expensive).. "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," Well, for starters, when I use your numbers I come up with $5028 for the oil burner vs. the (almost) same number you got for the gas. However, I'd submit (as have others) that a $1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation, at least anywhere I'm likely to travel.Besides which, I neither need nor want a 335d. I'd buy a 2.0 or 2.5 tomorrow if they were available over here, and my experiences in the UK and Europe is that I'll get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those engines. Now, if we were to re-run the calculation with a $0.50 delta between the two fuels and 33% less consumption for the diesel, I think that will be a more useful number, at least to me.However, to support your point a bit, diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has. The trucks, locomotives, heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels (jet A for one) will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price, while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being transported. As we've already seen over the past few weeks, when gasoline prices go up significantly, people use less -- it's discretionary to a much larger extent.Should be interesting to see this play out. "

"shipo","March 2008"," As I understand it, when crude oil is refined, there are a number of different fuel grades that come from the distillates of various weights. In a typical barrel of crude oil the fuel grade distilled byproducts work out to the following rough percentages:1) Gasoline: 51%2) Fuel Oil (home heating oil and diesel): 15%3) Jet fuel (kerosene): 12%4) Still Gas (unrefined natural gas?): 5%A couple of points: - As I understand it, the above percentages cannot be varied by much. - As the demand for petroleum based diesel fuel rises, there will be a commensurate rise in the production of gasoline. - I've ""heard"" that one of the reasons (beyond taxes) that allows gasoline to be so inexpensive here in the States is because Europe consumes so much diesel. - As the demand for diesel fuel rises (as a percentage of fuel required for passenger cars) it stands to reason that the price of gasoline might actually drop.Please understand that I am no expert in this area and I'm just throwing the above factoids out there to generate some discussion.Best Regards,Shipo "

"sls002","March 2008"," It is possible to ""crack"" the oil and make the molecules into other products. Heavier into lighter (fuel oil into gasoline). Fuel (diesel and gasoline) can be made out of coal too, at a cost of about $45 per barrel. While not profitable when crude oil is less than $50 per barrel, it should now be very profitable.The point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products. In the winter more fuel oil (like diesel) is made. In the summer more gasoline is made. If the entire barrel were made into one product, it would be mostly synthetic (that is manufactured) rather than natural. Breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy. "
"alltorque","March 2008"," Apologies - case of ""I've seen it - ergo, so has everyone else"". I have now given myself a good talking to. :blush: It's on another Edmunds Forum : ""Diesels In The News"".

"shipo","March 2008"," ""Breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy.""What about the reverse? I know that gasoline for instance is a light distillate that is extracted from crude oil by simply heating said oil up to ~150 C. Once the gasoline is distilled out, half of every barrel is already gone. The heat is then increased to about ~200 C and kerosene is distilled out; increase the heat again to ~300 C and you get diesel oil, and yet again to ~370 C and you get home heating oil. Increase the heat beyond the ~400 C mark, you're extracting lubricants, paraffin and asphalt.So, are you suggesting that if the chemistry set is fancy enough, diesel can be made out of gasoline?Best Regards,Shipo "
"shipo","March 2008"," Thanks, I'll take a look. Best Regards,Shipo "
"circlew","March 2008"," So you are saying the demand is a factor over the grade of fuel produced. As demand goes up in the states for diesel consumption, Shipo's point is well taken that the price for gas would follow a lower demand/price. I think another factor is the efficiency and demand of the truck diesels which are a large percentage of the US domestic commerce. If public transport demands more diesel, the price will rise. Simple.I know the economy is there in Europe but it remains to be seen how the US model for diesel plays out. Interesting to say the least.Regards,OW "
"shipo","March 2008"," ""I know the economy is there in Europe but it remains to be seen how the US model for diesel plays out. Interesting to say the least.""As I understand it though, the European market (a market that uses similar amounts of diesel and gasoline) needs the American market to continue consuming gasoline so that their diesel prices stay relatively stable. If it is in fact true that more than three gallons of gasoline are produced for every gallon of diesel, then if the world suddenly switched to diesel cars, there'd instantly be a HUGE glut of gasoline on the world markets. Yes, no? :confuse: FWIW, I've long been a strong advocate of diesel engined cars, however, if it does turn out to be true that the percentages of what comes out of a barrel of crude are relatively fixed, I may be driving a gasoline engined car for quite some time (at least until methodologies are put in place for the production of mass quantities of bio-diesel).Best Regards,Shipo "
"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," As my buddy on Rowan & Martin used to say, Verrry Interesting. I was under the impression that the percentages among the four basic fuel groups could be skewed significantly, but perhaps not.If gasoline is the volatile byproduct of making the kerosine (Jet A) & diesel (heating oil) for which there are few substitutes. . .Maybe I'll be keeping my new gas motor longer than I thought, not that that's a bad thing.

"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," I've also noticed that the UK charges a bit more for diesel than gasoline, but that the better fuel mileage carries the day for the diesel. In Germany, last I was there, the diesel was noticeably less expensive. In Switzerland, not so much -- could have even been more, as in England.I still maintain that U.S. consumption of diesel fuel for cars isn't likely to drive price trends anytime soon, but that it certainly appears to be at the mercy of the rest of the world and the other fuel oil consumers in North America.

"sls002","March 2008"," Unfortunately the light crude oils where you could distill gasoline out in large quantities are mostly gone and the heavy crude oils that perdominate today are mostly asphalt (oh, perhaps not that bad :P ), but anyway cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easy.

This is the root of a major problem, the increasing heavy oil fraction of today's production. We don't have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage, for cracking the heavier oil fractions.

Yes, but that does little for the large number of existing set of refineries. "

This tuning is adjusted from winter to summer to increase gasoline or heating oil (basically diesel). "
"texases","March 2008"," My source is a refinery engineer with 25 years experience. To quote:""The current U.S. refining industry has only limited capability to generate more diesel versus gasoline in the short term.In fact, I personally believe the diesel market in the U.S. will not take off like it did in Europe for two reasons:1) Europe's rapid dieselization was heavily subsidized by preferential tax policies vs. gasoline. This type of aggressive social engineering is not as likely to occur in the U.S.2) Europe's dieselization was essentially ""costless"" in terms of refining capital expenditures, as European refiners simply cranked up their excess refining capacity to make more diesel and gasoline, selling the excess gasoline to the U.S.In fact, the U.S. imports roughly 1 Million Barrels of gasoline and gasoline components from Europe every day.In other words, Europe's dieselization was done on the back of the U.S.'s continued consumption of (relatively cheap) gasoline.If the U.S. were to ""dieselize"" in any significant manner, it would require 10's of Billions of Dollars in refining capital expenditures for process units such as Hydrocrackers to shift the product mix from 2/3 gasoline ~ 1/3 diesel to half & half gasoline and diesel.""All of this relates to your statement ""The point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products."" Can the mix be modified? Yes. Is it easily varied to create ""almost any combination of useful products""? I don't think so. "
"sls002","March 2008"," The key point being that I did in fact say ""a combination of useful products"", not a single product, such as all diesel or gasoline. The problem today, as reported on the Nightly Business Report, is that refineries are running at an abysmal 82% of capacity. I would hope that the reason for this is not to boost prices, but to switch over to making more summer fuels. "

""Finally, ditch the inline 6 for a twin turbo 4, and lose another 200-300 lbs. Ah, now you've got a fun sedan at 3100 lbs.""Oops, ya lost me there. Why? Well, several reasons actually:1) I'm a fan of smooth engines. The I6 that BMW uses is an engine type that is naturally in perfect balance, meanwhile, I4 engines are natural shakers with considerable second order (i.e. twice per revolution) vibrations. Granted, these vibrations can be counteracted with the use of balance shafts, however, said shafts add needless weight and complexity to the engine.2) like I said, I'm a fan of smooth engines, and in the world of four-stroke engines, unless an engine has at least five cylinders, it becomes a ""push-me-pull-you"" affair with the engine driving the flywheel and drive train during the power stroke of any one cylinder, and then the drivetrain and flywheel driving the engine between each power stroke. With BMWs I6 engine, not only do you get an engine that is in perfect mechanical balance, but you get one that is always supplying power to the flywheel and drivetrain.3) While I don't have the actual weights, I'm thinking that the composite metal blocked engine of the 3.0 liter engine in the E90 325i, 328i, and 330i is rather lighter than say Audi's iron blocked 2.0T. With the I6 engine design, all that is needed for vibration free engine is a block, a crank, and six piston/rod assemblies, With a high specific output blown I4, you typically have to cast the block out of lamellar graphite cast iron (GJL). Once you have the block, in addition to the crank and four piston/rod assemblies, you need to add two balance shafts (and the associated drive mechanisms), a turbocharger or two (and necessary plumbing and intercoolers and such), and a heavy flywheel that can help smooth out the torque reversals from the intermittent application of power.All-in-all, I'm thinking that I'd MUCH rather have a naturally aspirated I6 than a blown I4. ;-)Best Regards,Shipo "

"shipo","April 2008"," Well, whether you ""see"" it or not, it's the truth. Fact, I-6, H-6, V-12, and H-12 engines are naturally in balance for all free forces of both the first and second order, and free moments of the first and second order, and to the best of my knowledge are the only commonly built piston engines that are naturally in balance, and as such, naturally smooth.A discussion of the whys and hows of this balance issue is complex and long winded, and is way too over the top for the purposes of this forum.

Here are a few:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_balancehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_enginehttp://www.vibratesoftware.com/html_help/html/Diagnosis/engine_speed_related.htm- - Best Regards,Shipo "
"nyccarguy","April 2008"," I actually first walked away from the car last Sunday after initially looking at it because it was an Automatic. A few voices in my head (roadburner & fedlawman) told me I was crazy. I'm actually going to learn to perform the maintenience on the car myself. Once I get it running well, then I'll swap out the slushbox for a 5-speed.  "

"sls002","April 2008"," I looked over your references, and while wikipedia is a good source it is not always entirely correct. They commented that straight eight engines did not have OHV which is not correct as the Buick Straight Eight had OHV beginning in the 1930's. I see your point about the straight six, but I still think that a nicely balanced V8 may be smoother running. Most sixes are V6 designs and are not as good. "
"alltorque","April 2008"," It was drummed into me many years ago that the ""smoothest"", i.e. best naturally-balanced engines are 6's and 12's. 4's and 8's will always be less well naturally-balanced. No, can't explain why now but no doubt some of the pro engineers will be able to. Not sure about V6's as we didn't have many of those back in my day but we did have quite a few nice straight-6's; and they were very smooth if not terribly powerful by today's standards. "
"sls002","April 2008"," If you look at shipo's references and follow on with some of the other references you will find that the V6 needs counter balancing to run smoothly. With counter balancing the V8 is very smooth running. I think shipo's point was that the inline six without counter balancing is smooth running, while other engines require some sort of balancing.As I see it, the size of an inline six for any particular vehicle will be limited by how much space is given to the hood length. For the same hood length, a V-engine will take up less space and can therefore be larger than the inline six, for up to 12 cylinders. "
"fphjr01","April 2008"," I liked the comment about how ""an increase in boost pressure should bring the hp from 300 to 355"". This is interesting, considering that many of the available reviews on the 335's performance have indicated that the book 300hp claim is very likely low-balling the actual output.What a perfect idea -- make a 335 tii version, claim that there is 55 more hp than the standard engine (when it's actually exactly the same), and charge $5000 more for the 'modification'.

V engines are a design nightmare - angles and extra connecting rods and multiple camshafts and...That adds weight as well. And worsens efficiency. So as a result, you can make a smaller I-6 than a V6 and get the same results. So often, you can fit the I-6 in the car as well as a V6. But GM and Ford never really designed I-6 engines - at least not recently. So they trudge along with their overly complex V engines. BMW and Mercedes started out with inline engines and still use a lot of them.As for the weight, 3400lbs is just about what my 87 Buick Park Ave weighed. That's hideously bloated for such a small car.

That had a 2262cc I6 that pumped out a mind-blowing 59bhp, (but a fair bit of torque), and was coupled to a 3M 'box. First was so low that you could use it for pulling up tree stumps. Even that amount of power could embarass the cross-ply tyres of the day. All black body, lots of chrome and a carnation pink & white interior, (2 x 3 seat benches), plus valve radio.

"plekto","April 2008"," I meant more parts in the connecting rods. I see it as having pultiple connecting rods since it has more than one part between the piston and the crankshaft.*** from wiki on 60 degree engines***However, more modern designs often use a 3-throw crankshaft with what are termed flying arms between the crankpins, which not only give the required 120? separation but also can be used for balancing purposes. Combined with a pair of heavy counterweights on the crankshaft ends, these can eliminate all but a modest secondary imbalance which can easily be damped out by the engine mounts***So you don't have piston. rod. crankshaft. like in an inline engine. You have a bunch of intermediary parts kludged together to keep it from shaking itself apart.GM's 90 degree designs are even more complex and run even rougher, being designed off of V8 engines. Actually quite nasty, really. They tend to eat through engine mounts fairly regularly. The reason you don't see many I6s is because they usually won't fit in a FWD car due to there needing to be space for the CV joints and transmission as well. Thankfully it is making a comeback as makers are slowly realizing what a giant turd FWD technology is, especially in vehicles with over 200HP. "
"cdnpinhead","April 2008"," "". . .plus valve radio.""I also remember tube (valve) radios in cars -- they took awhile to warm up and really could run down the battery if left on while the engine (with its generator) was shut down. Lots of things have improved tremendously in automobiles over the past 50 years, but many of them add weight.My '65 MGB was lots of fun to drive & own, with the knock-offs, wire wheels, the tightest steering I've ever had and shifter feel that was unequalled. Safe? Not really. Powerful? No. Radio quality? Awful. Still, a wonderful car. "
"shipo","April 2008"," Ummm, I'm thinking that you've grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from Wikipedia. True, most V6 engines use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree engines that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some distance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline engine. FWIW, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they don't move independently and other than a little machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during engine assembly.Actually, when looked at from a part count perspective, V6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an I6. Why is that? Simple, your typical V6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical I6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. In spite of this difference, I6 engines usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a V6 of an otherwise similar design.Best Regards,Shipo "

"bfluegie","April 2008"," I&#146;m looking for a new (to me) ride. I don&#146;t have to decide just now, but probably sometime in the next couple of months. I thought I&#146;d post this here as well as on the &#147;help me decide&#148; forum because this seems to be a very active discussion. Some of the cars I am considering do fit this category, so it&#146;s not too much of a stretch. What I am considering is a (probably) pre-owned BMW 325xi (maybe a 330xi if the deal is right, but I&#146;m not too sure I want a turbo), G35x (I have VPP so I might go new for this), Audi A3 or A4 (I like the A3 better but they&#146;re hard to find in the northern IN vicinity), Acura TSX or maybe TL, but it&#146;s larger and I don&#146;t like it as much. I might consider the Altima coupe as well, but not the sedan. While I like the sedan styling more than the Accord or Camry, I don&#146;t like it as much as the Infinity, and the Altima sedans are everywhere. I don&#146;t want to put my car away for the winter, so I prefer all wheel or front wheel drive. That leaves out the Infinity G-coupe (sigh) and the BMW 3 series coupe. I know several people who drive the G coupe and they either garage it for the winter or get adequate but not great driving with winter tires. I prefer the security of good winter handling. I haven&#146;t completely ruled out a small SUV or crossover, but after 8 years of driving an Exploder I&#146;m ready for a more responsive ride. I joke about the Explorer, but with the exception of an unfortunate &#147;Bambi&#148; incident I have never been left stranded. No significant repairs other than normal wear and tear either. It just has over 130K miles and it is time to move on to something else. As long as I&#146;m moving on, I want to add some fun. I won&#146;t be racing or pushing for maximum speed, but I do like the feel of a car that you don&#146;t have to slow to a crawl when going around a curve. I suppose I want to feel like I am part of a driving system rather than the occupant of a vehicle. I would consider a 2006-2007, maybe a 2005 as well. I know the Infinity was a new model in 2007 but I like the previous model as well. The BMW was a new model in 2006 and I don&#146;t know anything about the 2005. I might be overlooking something else as well, so any suggestions for additional cars to consider (or avoid) are welcome. I&#146;m considering a manual in the BMW or A4 but I didn&#146;t like the manual in the &#145;07 TL I drove (the clutch seemed to have a very tiny &#147;sweet spot&#148; and it didn&#146;t help that the salesperson sneered a little when I lurched on a start). I don&#146;t know if the TSX would be any better. The G35X is only available in an auto. Manual vs. auto isn&#146;t a big factor for me so I probably wouldn&#146;t rule out an auto BMW or Audi either. Since I&#146;m going to continue getting older and creakier, the auto might be a smarter choice, just not as much fun in the pre-creaky years. "
"ivan_99","April 2008"," You have a wide range of requirements...but you didn't clarify the price range you're looking for or any requirement for seating/space.I'm also assuming you're looking at purchasing as opposed to leasingFor coupes...If you don't need back seat room very often a TT would be a nice ""cool"" coupe to have (2.0T FWD). A new Accord Coupe with the I4 5spd would be very economical but look a little different than everything else. I'm a big fan of the A5 (S-line)...especially the S5 (love the torque...gets pricey)...A5 with FWD and manual (s-line) starts in the low 40's.

S80 is well worth a look.Saab's are rated a bit so-so here in U.K. but are premium priced. Audi good in whatever size. A6 is about S80 size.Can't comment on the others, apart from VW, but the current ones are good. "
"bfluegie","April 2008"," Thanks for the input Ivan. While I have not ruled out domestic, I haven't found the blend of performance, features, and solid feel in many domestic cars. Pricewise, I'm trying to stay in the mid 30s or lower. While I could afford more, that's where the comfort zone starts to end and the panic zone begins. The A5 could get me to make an exception, though. Seeing that beauty in my garage every morning could calm a lot of panic.I hadn't considered the Jetta Fahrenheit and I will have to check it out. I have driven the DSG, though in an A3 Quattro. I really liked that car. I forgot the A4 was heading for a redesign. I'll have to check that out as well. The current CTS looks sharp and I can get the supplier discount (below invoice) so I might look there as well. Thank you for some very good suggestions. "

"markcincinnati","April 2008"," Why pay $5,300 MORE for a car that has a heavier front end, takes more gasoline to propel it and has 15 ft lbs less torque -- and that the torque it does have comes on at thousands of rpm's higher?I had an allroad 2.7T and I had also had three Audi cars with the 4.2 V8 (one A8 and two A6's) -- so when it came time to order the allroad, I test drove another sort of similar car, an A6 2.7T. Torque rules.And in the example above, the V8 had 295 ft pounds of torque vs the V6's 258 ft pounds, yet the V6 was quicker because the torque came on (in the V6) at below 2,000 RPMs and the V8 didn't come up to full boil until north of 3500 RPMs.In this case, the new 2.0TFSI has 258 ft pounds, below 2000 rpms and the 3.2FSI has 243 at north of 3200 rpms -- this is a no brainer.The V6 IMHO is for the consumer who wants to talk about the 265HP V6 (despite its lower torque.)Had Audi offered the engine competing with the BMW 335 i6 turbo, well, that might have been a horse(power) of a different color.I believe the A4 2.0T will be the car of choice for about 10-12 months in the A4 family; the V6 being offered solely for marketing reasons (""wouldn't do,"" to have this car without a V6 in the brochure, kind of thing.)I may, but I doubt it, regret this decision. But the handling, mileage and performance of the 2.0TFSI should be superior in Cincinnati OH (where it will see most of its duty.) It will easily top any speed limit we have in these parts (just as easily as the V6) and its quickness, for a while at least, will be unequaled -- at least until the supercharged V6 comes out in a year or so.Another A6 3.2 certainly was an option -- but the new A4 will have a 110+"" wheel base, the A6 is 111+"" -- the balance, RWD biased quattro, sport package and other amenities and luxuries in the premium plus package makes the A4 2.0TFSI a ""better"" choice for someone who wants CTS style luxury (at least) and very BMW like performance and handling -- in a handsome package.Rationalization?Perhaps -- but there are just too many head to head (A4 vs A6) test reports and reviews of this new A4 to make me wonder ""who in their right mind would pay MORE for less?"" -- and that seems to make the case in favor of the A4 (B8) 2.0T with ""all the option boxes ticked off -- except ACC.""So, we'll see how much under $50K this comes out to be -- and hopefully I will not regret not going with my second choice: the new Infiniti G37X 4 door sedan.FWIW, my dealer says this car should be comparable in MSRP to the outgoing model + about $2,000 for the Audi Drive Select and a ""few hundred"" more for the addition of a backup camera.Time will tell -- and I WILL share the good, the bad and the expensive with y'all. :surprise: "

It handles really well, though it will understeer on you when you start pushing the limit. And the steering's not quite as quick as I like. The Sport package is much better as far as handling's concerned. I haven't driven a 3-series Sport long enough to really test the steering.Here's a strange one for you. I test drove an M3 sedan and it's suspension actually felt softer than my 550i Sport! :surprise: (It didn't have the adjustable suspension.) Go figure! But boy was it precise in direction. And getting back in my 550i after the M3, I could really feel the heft of the 5-series over the 3-series. (Or 550i Sport over the M3, that is.) "
"plekto","May 2008"," Check out the weight of one. Close to 2 tons. The reason it's quiet is because they have added several hundred pounds of materials to dampen it like a Buick or a Mercedes.Handling is nowhere as good as the 3 series a decade ago as a result of being 700lbs or so heavier. "
"tayl0rd","May 2008"," There aren't ""several hundred pounds"" of sound dampening material. The vast majority of the weight comes from safety equipment, amenties, and chassis stiffening/bracing. "
"sls002","May 2008"," The increase in weight is due to the body's larger size (#1) and stiffer structure (#2). The new 1-series is a return to a smaller body, but they are using the 3 series platform so it has the same weight problem. "
"plekto","May 2008"," ""stiffer structure"" means more metal and dampening materials. The safety equipment between 1998 and 2008 isn't actually that different. Maybe 100lbs more, if that, since the older models came pretty much with everything that was available at the time. "

"blueguydotcom","June 2008"," Depends on the buyer. If you're buying for luxury the IS250 seems like the ticket (and that ticket is very expensive). If you want space for people, utility, power (it's got gobs more than the IS250) and still a small package, then the A3's golden (and priced nicely). Personally, I detested the IS (even the 350) and find the A3 allows us to do everything - pick up passengers, go on a run to home depot for larger items, smooth, effortless power. The handling's not as sharp as I would like and there's road noise from the cruddy all-season tires. Gas mileage, when I drive it, tends to be in the mid to high 20s. Outside of the RWD layout, which Lexus numbed down to the point that the car understeers like a FWD, I can't personally see the value in the far more expensive, less powerful, less useful IS250. "
"jzalkin","June 2008"," I owned an A4 Cab (sold at 56,00 miles) and now have the IS250 (36,500 miles). Here are my thoughts.Quality is a lot better in the Lexus. Forget the big items as the small stuff makes for greater frustration. I always had a few things in the Audi that needed to get addressed every service (broken small pieces, peeling of plastic coating, etc), but not with the Lexus. The Lexus is put together great. I know why they have loyalty because there are so few complaints on the small annoying things as the car ages. I guess that is why there are a lot of last gen Lexus driving around that people love. Service varies, but around South Florida, the Lexus experience is top shelf (better than Audi). I almost never have a list of little things to be addressed at the service intervals.The Audi feels sportier and has a roughness that reinforces that. The Lexus is serene and the quietness/plushness reinforces that. Both get old at times, but you have to decide your preference. I can't compare engines as my A4 Cab was heavy and did not perform any better than the IS250. I get great gas mileage and do not want any more HP in my car given fuel prices. With prices expected to hit $4.50 by end of July (premium - see record oil prices today and stock market plunge) I wouldn't mind giving up even more hp for even better gas mileage. The A3 is more versatile, but can't touch the Lexus for overall Luxury. Plus, the Lexus V6 is smooth and does have plenty of umph when needed. I loved the audi and await the A5 convertible, but unless you carry a lot of things that you need the A3 for space - I think the Lexus is the better choice. I was not inclined to keep the Audi out of warranty, but will not hesitate to keep the Lexus based on my personal experience. "

The A8 has around 60k miles and has only suffered one glitch - two weeks ago the Audi satnav decided to stop working for 10 minutes whilst driving around the Paris Peripherique, (great place to lose satnav), but came back of its own accord. The RS4 is only 6 months old and no hiccups but same friend also has a Ferrari F355 which seems to go wrong on just about every trip...............to the extent that he's gonna sell it as he thinks the RS4 is a far better-built car, damn near as fast, far more useable and it doesn't attract the wrong sort of attention from the boy-racers or constabulary, (we have a couple of Subaru Imprezza WRX police cars locally which do send out a certain Clint Eatwood-esque message.

"shipo","June 2008"," I've driven all three, and in spite of the fact that I value RWD over any other drivetrain, I'd rank the cars as follows:1 - Audi A3 2.0T 6-Speed -- By far the most enjoyable the three to drive, and has the most rear seat space and the most utility as well given the mini-station wagon configuration.2 - Acura TSX 6-Speed -- Fun to drive, lots of goodies (that I don't necessarily care about), and reasonable space in the back seat.3 - Lexus IS250 RWD 6-Speed -- Extremely boring to drive with no ""feel"" of what's going on with the mechanicals or down on the road. This car also suffers from an anemic engine (at least until you wind it up even higher than the Acura's already high strung mill) and a back seat that is all but laughable. In every respect, this car is a very distant third of the three.Best Regards,Shipo "
"darrinzramz","June 2008"," Hi need some answers if possible,I have a G35 sedan 2004,I've been using 87 octane in my car w/no problems at all.Seems to me when gas gauge reads full,I watch the gas gauge over the course of the week,and I notice it stays up near-full for the 1st 85-100 miles I put on the car,then all of the sudden the gas gauge seems to go down quite quickly from there.I'm medium on the gas on occasion I will get on it medium to slightly hard,it seems I'm only getting 15.6mi/gal,does that seem a bit much or not!!!????.Anyways I've change the plugs to a performance plug also I installed a K&N filter,there is no gas leaks what so ever!!!,any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,I also do use my cruise contol also,do mostly city driving though, not alot of stop and go,thanks Darrin Lynch  "
"shipo","June 2008"," A few points:1) Over the decades I've had dozens of cars that were from Asia, North America and Europe, and every one of them has exhibited the same gas gauge characteristics as your car (i.e. the needle is fairly stable for say 100 miles following a fill-up, and then it drops like a rock). This is totally normal as the level of fuel when ""full"" is typically above the top measurement range of the gauge sensor.2) IIRC, Infiniti recommends ""Premium"" gasoline for your 2004 G35 engine (an engine well known for its poor fuel economy by the way), you should check your Owners Manual to be sure. Assuming that's the case, by running regular you are forcing the engine management system to retard the ignition timing to keep the engine from blowing itself to bits because of the low grade fuel you're feeding it. In turn, retarded ignition timing will further reduce the already marginal fuel economy of your engine.3) Given how modern engine management systems work, it is physically impossible for a K&N filter to improve fuel economy. In fact, there is a fair amount of empirical evidence that suggests this type of a filter can reduce your economy.4) Based upon the reports of other owners of your car, 15.6 mpg is not too far out of line for ""mostly city driving"".Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Best Regards,Shipo "
"ghstudio","June 2008"," The nissan/infiniti engine is one of the really solid engines...it's still the base for the current nissan/infiniti engines. It is not the most thrify on gas, neither is it the worst. It is possible that not using high test is effecting your mileage, but I've tried 93 octane and 87 octane in my 06 M35 and I've seen no difference in MPG or pep. A larger factor is ethanol in your gasoline (unavoidable today) which gives you less mpg then 100% gasoline. I doubt that octane is causing any problem in this engine however you can try three tanks of high test and see if you see any significant difference.Fuel guage is what it is...I think it was the old BMW where they made the guage for the last 1/4 tank of gas almost 3/4 of the guage. It's rare that it matters how full the tank is when it shows full...but it really does matter when you're down to 1/8 a tank.High performance plugs and ""high efficiency"" air cleaners do almost nothing in a modern engine. Actually, most all additives also do nothing, in fact most car makers recommend against using ANY additives in the car. If you aren't driving aggressively, then about the only thing you can do that will really improve mileage is to turn off the A/C. "
"circlew","June 2008"," I have the BMW 330xi and have religiously used premium gas as spec. I get consistent 22 mpg tank to tank. Why you would use low octane on a higher performance engine is foreign to me. My car weighs 3,700 lbs and still gets acceptable gas mileage on standard A/S tires because each month I regulate tire pressure and rotate the tires each 5K miles.Tires last longer, wear even and get the best efficiency as a result.It doesn't take much to get the specified MPG rating for your car if you are aware of the small details.Regards,OW "
"1nickatnite1","June 2008"," I don't know about 04 g35s but with the current ones you cannot rotate the tires. 15.6 mpg does sound low but if it is mostly city driving and since you admit to driving with a ""medium to heavy"" foot it is not that surprising. Best gadget I've heard of for saving gas is the fuel ""mizer?"" (sorry not sure about the spelling) supposedly it will change your driving habits and increase your mileage up to 20%, hope this helps.

In so many ways it is still ahead, by years, of the newest CTS -- if you could test drive these two cars back to back, the content and performance of the C6/A6 vs the CTS demonstrates this point.

Best seats in the business, nice lines, very well built and typically excellent Swedish safety, (incl child seats). Between the S60 and an A6 would be a hard choice for me but the slightly more distinctive lines of the Volvo would probably win me over - again - after 2 years of enjoyable, comfortable, utterly reliable driving. $22k would buy you an '07 or possibly '08 S60 SE Lux here in U.K. and enough change for a good weekend away...........ditto for an S80 which is even nicer.Ah, but the iPod plug-in would be an after-market fit; but hardly a deal breaker.

"markcincinnati","July 2009"," If you can get your choice of one of the cars on your list with the CPO designation -- from the factory -- I would urge you to consider doing so, as the cars on your list are breathtakingly expensive to repair without some kind of a warranty program.I traded in my 2005 Audi A6 (fully loaded and with the V6) and it had 60k virtually trouble free miles on it. Having said that, I would ONLY acquire one (of any of these mfgr's kids) with the CPO designation.PS don't think you will use snow tires on an RWD car and enjoy it as much as an AWD car with all seasons, in most places, that is.

"bastuk","January 2010"," I posted a similar post in the Luxury Performance forum but this is probably more fitting. And it's related to the recent posts by ""dash5"" on entry level luxury cars. I've been driving a '01 Accord EX-V6 for the past 8 years - it's been a great car - the only things I have done are the std maintenance items - brakes, tires, etc. I am starting to shop for ""newer"" used car with less miles as I have 151K miles on it. I am looking at moving up into a more luxury class - looking at Audi A4/A6, BMW 3 or 5 class or Acura TL. Today, I had a chance to drive all of these and in addition a MB. The dealer had a 04 Mercedes E320 and it was awesome to drive and seemed priced ok ($17K).As I have been doing research I continue to find the biggest complaints against the German cars being reliability and the high cost of repairs. Honestly, after reading the articles and reviews, I am reconsidering ""moving up"" and thinking about buying a newer Accord or just moving into the Acura class.A couple of questions -+ Are the repair costs significantly higher with a German car vs Japanese? I have no baseline on my Accord since I have not had to do any repairs.+ Is the reliability that much worse for the German cars than an Acura/Honda? "

Here are the current running costs on my four cars that are used on a regular basis:2007 Mazdaspeed 3- 4.4 cents per mile over 52,000 miles2004 BMW X3 2.5- 2.8 cents per mile over 86,000 miles1999 Jeep Wrangler TJ- 5.2 cents per mile over 58800 miles1995 BMW 318ti- 5.4 cents per mile over 120,000 milesIn 86,000 miles the X3 has needed one warranty repair- a passenger SRS sensor. Aside from that it has needed one set of brakes at 60,000 miles and tires at 46,000. The Inspection II(major) service and a brake fluid flush at 65,000 miles cost less than $370.The 318ti is my part-time track rat(note that its running costs include four sets of track rubber). In the 15 years I've owned it it's needed two sets of front pads and one set of rear pads along with four rotors. I've also replaced the drive belts and idler pulleys, the brake light switch, battery and the thermostat, all of which costs less than $550. My last Inspection II cost $495, and that number included a coolant flush and a four wheel alignment. In contrast, my Mazda has needed major mechanical and suspension repairs- it will soon be replaced with either an M3 or M5. "
"plekto","January 2010"," The problem stems from the suppliers for electronics in Europe that German companies use. With their insane taxes, they are pretty much forced to use Bosch and a few other makers for their switches and electrical components in the vehicle to keep costs down(Porsche doesn't but they also charge the difference and then some).Conversely, most of the better stuff in the world comes from Korea and Japan, so the components that cause the repairs don't fall fail half as often. The trick, of course, is to get a Japanese or Korean made vehicle that isn't full of Chinese and Malaysian and wherever else labor is cheap electrical and mechanical parts. "

Toyota isn't there and neither are any of the European brands.(or Cadillac) edit:If you go back to 2006, Toyota is on the list.

But to calculate the costs, one has to assume, either all third party maintenance or all dealer maintenance...except for BMWs.My assertion is after the B2B an Infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a Lexus water pump as a BMW water pump...or at least close enough for government work. "
"jimbres","February 2010","  My assertion is after the B2B an Infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a Lexus water pump as a BMW water pump...or at least close enough for government work. Agreed. This has been my experience with my BMW, which has been out of warranty since the middle of 2005. Here again, our independent mechanic provides the labor, & his rates are obviously the same whether he's working on the BMW or the Lexus.I think that people who say that Japanese luxury cars are cheaper to maintain than their German counterparts have something else in mind -- namely, that the German car is likely to require expensive repairs sooner (earlier in the car's life) & possibly more often than the Japanese car. So while it may be true that the cost of replacing part X is pretty much the same for a BMW as it is for an Infiniti, this part typically lasts for 125K miles on the Infiniti but usually fails at the 90K mark on BMWs. "
"plekto","February 2010"," True. And the electronics are more pricey on the BMW, Audi, and Mercedes as well, which are usually what goes bad first. For some reason, the German electronics firms just make second-rate junk, but they don't change to more reliable Asian suppliers. Actually I suspect the real reason is politics and taxes.I do know that when I owned a Mercedes a few years ago(and a couple of Volvos back before Ford ruined them), they cost significantly more for the parts and often there was no aftermarket replacement for switches, accessories, and computer modules. I think what finally did it for me was when it cost me nearly $30 for a factory shift knob replacement for my Volvo. (don't get me started on stuff like keys)The raw data suggests the following arrangement::1:Infiniti2:Lexus(Toyota is now almost as expensive for parts as Volvo, unfortunately. Their transmissions are a known hugely expensive problem as well)3:4:Cadillac/Acura (they tend to switch back and forth - Acura breaks less often, Cadillac costs less to fix - nearly a tie as a result)5:6:7:8:(all the rest start here)There's a tiny gap between Lexus and Infiniti, then a small one to Cadillac(major improvement in the last decade) and Acura, and then a large drop down to the rest. I think what does it is that it's really Nissan, Toyota, and Honda versus the rest. In Japan, there is only one product line - and the premium models are just that - the upper end models of the normal line. "

I certainly, and this is me, would not get an Infiniti thinking it would be cheap to own after the warranty expires. But neither a Lexus or BMW either. How about true cost to own on Edmunds, what do they say? Frankly I'm not looking it up, because your assertions don't pass the wet finger in the air test.edit: I checked TCO. Try it..it contradicts your assertions and is line with some common sense. BMW 328X, Lexus 350, G37X are all within a few bucks of one another. BMW 335iX is $10 grand more...of course the 335 leaves the others in the dust in both performance and TCO. Camry 4c more than $20 grand less. "

But I don't particularly like Mercedes & having owned one Audi, which was nothing short of horrific, I'll probably never buy another.It's much more likely that the final decision will come down to a BMW 335i versus an Infiniti G. And the price gap between the 2 cars is so great that the amount of money that ""Ultimate Service"" would save me - $649.40 over 4 years according to BMW's web site - is just laughably trivial.That doesn't mean that I might not buy another BMW, but it does mean that ""Ultimate Service"" won't be a factor in my thinking.

"tlong","February 2010"," One only worries about depreciation if one is going to sell almost immediately. It is not a financially good decision to buy a car with selling it in three years in the back of your mind. If you are going to do that leasing is available. This is a silly argument we are having. Even if you drive a car for 10 years, if it cost $45K new and $5k in 10 years = $40K = $4k/year in depreciation.If you buy a new Camry for $30K and it costs $3K in 10 years = $27K = $2.7K/year.So the ELLPS is $1.3K/year more expensive due to depreciation. Which is why I'm saying that maintenance should not be a big factor. You would have to average $1300/year MORE in maintenance costs on the Camry PER YEAR to equal the much larger cost of the ELLPS purchase. So the ELLPS is a lot more expensive to own. And that is why even a grand or two every few years in maintenance costs is not that big. It has nothing to do with how long you keep the vehicle. Maintenance is not a large part of the ownership costs. And I haven't even brought up the costs for insurance, etc.So if you like an ELLPS and you can afford it, buy or lease it and don't worry about the maintenance costs, or perhaps you can't afford the vehicle in the first place. If you want a real worry, then the relative risk of breaking down or of time in the shop is probably more important, since that is a convenience issue rather than a cost issue. "
"plekto","February 2010"," TCO has a huge problem with it.1: Depreciation isn't a factor in comparing cost to fix/repair/upkeep a vehicle. Also, neither is stuff like insurance. Yes, it matters, but not to compare which vehicles are the least expensive to keep running(you really only lose money when you sell the car, if you ever do - or to be more accurate, you only GET BACK the difference in depreciation when/if you sell it)2: The first years where the factory warranty is in place artificially skew the results. BMW comes out well by this measure because it does cost you nothing to keep the car running, or nearly so. But try that with a 5 year old BMW...TCO is pretty worthless, really.Just looking at the data I posted - if you go back to 2005, you'll see Lexus is taking about half of the spots. Infiniti and Cadillac vastly improved their quality since then and Lexus slipped a bit down to where Honda/Acura is.(still very good, especially if you get a car with manual)link titleThe problem is that costs to fix things is skyrocketing. A replacement transmission in a Camry, for instance, runs over $3500 now. That's just silly. Bumpers and other components that get scuffed or cracked are hideously expensive. Want to replace a Toyota or BMW or well, almost ANY car's headlight assembly? So if one company can come in with less frequency and/or less cost per part than the competition, it wins. Mercedes, Audi, and BMW flat-out fail here. Volvo is also notoriously pricey to fix. Acura and Infiniti are a bit better, as is Cadillac(they take grief about not using the best newest tech, but then again, that's less stuff to break as well) Toyota just has problems recently and I'd not recommend anything with an automatic or ETC(electronic throttle control) on it from them.(that's 80%+ of their line currently.

"kdshapiro","February 2010"," There's that expression again, lies, damn lies and statistics. You get to pick your metric and make your case based on your metric. There is no getting around it, the more expensive the car the more it costs to own.For example: In my area a rebuilt G35 tranny is almost $2K, but a rebuilt Camry tranny is $700. Not sure where you get your figures from. A headlight assembly for a G37 is nearly $800. Ouch.If you are saying an Infiniti tranny breaks less often than a Camry tranny after the warranty period, you would have to point to some credible source for me to believe it. Not just a CR survey.But it still boils down to will *your* car have an issue, and if it does what will it take to repair it. My BMW can be cheaper to own on a parts basis against a used Accord if nothing breaks on it and the Accord is constantly under repair. "
"plekto","February 2010"," I suppose if the rebuilt Camry transmission is a generation or two old and has no warranty and is out of some shop in the middle of the industrial section of town, you MIGHT find one for $700. But here in Los Angeles, a 4-5 year old Camry automatic is well over $3000 by the time you write the final check. The best I could find locally was $2100 with a warranty, not counting labor, shipping, tax(etc) and a core charge. The CTS transmission was only $1600. Now $500 might not be a huge amount to some people, but that's more than I spent last year on maintainance on my 4x4.With that sort of potential repair and the issues that keep coming up(plus the new Prius recall, now!) I can't recommend Toyota other than for their trucks. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010","  Who buys a new transmission? Almost nobody? It must be a regional thing. The numbers I cited were local. It must be a supply and demand issue in the LA area, which is a very narrow slice of information to make a broad generalization on.The other potential reason for the difference is that CTS trannies may be crap, you get what you pay for.I have no problems with Toyota, I would buy any of their cars in a heartbeat, recalls or not, doesn't bother me in the least.

"smarty666","February 2010"," I find this discussion about maintenance costs very interesting since I have a Infiniti, Acura, and MB. Its hard for me to add anything really important or helpful to discussion since in the 6 years I have had each car I haven't had anything but normal maintenance stuff done to each vehicle and no other problems as of yet; in regards to normal maintenance the Infiniti has been the most expensive to maintain because the gas mileage is lower than my Acura or MB and plus it has a larger tank than the other two! air and cabin filters were the cheapest in my Acura to replaceoverall, I think my Acura has been the cheapest to maintain but don't get me wrong, both the Infiniti and MB are not that much more expensive and I've been pretty happy at the amount each one has been to maintain!!! "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Pick your metric to prove your point. TCO for a ""generic"" Infiniti G3X is much more than a ""generic"" Camry. BTW I call Intellichoice a rag, which is why I do not believe their metrics. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," It's an interesting discussion but what is being discussed has to be clear. As gbrozen stated above maintenance is not repair. You may be of the ilk who likes to change their oil once a month even if you put on 12K miles a year, thus driving maintenance costs up.I am talking about repair, which is after the warranty expires. How much does it cost to get brakes replaced, altenator, transmission, water pump, ECU, light assembly, sunroof etc. A Lexus, BMW, Acura, Infiniti, Audi will have a higher repair bill than a Camry and Honda. This assumes you go to the dealer for service.As long as nothing goes wrong with the car after the warranty expires, oil changes are cheap. The major services run into some money. A friend paid $275 dollars for his 7500 mile service on his Acura. Sure he could have gone to Jiffy Lube and saved a few bucks, but he wanted the dealer experience.A BMW is the cheapest car to maintain because it costs you $0 for four years, but what happens after four years? "

"alltorque","February 2010"," Interesting post. Which of the vehicles is the best made? I do not own a German car, but I have always thought that Mercedes was the best built, structurally, of any luxury car.I doubt that MB are even in the top 5 of the ""Any Luxury Car"" category, although they would have you think so. Rolls Royce, Bentley, Bugatti, Maybach are surely top of the heap and then there is a whole slew of builders who would tie for the next places. MB would have the ""S"" class in there but not much else in the past 5-10 years. Here in UK they rate pretty poor in JD Power surveys. Lexus always beats 'em - as do Skoda, and that's a VW cheapo-brand, (although it also beats VW and Audi every time).Then, of course, Maybach is to MB as Lexus is to Toyota. "
"plekto","February 2010"," It's odd, really. Mercedes make the best engines and bodies and car that I know of, but the accessories and automatic transmissions are among the worst. The only way to buy one, then, is manual everything and no options at all and with a manual transmission. They sell these in Europe but not in the U.S.(barring gems like the C230K they made a few years ago)The best built for cars is actually a near tie between Nissan, Mazda, and Honda. Honda gets the 3# place(by maybe a foot behind the others) if only because their prices on parts have gone up in the last few years.For trucks and SUVs, Nissan and Toyota if you get one with a manual transmission, that is.

"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Best built cars are Porsche. Owners never take repair tools to rallyes.With the exception of the a Camry is more expensive to own than a G37, debating who makes the more bulletproof car is like debating vanilla vs chocolate.

"roadburner","February 2010"," fedlawman;I might be buying a 54K mile E30 M3. I'm just trying to decide if I should use it as my daily driver. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," That's a tough one. One the one hand, what a shame to ""use up"" such a low mileage example just commuting to and from work. On the other hand, these cars are not exotic collector cars and they're meant to be driven. There are lots of factory and aftermarket parts out there to keep it on the road indefinitely, so as it ages and wears, you'll never have trouble keeping it in tip top shape. As long as you don't mind the thought of watching it get old and used up, I think it's fine as a DDer. It's funny, I know a couple of people who own E30 garage queens and can't help feeling some resentment towards them because I think it's such a waste, but I also know that if I owned one of those E30's, I'd probably be inclined to ""preserve"" it too. Maybe that's why my 210,000 mile restored M3 is right for me. It looks and runs great, but on close inspection, it will never be mistaken for a show car.Also, I guess I should to admit to you that I don't think I could drive mine every day. I love driving my M3 on the weekends and during the summer, I do drive it to work occasionally just because it's just such a joy on a nice day. Oftentimes though, I'm grateful I have a 4-door slushbox company car for my commute - especially during the winter months. A smooth, quiet ride, with cupholders and an automatic transmission is usually what I want when the weather is gloomy, I'm tired, and I just want to get where I'm going without any drama.Honestly, I wish I had kept my E30 325is when I got my M3. Having both would have been perfect - the 325 is a much better DDer, still a lot of fun to drive, fun to tinker on, and parts are cheaper. It doesn't have to be another E30, but if you can do it, buy the M3 for when you want to drive, but have something else for when you have to drive.EDIT: I guess I didn't really answer your question, did I? Sorry, I'm tired and honestly, I go back and forth about my M3 lately. There's nothing else like it and I love it, but sometimes when the rear speakers stop working, the interior lights fail, or a dashboard panel comes loose, I secretly think to myself that a Cayman S would be so much easier to live with. But that's crazy talk...very few cars are more fun to drive, and none of them have a back seat and trunk. It's really a very special, fantastic car - arguably the best BMW has ever produced. If I ever do part with mine, I'll be forever grateful that I had the privilege and pleasure of owning and driving one. "

"temj12","February 2010"," What is the problem with the transmissions? Is it that they don't last or the performance? Is the accessories problem part of the electrical problems that I see mentioned? I have always thought that I would like to have one at some time, but I know the repairs are very expensive. In Europe, they are a fairly common car. Here, they are luxury. "
"plekto","February 2010"," Automatic transmissions live and die based upon their electronics and hydraulic components. Often when the system fails, the oil overheats and cooks the inside or damages something and the entire thing turns into a brick that needs to be completely pulled apart and rebuilt. As, say, opposed to an old hydraulic only design like Ford and GM used to make a decade or two ago - just replace the torque converter 90% of the time for cheap and you're done.($800-$1200 repair vs a whole new unit)Mercedes makes its cars in Europe with manuals only, essentially. They add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. As a result, it's almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds - just put something in and ship it out the door, who cares as it's not going to someone who cares or can't afford the maintainance. They don't re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a Chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it(trust me - the designs are still very similar on the automatics).The only way to avoid this is to buy a manual like 80%+ of Europe does. The problem is, of course, that almost nothing shipped TO the U.S. by Mercedes(or most other makers other than VW) is offered with a manual. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," At some point in time for three seconds it might have been true. Clearly Mercedes lost it's focus for a while, but they have been working to get it back. So I say the above statement holds no water as a generality.One could do a search on Infiniti transmission problems and find some stuff. "

Well, I'd still have my 318ti Club Sport as well as my 2002A. I also don't really have a daily commute; my annual mileage depends on how many out of county assignments I receive. And when all's said and done, I don't recall the M3 being any less civilized than my Mazdaspeed...The thing is, I keep reading about how you should get an E30 M3 while they're still relatively cheap- and then there's the incomparable racing heritage. I guess the hook was set back in 1989, when I spent a day lapping Sears Point(Infineon) in a friend's 1989 M3. At any rate, I don't have to decide right away, but I will need to make a call sooner than later. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," I've never actually driven a stock, low mileage E30 M3. Mine's somewhat modified, as you know, so it's not nearly as quiet and comfortable as I imagine a stock M3 must be. Even so, the S14 has never been described as refined, and even a stock M3 is gonna rattle, buzz, and vibrate all over. I swear, sometimes I think the car is trying to shake itself to pieces. The solution, of course, is to keep the revs above 5000 - my car just sings between 5K and 8K.The right time to buy is when you find a good one. If you've found ""the one,"" then grab it before it slips away (or give me the guys phone number... :shades: ).  "
"plekto","February 2010"," The new 7 speed automatic is an attempt at making the problem better, but in reality, like all of these 6+ speed automatics, they end up being hideously expensive to replace when they do break. $4000+ for a new transmission just doesn't computer even if it were to last as long as the competition(try half as long most of the time).50-60K seems to be as much as you typically get out of a Mercedes automatic, while the manuals last for hundreds of thousands of miles.The number of speeds and complexity isn't a bragging right if it breaks all the time. "
"fedlawman","February 2010"," Oh, I never claimed they were bragging, and I never said these transmission were durable. I was merely pointing out that a lot of R&D goes into designing their sophisticated auto transmissions - specifically for the NA market. These are not taxi cab hand me downs.Of course, if you insist on buying any modern car, European or otherwise, with an a complex automatic, then the old adage, ""buyer beware"" comes to mind.The threads here (German, Japanese, and Domestic) are filled with people flailing their arms and seeking class action lawsuits because their transmissions failed at 80, 90, or 100K miles. Most of them , I'll venture to say, either bought the car second hand and have no idea of the maintenance history (or lack thereof), or bought their car new, and never thought to flush the tranny).I say, these days if you really want your transmission to last, row your own gears. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," Nobody buys a new transmission at 100K miles, should there be a failure. It's a real shame, it happens and is not limited to manfacturers due east of the United States.Honda, Infiniti, Acura, BMW, Mercedes all new transmission are between $3500 and $4500. People will buy a remanufactured transmission for thousands less. It's a rare bird that will swing for a new tranny at 100K. I also don't believe it's a normal occurence to have a Mercedes tranny fail at 100K. I'm not saying it never happens, heck I'm saying I'm sure it happens to all manufacturers, but not as a matter of course. "
"plekto","February 2010"," No, $2500 plus labor, tax, and so on is usually what the *rebuilt* ones go for. It's just insane.I found this in a typical search:C, E, and S Class Vehicle $2195.001996 and Up $300 CoreOnly a 12K/12 month warranty at that price as well. And that's if you buy direct. Your mechanic still has to install it, plus you pay tax and shipping and so on on the thing, plus tax on the install.$3500-$4K total for a *Rebuilt* one. Just insane. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," It is crazy. I just did a quick search. A remanufactured tranny for a 2004 G35 is $2250. I'm sure a new one is north of $4000. The reality is the typical G35 nor the typical Mercedes is not going to need a transmission for the life of the car. There are always the exceptions on both side.Here are the warranty terms on the Infiniti transmission:Our transmission comes with a 1-YEAR UNLIMITED WARRANTY. You may purchase our 2-YEAR WARRANTY for additional $1013.00. You may purchase our 3-YEAR WARRANTY for additional $2154.00.Core deposit: $800Not any different. "
"qbrozen","February 2010"," My Volvo is right around the $4k-$4500 mark, and that is for a rebuilt trans (no such thing as a new '01 auto trans).

Even that will run close to $3k, though, and that's with me doing all the labor myself. "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," If the car is an '01 you ought to be able to rack up 250k to 300k miles. In that time you might need a new tranny, in fact a lot of cars would require a tranny swap by 300000 miles. By the time you reach the point prices should drop. "

Maybe there's been a mistake on the server side and the posts are showing up here by accident. :confuse: "
"plekto","February 2010"," Well luxury and performance and making the best choice means weighing a lot of factors. Currently we have a problem where the best performing cars are often the least reliable, despite the fact that logic would suggest that if you spent 40-60K on a car, it should be built better than a normal Civic.The question that keeps being brought up is how do I get a luxury sport sedan that won't give my mechanic a free trip to Hawaii every time I get it worked on? "
"kdshapiro","February 2010"," I don't understand the issue. A lot of people I know own German made brands, nobody is sending their mechanics to easy street, and everybody can talk about their favorite (insert your manufacturer here) horror story. One reason I don't take any maintenance and repair board to heart when buying a car is because people complain before they kvell. I found out long ago, trying to be the perfect statistic according to any automotive survey is a crap shoot, so I don't buy according to those either. Do I care what JD Powers has to say? Not really.Manufacturers make warranties to fix cars that have issues. I buy the car I like and let the chips fall where they may. I don't worry about things. That's what lemon laws are for, although I've never needed to use them. The manfacturer who holds the distinction for the most trips to the dealer is Nissan. So needless to say I have no burning desire to own anymore models from them or their luxury brand.One last thing, if one spends a cool .5 million on a car your logic suggests it would be bullet-proof, since Honda can make a Civic nearly bullet-proof. However, it aint so, is it? Infiniti can't even make a G35 as bullet proof as a Civic. At least a Civic as far as I know has never had a recall to fix an issue that cause cause an engine fire. "

"smarty666","February 2010"," first off you talk to me that I'm not paying attention to the forum posts yet now your going off about the Civic? did you see what the title of this forum is? entry-level luxury sedans!! the word, Civic, Honda, Toyota, or Nissan shouldn't even be in this forum since none of their products are luxury cars - we should get back to discussing the cars listed on the right hand side of the screen!! by the way, why is the G35 listed for comparison here, lets update it to the G37; the G37 is a vast improvement over the early model year G35s in almost every regard!! kdshapiro is right though that you should, when deciding on a luxury car not put too much stock in what people say here or JD Power or any of the other car mags say because in the end you have to do what you want and you'll always get people who had the opposite experience with a companyfor instance, kdshapiro had trouble with Nissan and Infiniti, I have had the best luck with those two companies in regards to few problems and the fit/finish and reliability which contradicts what he said; I have several family members and friends who have German cars all who have had extensive problems with some of their BMWs and MBs! so my point is, you have to take what people say here with a grain of salt and basically talk to people YOU KNOW who have cars or car manufactures your looking into possibly getting and then make your own decisions what you want to do; really, any car this day, as kdshapiro pointed out is a gamble and that is why we have lemon laws and hopefully new recall laws to enable people who have problem with their cars to either get rid of them or get them fixed!!!

"rayainsw","February 2010"," As mentioned above, the 2 top contenders for my next car are currently the BMW 335iS & the Audi S4.I learned something about the Audi transmission behavior since I tested the first one available in the Atlanta area. So I decided to take another short test drive on Saturday morning. To see if what I had learned had a significant effect of the aspects of the dual clutch seven speed S Tronic trans. behavior that had concerned me in my previous test drive.And the short answer is: Yes.The fact that I did not know is the existence of a kickdown switch in the S4&#146;s throttle travel.From page 134 of the Owner&#146;s Manual:&#147;Kick-downKick-down enables maximum acceleration.When you press the accelerator pedal down beyond the resistance point, the automatic transmission downshifts into a lower gear, depending on vehicle speed and engine RPM. It shifts up into the next higher gear once the maximum specified engine RPM is reached&#148;My two objections to the transmission, when I drove one before, both had to do with the &#145;Manual-ness&#146; of the S Tronic when in &#147;Manual Mode&#148;. 1 - The automatic transmission downshifted when in Manual Mode & I floored the throttle. What I expected was: When in manual mode, remain in the gear selected, regardless of throttle position.2 &#150; My commands to upshift before redline when accelerating at WOT were [ ahem ] declined. Completely ignored.It turns out that I must have pressed right past that &#145;resistance point&#146;, and this caused the behaviors I observed.[ I did not know about this &#145;feature&#146; &#150; nor did the Sales Associate, when I questioned him about this. ]So, this kickdown \ resistance point at WOT actually addresses both my criticisms. Not pushing through this &#145;kick down&#146; switch makes a huge difference, for me.With substantial throttle [ essentially WOT, but not quite &#145;foot to the floor&#146; ] the upshift commands are answered &#150; quickly. And the shifts occur almost immediately &#150; and with authority. Very quick, but not jarring. Excellent. And almost surreal.And avoiding this switch also means no [ unwanted ] downshifts in manual mode, based only on throttle opening. We&#146;re good.I also confirmed that the trans. will upshift at red line &#150; not hang on rev limiter! The behavior I prefer.So &#150; I&#146;d still prefer that the trans. &#145;gear selected&#146; display be a bit larger, and higher in the dash display. . . But I can live with the current presentation, I suppose.And there is still one thing I do find somewhat annoying about the trans. At very low speeds, it automatically downshifts all the way to first &#150; making it difficult to drive smoothly at parking lot speeds.The rest of the car is impressive, to me: Interior comfort, materials & styling appeal to me.The handling is impressive.The handling feel, particularly considering the significant front weight bias, was quite responsive & satisfying.The ride was a bit harsh on cratered back streets, but this S4 had the 19&#148; tires & wheels &#150; where I&#146;d likely stick with the standard 18s.And the Audi Drive Select Package &#150; that includes the Sport Rear Diff.For European Delivery.Excellent.It is remotely possible that the 335iS, with 370 TQ and the performance exhaust may seduce me &#150; but, for now, the S4 is at the top of my &#145;short list&#146;.- Ray[ Note: It appears unlikely that the 335iS will be available for test at a Dealer before this June or July. Sigh. ] "
"plekto","February 2010"," I hear you about the odd transmissions. My biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correctly until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. A great example was when I was test-driving a RX8 a while back. At least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. So leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough engine compression to work fine(as long as you didn't hit the brakes).But when slowing down, it would do odd things. Say, I was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. It would always drop into top gear and then wait. Then when it thought I was at the right speed, select a gear for me. Now, I know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the brakes, the engine reverted to automatic. So a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then powering out of the corner wasn't possible if you used your brakes even the slightest bit. What happened was 35(tap brakes to slow down a little bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the EPA MPG tests). Then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to power out of the turn.It felt a lot like when you're at the top of a hill on a roller coaster and the thing disconnects from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are freed from the mechanism) Going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the engine compression evaporates completely. On the RX8, it was very disconcerting since the thing has no torque at all unless it's revved up to 3-4K+ It should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. Instead I got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time I hit the brakes to slow down a tiny bit. Which given the mile high gearing on most cars these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.Now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. No idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.BTW, check out the G37. It impressed me. "

"markcincinnati","February 2010"," The Audi offers, 3 1/2 different modes with the Tiptronic and ADS (D, S and M#1 and M#2, providing the ""1/2"" mode):D = Drive mode (but you get Drive Comfort or Drive Auto)S = Sport mode (still fully automatic shifting, but you get Drive Dynamic until you exit Sport mode) M = Manual mode #1 - where ""it"" decides how long you stay in M mode; ""it"" decides when to take you back to D mode or S mode if you have used the paddle shifters and were either in Drive or Sport when you used the paddle.M = Manual mode #2 - where it stays where you keep it, unless you slow below ""lugging"" then it will downshif from M6, to MN, where ""N"" is a lower gear based on road speed. In Manual mode #2, I do not actually know if you were in M4, for instance and pressed the pedal to the metal if it would down shift or not.

"slance66","May 2010"," After reading every forum and review known to man, I'm stumped. I'm driving an 07 Tribeca, which has good steering and loads of room, but bad ergonomics and a lousy tranny. My new commute, 3.25 miles each way. To avoid piling miles on my wife's RX350 (yes the Subie was hers, don't ask) I need something I can enjoy driving on backroads, and which my family of 3 can enjoy on long highway drives as much as the RX, with better mileage hopefully. Since I'll put few miles on it, anything with less than 70k on it used is on the table. I'm in New England, with a steep driveway,so RWD is a dicey proposition.

"plekto","May 2010"," (mulls over the data)The best car for you would be a white 2009 Pontiac G8.(the other colors are ""meh"" and most women want that pearlescent white) Good reliability, low price, handles very well. Overall a great deal for the money that unfortunately GM in its idiocy decided to stop selling. I drove one and it was about 80% as nice as the previous generation CTS, which is what I'd probably have otherwise recommend. But the fact that you want midsize over luxury and are considering the Mazda 6, plus the G35 means a few years old or certified is also in the consideration... (I get a $25K new/used price range, right?)It really was an eye-opener. GM as usual, has their second best car aside from the new CTS NOT for sale in the U.S. It's still sold in Australia, and is the #1 car there. Be sure to get the premium audio but NOT the nav, since that radio/information center is incredible and NAV systems are a waste of money.(just get a portable model for $300) One look at the radio and you'll see that it's the best radio/information center GM has ever built. Note - the 2007 CTS is also an absolute steal. As the last year of the previous style, it has few reliability issues, looks and handles great, and well, it's under $20K for a certified example. There's probably no better used deal right now that I can think of, especially since in three months, off-lease models will start to appear.(4 years old is the sweet spot for certified/off-lease executive type cars)No reason to buy now, though.

"slance66","May 2010"," Well every car on my list is a ""luxury"" brand and this is the entry level luxury form. I mentioned the Mazda only because it seems all around capable. The only GM I've ever owned is a 1970 Cutlass convertible. I have planned on continuing that streak. I find the CTS mostly unattractive, and it was unfortunate that Acura has been copying all the harsh angles. The new LaCrosse is good looking, but I'm just not that old. There is no way a G8 will ever get up my driveway in winter, and the styling? Maybe when I was 15. I'd get a CTS first for sure.I feel like the default pick is a 3-series, but the run-flat tires don't appeal and the out of warranty service could be a problem. Maybe I should chance the Audi reliability with an A6. It does everything else well. "
"plekto","May 2010"," The previous generation CTS is a lot less ugly than the new one and would be my pick, then. The pearl white and light blue are very nice and are aimed at female buyers. YOU might not like the CTS, but your wife probably will love it after a test drive after her old car she's been suffering with.I know this as my mother is looking for the exact same type of car - and the CTS keeps staying on her top 3 list.That's a nice car - lighter colors hide the angles a lot.Look, the simple fact is that anything from BMW, Audi, or Mercedes will literally cost you thousands a year in repairs and maintainance once it's out of warranty. I'm talking about idiocy like $6000-$12000 transmissions and $500 for a sensor under the hood. You have been warned if you go down that path. And, it's not really luxury to put pleather in a car these days.(no typo - real leather starts typically in the 40-60K+ range) Simply put, if you can't afford it new, these will destroy you financially, used.****07 Lexus E350: FWD?

New one is hideous.Acua TSX: Too small...glorfied Civic. ****Your original list immediately shrinks to this. Lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - I'll get to them in a bit). Infiniti is great. The G37 Journey is fantastic. And, honestly, NONE of the AWD system in cars unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. It's pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. So either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a Subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. Or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.Interesting that you say that the new 2009 TSX is small - it's much larger than the older one and I thought it would be a perfect fit.Anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly engineered. I can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum can't begin to reach the limits of a first generation CTS, let alone something like a G37. So, the two Lexus exceptions you should look at:The IS300 was perhaps the closest thing Japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small European sport sedan feel. They also are one of the least expensive luxury sport sedans ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. I'd look at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. I'd also say the same thing about a 2007 CTS - DRIVE it and then decide if it's bad or not. The other one is a 2005 Lexus GS300. What makes this car special is that it is RWD and has a 3.0L inline 6 engine. As a result, it has great reliability, smoothness, power, and does it while getting good MPG. There's a reason BMW and uses inline 6 engines, and Lexus got it exactly right with both the IS300 and the GS300(same engine, btw, in both).Why did they change? They worshiped HP and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. Then again, to be honest, both designs are dated compared to the CTS, which was a real game changer. Other than that, you're looking at a Volvo or maybe a SUV. The reality is fo rused cars:Japan - reliable, expensive to fix, costly to buy used.(depreciate too slowly)GM - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally)BMW/Mercedes/Audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock) "
"tlong","May 2010"," Disagree that BMW/Mercedes/Audi depreciate like a rock. They actually have really good residuals, as does VW. The driving experience and interiors of these cars raise their values even though the maintenance is high and reliability is highly variable. I've owned VW and Audi and I love the vehicles. I've had pretty good luck with reliability, but you are correct - if you have to pay for the repair it is not going to be pretty. When I owned an Audi (not THAT bad for repairs and reliability) I wished for a very reliable Japanese car.Then I got rid of it and bought an Acura TL. I now have a very reliable Japanese (brand) car. And I really long for the Audi!Pick your poison; I am still searching for the European driving experience together with the Japanese reliability. Let me know when you find it.  "
"plekto","May 2010"," I am still searching for the European driving experience together with the Japanese reliability. Let me know when you find it. One car fits that bill, a used IS300. I know, I drove everything, and the only *Japanese* car in your price range that feels like a European model is that one.Now, domestics have that as well, though reliability is a little less. It's still worlds better than BMW or Audi, though. GM has spent a lot of time testing their cars in Germany lately, and the G8, CTS, and a few others show it. They feel properly ""European"" as well. "
"slance66","May 2010"," Yes this is exactly my problem! My prior car was a Volvo S60, which was a compromise that fell just short on both counts. Still it was an excellent car for 9 years. Now I'm in a bullet-proof Subaru Tribeca. Build quality is amazing, but I want a sedan again and better than the 23 highway MPG I get with the Tribeca. As for the CTS mentioned previously, my wife hates them. She has a Lexus RX350, so she's very happy with that. She wants me to get a soul-less Lexus ES350, which she loves. I'm looking for a little more of the European driving experience than that, even a TL would be better. I'm looking at used because I pay cash for cars, never had a payment and I don't want one and because new cars are a rip-off, especially for someone with a 3 mile commute. "
"plekto","May 2010"," Ah. Bit clearer now. The G37 sedan is your likely best bet, then. It's big, luxurious(just get the Journey package with the wood trim and NO sport package), and handles far better than your Volvo did. It also costs the least per repair of any of the luxury models, so that's a plus. It's a much more refined car than the G35, which felt like a 4 door Z. IMO, it's critical to get the wood and interior premium packages with the Infiniti and TL/TSX and NOT to get the upgraded suspension or tires. The stock suspension is exactly firm enough and gives the car a slightly sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.There is one more option as well, but that's only if you like manual transmissions. The Mercedes C class is actually a perfectly decent vehicle if you don't get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break AND get manual as well. Of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. Avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from Mercedes with an automatic.The gem of course was a 2003-2005 C230K *sedan*. The replacement for it is a tremendous seller in Europe(now C300K, iirc). It gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the ""real deal"". But only if you get manual. (the manual is easily as refined as the 3 series - almost video game easy) "
"roadburner","May 2010"," A BMW won't be as inexpensive to run as a Honda, but they are nowhere near as expensive to maintain as the urban legends some like to parrot. Since 1983 I've always had one or more BMWs in the garage; I currently own a 1995 3 Series as well as a 2004 X3(and a 1975 2002- but that's a hobby car). The 3er has 121K miles on it and the X3 has 92K miles on the clock. Maintenance and repair costs for both are averaging @5 cents per mile(in the case of the X3, that number is calculated over the 42K miles after the free maintenance plan expired). Non-scheduled repairs on the 3er have consisted of a brake light switch, a thermostat, and the serpentine belt idler pullies. The X3 has required a passenger seat SRS sensor(replaced under warranty). Of the cars you mentioned, I'd take an E39 530i- with the Sport Package, of course. It's a fantastic car; many enthusiasts(myself included) think that it is superior to its E60 successor.As for non BMWs, I'd also take a look at the Mazdaspeed 6. I find the Lexus models to be terribly unsafe;if I drove one I'd almost certainly die of boredom...  "
"slance66","May 2010"," Yeah G37 looks nice, but is beyond my ""no car payments"" price point, since it's a new model. I drove a G35x, and liked it except that what I'd like even more is a detuned model with 230-240HP and better mileage. The 4 door Z description is right on. Where is the balance? I agree on the wood in the Inifiniti and Acura, the metal looks too ""techno"" and cold, and agree on the suspension and tires. Anything less than an aspect ratio of 55 is way too hard to handle our broken New England pavement without punishing your kidneys.I don't need Nav...I would opt for it in a Japanese car, as I expect it to be trouble free. I can't get a manual, as my wife can't drive them. So Auto it is, but I like the idea of de-electifying a MB. I really like the 2008+ C class, looks better and the prior version was awfully small in the back. Prices are still high though. Haven't checked the 03-05, but will look at specs. I had the same thought with BMW...a 525xi with no i-drive. I'd rather a nice cupholder than that knob. At least MBs have cupholders. "
"slance66","May 2010"," roadburner, if I had an indi BMW mechanic nearby, I'd probably put an E39 530i near the top of my list. I've seen several of them for sale, at good prices. Snow tires and wheels would be a definite expense however, for any RWD car. Even then I'd worry about my steep driveway, but a 5 series should have good weight distribution. Are there any known big expenses with those (I assume timing belt...what mileage?). "
"plekto","May 2010"," The base G37 starts at almost exactly $30K new(cars direct has one for $30,200 after $1K in incentives!) So used run 4-8K less. The Journey with premium and maple wood accents(2010 only  ) is $34,115(advertised street price). So 25K for a 1-2 year old example is possible to find.

It's a stunning color in person and looks like a very expensive car. Doubly so since it's the new model. I know how women want to be seen in the new model if possible  Maybe it's not required, but it's certainly a feather in their cap if it's new bling vs old bling. My brain also did a double-take at these prices. If you can wait until September when the 2011 models come out, a 2010 with that nice wood trim will be available in the 25K range.edit - they have 0% and 2.9% financing now, so this fall, expect great incentives on a 2010. I can't find one, but the light interior and wood trim makes it feel much more luxury inside. "
"roadburner","May 2010"," No US spec BMW engine has used a timing belt since late 1991. The cooling system is the only major issue. Most owners practice preventative maintenance and replace the water pump, thermostat, and radiator at @100K miles. My indie shop charged me @$1000 to do the work on my wife's 528i back in 2005(it's an easy afternoon DIY job but it was the middle of winter and my wife needed the car pronto). I bought a set of winter tires/wheels and changed them out myself in November and March; the car had no trouble in any sort of winter weather. There's a great E39 group non Yahoo as well as several websites dedicated to the E39. It is just a fantastic car.

"slance66","May 2010"," Some nice possibilities, especially at that price. Hopefully the new auto tames it a bit, but it shocks me that they don't make a version with better mileage at 250HP.

MPG is terrible, so I'd honestly probably just get an M35x instead, since it is plenty fast enough for me, and there are lots of used ones. Need to drive a 2003 530i too..and probably a few others. "
"plekto","May 2010"," Well, funny you should mention that... :P The G25 is coming out this fall. Same car, smaller ~220hp engine. The base model should be in the $27-28K range(msrp at $29-30K would be my guess, invoice closer to $27K). Finding a program/dealer car a few months old for $25K should be possible. That is, if you can wait 5-6 months.And, yes, the automatic tames it quite a bit. It drives more like a 5 series or E class than a Z. (that said, yes, it will make scenery go by very, very fast.)There are pictures online but Nissan is keeping very mum about the car. My guess is that they want the competition to get theirs out first and under-cut them. I'd suspect that they are worried about the IS250 and the new Regal, though the Regal is out now, so we might expect a major announcement sometime soon.EDIT:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_SkylineIt's sold as the Skyline 250GT(same exact car as the G25, essentially) and is currently on sale in Japan. The combined fuel economy for the car (testing comes from Singapore, of all places) lists it as roughly 24-25mpg combined, with a highway figure of close to 35mpg. One site in Japan lists it as getting 38mpg in a test, but that was on a track under controlled conditions. And it should weigh about 3250lbs - about 300lbs lighter than the G37. This will make it a great car among people who like mountain roads, since the only complaint with the G37/Z370 is its weight is a bit more than you'd like for serious mountain roads.G37 5.6 seconds.G25 7.0 seconds. (that's about a second faster than the IS250 and Regal)It's not stupidly fast, but it certainly isn't a slouch, either. Getting that type of performance out of a tiny engine like that is amazing, really. If they pull it off, it'll be the equivalent of a hat-trick. Low cost, sport/luxury, and economy car mpg. All while NOT being slow. "
"slance66","May 2010"," Interesting...looks like they dropped a beefed up version of the 2.5L four from the Altima in? Or is this a smaller displacement V6?. I really like the small 6 in the IS250 and the efficient 6 in the 328. I can't see paying premium prices for anything with a 4, although I've considered it with the Audi/VW 2.0T. I wonder where the weight drop comes from? 7 sec 0-60 is not bad at all. Fortunately, I do have time...no hurry really.***Just read a few reports. No turbo, 2.5L V6, specs around the 220 mentioned. Of course some writers asked ""why move downmarket"". Do these writers live in the real world? Not long ago, 220 was pretty powerful...300 was reserved for rarified company. This is a brilliant move. "
"plekto","May 2010"," Yeah, 220HP is plenty, as it comes close to the 15lbs/HP make-or-break sweet spot. (14.7 actually) For reference, that is 3000lbs and 200HP plus at least 200lb-ft of torque.(basically a 6 cylinder engine, preferably as small and quick to rev as possible)The IS300 was very close to this magic ratio. BMW has tried to maintain this as well, though the recent 3 series' are too fat and suffers greatly in handling compared to the E36, which is still the best choice - it's the last ""classic"" BMW worth getting. But, at 10 year old, now, it's a dicey proposition due to maintainance.That's why the 1 series is so popular - lighter and quicker on its feet for a fairly reasonable price. It eeks just under the 3000lb limit/ proper ratio. Very fun to drive as a result.The problem with the Regal and IS250 is that they are in the 3500-3600lb range and lose their edge. Not *quite* fast enough, not *quite* agile enough. Sure, the bigger versions (IS350 and Regal GS when it comes out) are stomping, wild beasts, but they lose that small sport sedan feel,. And they cost a lot more money. "
"qbrozen","May 2010"," I'd be surprised if they could cut 300 lbs compared to the G37. I mean, we're talking same platform. Changing just the engine wouldn't save that much. Unless they are going to use lightened body panels, which would add cost, I don't see it happening. "
"markcincinnati","May 2010"," . . .why not look at a new Genesis (with the 6) sedan. A friend of mine bought one and he says the deals on them are ""impressive."" He had come from a 5 series Bimmer, the last in a string of many, too. . . . Far as I can tell, although he is hardly rich beyond the dreams of avarice, he bought because of the deal compared to the deal plus the content differences on yet another RWD 5 series, not because he no longer could afford a 5 series.I thought, at the time, he was crazy -- now, not so much. And, before you think I am crazy, my current Audi (#29 in my life -- including the ones that have been mine or my wife's) is an '09 A4 Prestige with the 19"" sport package and ADS on it -- I live in Cincinnati (that is we have about a 70 30 ratio of road to potholes); all that lovely sportiness I paid for is virtually useless. I play dodgem' with my car -- and including the factory originals have now had 12 tires (4 OE plus 8 replacements) due to tire damage. I love the sport quotient of these great German cars (and probably the Japanese and American cars of the same ilk) -- but frankly, until the US, Ohio, Hamilton County, Cincinnati infrastructure reaches a road to pothole ratio of 95 5, my cars sport/lux quotient is great to look at but virtually impossible to enjoy (much.) If I could get an AWD Genesis, I'd probably seriously consider it -- or a tank with rubber treads.Perhaps a new or demo or leftover Genesis (or lightly used one) is out there somewhere at an even better price. The warranty is impressive and the car certainly seems to push many of your buttons. :shades: "

"slance66","May 2010"," You're not crazy. I was just looking at the Genesis. Power is there with the 3.8, mileage is better than most, and honestly, is a damned handsome car when you see it on the street or in a parking lot. My biggest concern personnally is the size...I look at an A6 and think, damn, that's a bit bigger than ""mid-size"". Then comparing the the Genesis to the A6, it is longer, but not as wide. It is longer and wder than a 5 series, M35 or MB E350. I just don't know if I want to drive anything that big (length in particular). Lack of AWD is a drawback. "
"qbrozen","May 2010"," Lack of AWD is a drawback.Only if you are offroading or deal with 6 months of snow, IMHO.I made it through 3 blizzards this year with a '92 Benz with snow tires. No traction control. No stability control. Just the snow tires and an antiquated ABS. Not one iota of drama driving in horrible conditions (had to take 9-month pregnant wife to the hospital in the middle of the night after 2 feet had fallen and no signs of letting up). I'm a convert. I am no longer concerned about having a RWD daily driver. (although that is all I grew up with, so go figure why I, and so many other people, have forgotten we survived it then, so we'll survive it now.) "
"slance66","May 2010"," On AWD, I look at it this way: I have a 20 plus degree grade in my driveway, so hill climbing is critical. RWD will suffer compared to AWD at hill climbing, even with snow tires (it will better AWD in stopping and turning with snows vs all weather). Then there is the cost of buying wheels and tires, and paying for the changeover and storage (I have no room for 4 sets of wheels/tires). The cost probably evens out, but AWD is just more convenient, and you don't have the occasional early or late snow, or the unusually warm winter days that chew up your snow tires. So I could give it a try...hell I grew up driving a 77 Cougar in the snow...no ABS, no traction control, and horrifically bad front/rear weight balance. Of course it couldn't climb our snow covered driveway then either. "
"plekto","May 2010"," If you have a 20 degree driveway, you need 4 wheel drive. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7dVFY5CxT0&feature=relatedThe problem is that the systems try to out-think the situation and react too slowly. So they get stuck and actually in some cases literally stop turning ANY of the wheels despite the throttle being on full. 6:15 is the part to watch - a dirt hill climb.What appears to happen with most of them is that the system transfers enough power to the rear wheels to merely keep the vehicle's place stable on the hill and does the climbing with the fronts alone. This works to a point. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xJusLJQbv8Ouch.Trust me - almost all of the drive systems that transfer power back and forth fail like this and are only good for getting unstuck from a flat snowy driveway or the side of a road. Note - Subaru and a few others are full-time AWD and do work. Part-time is rubbish, so don't bother wasting your money.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXOPcwMnC6c&feature=related4wd.

There are 6 in the series - it's very informative, if a bit repetitive.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXuhfwY74b8A bit more funny  "
"slance66","May 2010"," Here's my experience so far:2000 Volvo v70 XC: usually climbed the driveway with few problems2001 FWD S60: had major problems, even with just light snow. However, I when put Nokian WR all season/snow tires on, and it climbed as well as the XC did.07 Lexus RX350: Climbs pretty well, similar to the Volvo.07 Subaru Tribeca: Climbs ok, but slides more than the Lexus or Volvo XC, and is much worse going down. Why? 255-55-18 tires act like snow saucers. Stupid choice by Subaru. So I'm reluctant to move away from AWD, and the modern electronic systems do work better, in my experience, than the YouTube videos show, especially when good AS tires are used. In fact, the superior Subaru system proves less important than the tires in most respects. "
"qbrozen","May 2010"," the superior Subaru system proves less important than the tires in most respectsThat's really the key point. If someone NEEDS awd/4wd, then they also need to be concerned about what tires are on there. It is the most important part of the car. "

I have pictures during the winter where cars were parked at the bottom of the driveway. For those houses the trucks and AWD models were the ones that made it up the driveway.Until I move to San Diego (or Phoenix), AWD will stay on every vehicle in the family. "

If I had to deal with huge snowfalls and unplowed roads on a regular basis, I would get a big truck with AWD and outfit it with snow tires. "
"slance66","June 2010"," Well the search continues. I drove a 2008 Lexus IS250 AWD. Not fast, but not a dog either. Cockpit was nice, if slightly tight.

Wondering if I can suffer FWD again with an ES, which would be bigger and faster...without the handling.Next stop, a 2007 328xi.

I've also driven all kinds of vehicles, from subcompact cars to pick-ups and full-size vans. No matter which wheels are driven, winter tires are BY FAR the best choice. I've had better control in 4 inches of snow with a 2WD pick-up with winter tires than an AWD compact with all-seasons. Don't forget the weight penalty (and worse fuel economy) that AWD adds compared to a similar FWD/RWD vehicle, the better chances of driveline/mechanical issues/failure, and the tighter tolerances in terms of tires (which adds to more out-of-pocket $$$$$).AWD is by no means a necessity in the snow belt, as long as you know how to drive in the snow, and use a set of proper winter tires that also help to STOP and STEER, not just accelerate.And, yes, I'll be hoping to ""make"" it through.

"jtla","July 2010"," Thanks for the link to 2011 Volvo S60 T6 AWD. I read it the first time you posted. The new S60 looks promising. I think its T6 engine power output -- 300 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque -- is among the top of this group, especially the torque. IMO, Volvo did a fine job in both exterior styling and interior layout. As to handling, we will have to wait until the car hits the showroom and do a proper test drive.While this car may be a legitimate contender, the biggest problem for Volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition. For performance, the 3-series and G37 still lead the pack. For luxurious feels, TL and A4 may have the edge. For dependability reputation, the Japanese brands are always safer bets. For badge shoppers, MB certainly sounds more prestigious. Safety is Volvo's strong suite, but others are not far behind. A Volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment.

It's seems more like a sportier Toyota Avalon to me... "
"smarty666","July 2010"," Excellent topic to say the least, considering I have a 3G FWD TL, a FWD Maxima, the new one, and a RWD Infiniti I think I can add some decent insight on this. I can tell you this, the CVT does take a little away from making the Maxima a true sports sedan, like a G37 or 3-Series, but that is only b/c of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock. The Maxima is just as sporty as the 4G FWD TL, but FWD in itself does have limitations that RWD obviously and my 3G TL has a more sporty flair to it then the 7G Maxima. The new Maxima has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and I've been able to keep up with higher powered V6's with both A/T and MT so the power and performance of the Maxima is not hindered by the CVT in the least. Saying the Maxima is a sportier version of an Avalon is a little bit ridiculous to me. Drive both cars back to back and they are totally different. The Maxima's handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the FWD market, except for say Mazda maybe. I would go as far as to say, that the Maxima is about as sporty as you can go in performance, driving dynamics, handling, etc for a FWD sedan without having to spend more money and go into a RWD luxury division vehicle. It is a four door sports sedan, no, the CVT and FWD layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan. Except for one or two things, the CVT is not as bad as people make it out to be. It takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular A/T and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong In regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. The Maxima is an oddity and hard to classify. Its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and Nissan in the same sentence and I can understand that. On the other hand, the power/performance, price, luxury sedan features, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level luxury classification. Everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what. I've heard people classify the Maxima has followed over the years, ""entry-level luxury sedan,"" ""premium full-size sedan,"" ""near luxury sedan."" Pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. It really, in the grand scheme of things doesn't mean jack squat! "
"kfdmed","July 2010"," Have any driven the Maxima CVT for any period of time? Driven it in the sport mode? The CVT in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock ... the engine revs more like a traditional auto transmission. I once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a CVT? After using it for a while I understand why they included with the CVT. I drove the base FWD TL and Maxima back to back and dont think the TL is any more ""sporty"" than the Maxima. "
"smarty666","July 2010"," The 4G FWD TL is less sporty in my opinion then the 7G FWD Maxima, not by much but enough I noticed a difference. The Maxima had a slightly firmer/sportier ride and feedback, slightly better handling, and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier. Your right the CVT in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the engine revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular A/T. Now, once you move up to the AWD 6 M/T version of the 4G TL, that the TL becomes sportier than the new Maxima, but the base version is definitely tamer then the new Maxima.Remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the CVT b/c of what happened with the 1G version of it from 2003-2008. Since 2009, all the Nissan products have the updated 2G CVT which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer problems then the 1G had. Nissan extended the transmission warranty so the CVT for them is here to stay! So far I overall really like the CVT and the fuel econ for 290HP is absolutely fabulous. "

"marcus216","July 2010"," I currenlty own a 2010 TL SH-AWD. I looked at the RL also. To be honest, I can't understand why anyone would buy or lease the current RL versus the TL. The TL is slightly larger, has the same engine, gets better gas mileage and is thousands less. Yes, the RL in its current form is quite dated but has some nice attributes. My suggestions for the next generation RL is to make it a few inches wider, about 6 inches longer (adding back seat room and trunk space). Instead of rear wheel drive, they can keep the current AWD platform and use a turbo charged V6 engine that produces 300+ ft/lbs of torque and around 330+ HP. Acura utilizes turbo charging technology in the RDX , so it is not new technology for them. BMW, Audi, and even Ford are using turbo charging with great success. "
"kevinc5","July 2010"," Finally, someone gets it right. Thanks. (A long time Bimmer fan.) "
"smarty666","July 2010"," Exactly, Acura screwed themselves on the RL just like Nissan, until the newest generation of course, did with the Maxima and Altima. They made the Altima more powerful, nicer materials, etc over their flagship Maxima, which then in turn hurt the Maxima b/c the Altima was cheaper and you were getting more for your money. Thankfully Nissan rectified this problem with the 2009-pres Maxima but will see if they screw it up again when the Altima is redone again for 2012 model year. Acura did the same thing to their flagship right now (the RL) with the current TL in the regards you pointed out. "

"marcus216","August 2010"," I don''t think comparing the TL to the A4, S4, 3 series, or G37 is an accurate comparison due to the fact the the TL is considerably larger. Why not compare the new Infiniti M series to the S4 or a Mercedes E 350 to a G37? The only thing the TL has in common with the smaller cars is price. I would not expect a TL to be able to run a slalom course with any of the above cars due to the shear bulk of the TL compared to the others. 0-60 times have the same issue. I could care less whether a TL can beat an S4 to 60 mph. My TL SH-AWD comes close to equaling most performance measures of an S4 . And when I entertain clients, I can put two full sized adults in the back seat of my TL in comfort. And the list price of my TLwas about $9,000 less than a comparably equipped S4. "

"marcus216","August 2010"," Before my TL SH-AWD purchase, I drove every midsize luxury performance sedan out there. E350, 5 Series, M37, Audi A6, GS 350 to name a few. And, in my opinion, the TL in terms of power, handling, comfort, amenities, and over all luxury feel is in the ball park with all the cars mentioned here. Now, if price were not a consideration, would I choose the TL over a 5 series or A6, probably not. But the TL is $10,000+ less comparably equipped. That is a huge advantage. Another advantage to the TL that the others don't have is the SH-AWD. When you take a corner hard in the TL, it almost defies physics as you can feel the outside wheels forcing the car into the turn. It is a unique feeling and makes for a fun drive. I also drove a Buick LaCrosse and with the exception of a beautiful interior, the LaCrosse does not measure up to the TL in performance areas and is not the same type of car, more of a nice luxury sedan. Regarding the RL, that is a dated design that needs a change. I assume the next gneration RL will be a step up in size and maybe power from the current TL to differentiate it. But who knows. Again, the TL does compare well to the other sedans. It is a tremendous value in this very competitive segment. "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," That's why I dont read those silly comparison test because it is just useless to the everyday driver.

Unless you take the car over to Skip Barber race track, then these things become a reality.Secondly, did they test the 328I manual 6spd and the Audi manual against the TLAWD? I am guessing they did. They need to test a 328xi automatic and audi automatic AWD against the TL AWD. "
"slance66","August 2010"," The cars they choose to review are annoying.

"rayainsw","August 2010"," A few assertions in posts 11286 & 11287 that I&#146;d like to comment on here.86 - I read lots of comparisons. I find the test results of use in several ways.

But the handling tests that the various publications conduct allow me to judge & compare how high those limits are, and how the vehicle behaves at or near those limits &#150; in case I ever do need to approach them, due to unforeseen events.Though I very rarely do 0 &#150; 60, I do 40 &#150; 65 regularly, in highway merge situations, and just for fun.

"nyccarguy","August 2010"," He actually USED to drive a TSX. He sold it and bought an E30 M3 (no further explaination needed).The chat is ENTRY LEVEL LUXURY PERFORMANCE SEDANS (not for the Money).I think it is a fantastic category. Each car is different in its own way. Each car is better in its own way. Different things matter to different people as far as entry level luxury performance sedans go. I'd be happy with most of them.Yes BMWs do get pricey if you load them up with lots of goodies, but the chassis dynamics & balance of a 3 series (even a 328i) make it WELL WORTH the price of admission. Not only does a 328i handle extremely well, but it also rides comfortably. Tremendous brakes & wonderful steering are 3 series hallmarks. The 3 is a great car for 1 person or if it is a 2nd car, I think personally the E90 sedan is on the small side. There are other costs to consider besides the price paid for the car. BMW includes scheduled maintenance. Check out the prices of CPO 3 series vs. a CPO G. If you've got the time, European Delivery is available for the BMW & now you're talking 335i car for 328i price. The 3 also gets decent fuel economy. 6 Speed stick availability is a BIG PLUS for me. I have a terriffic service advisor at BMW that treats my family and I like royalty. ""What's that Bradd, your Dad drove over an 2x4 in the snow that busted his radiator on his X5 and he's stopped in the middle of the bridge in a snowstorm? He's OK? Good. Are the dogs with him? You're in the towtruck?"" There were no service appointments available for 4 days and no loaner cars available for at least a week and a half. I drove out of the dealership in an hour with a loaner car which they let me keep for the 3 & a half weeks my Dad's truck was being fixed. I agree with you that for the money, the G37 is very hard to beat. I've been on Infiniti's ""build your own"" site and my ideal G37S 6 Speed has an MSRP of $39K and change. You can buy the car for what, $36K? I've driven a G37X before. I love the accleration. The car is extremely well balanced & feels like it turns on an axis. The VQ isn't nearly as smooth as the BMW I6 & it guzzles gas (even with a 7 speed automatic). 6 Speed stick availability is a plus for me.The A4 is a nice car too. Very roomy compared to the 3 & the G. Rides smooth. Brakes don't have the bite of the 3 or the G. Amazingly finished interior, gorgeous materials. A very sharp looking car with the S Line Sports Package. Turbo With 258 lb ft torque & great highway mileage. Even though all the others offer AWD, they offer it because of QUATTRO. My Mom had an '02 A6 and I'm nowhere near impressed with Audi's customer service.I actually think the IS is a handsomely styled car. LEXUS came so close with the 1st generation IS, that I was disapointed with the second gen version. It has aged well though. The IS350's accleration rivals that of the G37 & 335i. The interior is well finished, beautiful, and very comfortable. The back seat is about as useful as my Prelude's. They do offer some type of Sports Package that supposedly makes the handling razor sharp. There is something to be said about LEXUS reliability too. The IS250's 204 hp V6 is laughable at this price point. Not only is it snail slow, but doesn't get that good gas mileage. 6 speed stick only available on the IS250. Brakes are instant on with ZERO linear feel, but they do stop the car now. I felt the handling to be disconnected.Say what you want about the TL SH AWD, but it is the only one of these cars that is real sized. Gonna go out with another couple? The other 3 people will vote Acura every day of the week and twice on Sunday. It has a big trunk too. Available 6 speed stick w/ SH AWD makes it very competitive in this segment. Under all the glitz and glamour, it is still a Honda. A big plus for me.Personally, I've never been a big fan of the C-Class. SO if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. It is a good looking car.That new Volvo S60 has been getting good reviews (except from Car & Driver).I think those are the major players. "

The RWD/FWD debate is overrated much like the manual/auto trans debate.Yes I know how to shift gears and work a clutch. Yes I have driven rear wheel cars. No, I am not sixteen anymore and don't care to drive like I am on the autobahn.The TL/AWD, CTS/4, and G37X are the best choices. The Germans are just ugly/boring and expensive. Why Lexus is on the right I don't know. "
"tlong","August 2010"," Don't know how you can call that post credible when you talk about butt ugly but then like the new TL. And I'm a TL owner (2005!).I agree the Bangle BMWs were a styling step backwards. Not real pretty. "
"ivan_99","August 2010"," ""I would think that to be a very heavy vehicle with (280 hp?) not enough motivation""Yeah...I think that motor has been around for 5 years or so; time to upgrade i think. But still not too far behindI thought about a CC 2.0T and chipping it...making a fun project car. But when they first came out you couldn't get the Nav system (really nice) with a manual. Their auto wasn't the DSG...just a regular 6spd (plus my wife was giving me a hard time about a 4 seater)I had a few cars between the old G35 and IS350 (I have a problem).I did a CPO for the IS350. I was looking at CPO'd 335's...coupe. I was scared off by the maintenance stories (the IS has not been perfect...even requiring a tow truck--boost). I thought the BMW was gorgeous, but didn't care for the interior. The Lexus CPO was better than the BMW and one of the 335's I drove was only auto (i know like the IS  ). The manual 335 i drove was a base...again the interior threw me off. Materials and quality were good, it just didn't look right to me (or not as good as others...although i'm tiring of the IS interior...that problem i have) .An A5 would have been my first choice, but the price got too high (the S5 was a dream to drive---felt like James Bond  ). The new A4 wasn't out yet...love the recent Audi's. I really liked the CTS as well; it just didn't feel as good as the others The new MB C was out, but I couldn't find a price similar to the IS's CPO (they were too new) -- it drove similar to the IS.I probably wouldn't buy another IS today. I get very annoyed by Auto trannies; they never do what i want them to. I can rant even further about the shiftable auto trannies like the IS and CTS (etc)...shift...wait...wait...wait...wait...gear change (if you ever see a grown man screaming at the shift leaver...that is me  ) BTW -- Like the DSG I can't drive the IS in 'normal' mode...i have to leave it in 'power' mode. This alters the throttle response (makes it shift less smooth -- sometimes jerky ). In normal mode I feel like i'm going to loose my mind; think driving a Corolla in the sand. The traction control comes on WAY too early (this is an 06); I believe they altered it for other years. You can disable the traction control...through an esoteric sequence of brake and parking brake taps...at every startup.The thing I like the least is the low torque at normal driving speeds. If you squeeze the pedal too slow you're left wondering if something is wrong. You have to learn to tap it just right to get a one or two down-shift.If you keep the pedal down and past 4K the thing flys; but at this point you're getting into triple digits and you'll need a good layer and a lenient Judge...mommy why's daddy in jail...During my test drives i was a maniac so I didn't notice the little nuances in 'normal' driving; which I suppose we all have to do at some point But it's an ok car...I like it...looks nice, interior is fine. Goes fast when I need to. My average mileage is 22ish which i'm content with.Think my next car will have to be a coupe...or a tunned up turbo something...or both "

"ivan_99","August 2010"," What did you have between the 2 cars? It seems like you're dissatisfied with the Lexus, so why hold on to it? Unless it is a financial reason. I had a 2003 accord -- 4 cyl 5 speed (I run the gamut from mid-end to affordable low end...); funny thing is I made *sure* with my wife that the manual was fine...took about 3-4 months...then after we got it...""I can't believe I have to use the clutch with my bad knees"" :confuse: We already had a mini van...so I thought -- why do i need another family car...and it wentThen it was a Mazda 3i 5speed sedan. Great car, one of my favorite...it was like the whole body was carved out of one piece--very solid and composed. I took a test drive, didn't look in the trunk or try the stereo or sit in the back seat...was very impressed (sport package) and said ""I'll take it"". Fun car (more than my IS)...but the engine was lacking (didn't care for the hatch which is where the 3SPEED was limited to) and it was too buzzy on the highway (really needed a 6 speed).Then it was an Infiniti Q45. V8 was very nice...but way too quiet. Car wallowed a bit too much. It was luxurious, but I quickly felt like an old man. When I had this I was at a VW dealership with a co-worker and the salesman convinced me to take a test drive (he didn't have to try hard) . I took a VW Fahrenheit GTI and loved the burble sound of the engine compared to my quiet V8.I still would have kept the Q45 longer except I had an encounter with a deer...nobody tells you the air bag could rip all the hairs off your arms with friction...think wax scene from 40 year old virgin...The longest I've kept a car (other than our min-van) is almost 3 years...a 99 1/2 Audi A6; 10 years later and i still think the interior is one of the best out there.I'll probably keep the IS longer...it's a CPO which isn't transferable. So you end up paying a few $k more than 'normal' when you purchase it. I'm tired of being 'upside down' when trading in so i figure I picked it for a reason...and those reasons must have been valid at the time...basically talking myself out of going car shopping; which I enjoy...i can take a new mini-van out and have a good time.

"nyccarguy","August 2010"," to check out the C300 Sport w/ 6 speed stick tonight. They had it advertised in the paper for $309 per month for 36 months. Now this is for 10K miles per year, paying the taxes up front, with a $1999 cap cost reduction.They did actually have 2 C300 w/ 6 Speed sticks on the lot. The car is really nice. Very handsome & aggressive looking. I really like the headlight cluster and the big 3 pointed star in the middle of the grille. Roomier inside than an E90 3 series. The trunk was quite large for a car of this class & size. Interior materials were very high quality. The MB Text seats were traditional ""Benz Rock Hard.""The salesman promptly offered me a test drive, which I declined until we ran the numbers. So once he taylored the lease figures to meet my needs: 15K per year for 3 years, $0 Cap Cost Reduction, MB Maintenance (residualized in the lease), sales tax, the payment became $460 per month.

MPG's and legroom are great but so is performance and looks -- I would put this new TL on par with the buick/lexus ES category except they are better looking cars-- i think the real comparison should be the lincoln mkz-- both are larger then entry level sedans, 40k and offer an upgrade engine that only really come in automatics (one in 6k Tl's sold comes in manuals/have yet to find one here on edmunds). They are both middle of the road performance sedans (look at the reviews)/The G does eat gas for sure-(i get 18mpg most fillups)-and the reason why you see more G's is because they trounce acura TL in sales. (billy i posted the numbers on another chat) To knock the auto is a joke because the TL has a 5 speed auto from the accord.-- and if you see one on a rental lot you should rent it and flog the snap out of it.. Facts are facts, good safe play for a person who is looking for a good lease deal but its not going to win any performance awards other then 5 star crash safety. "

"jtla","August 2010"," sween, if I remember correctly, you have the 2008 G35, right? The 7AT in the 2009+ improves the mileage notably. The EPA rating for the 2010 G37 sedan is 19 city/27 highway. In real world, I can get 21 MPG average on 40/60 city/hwy. I think it is pretty good for a 328 HP performance sedan. As to the 7-speed transmission, I did not experience the ""gear hunting"" some people mentioned here. In the ""D"" mode, it has adapted to my driving style and shifts at higher RPM than in the break-in period. Occasionally I will use the paddle-shifters to down shift for highway passing. IMO, the combination of 7AT and the paddle-shifter is about the best you can get -- short of manual tranny. "
"sweendogy","August 2010"," billy, good comeback.. always insightful with tons of facts, smart people should also look at the sales numbers and performance numbers-- but i do agree with you that safety is important as well.JTLA- yeah i have the old 5speed auto-- wish it had 2 more gears but cant justify trading in a car thats paid for and has no miles on it for extra 2-3 mpg. "
"marcus216","August 2010"," I respectfully disagree regarding performance of the TL against other premium performance sedans. My neighbor has a 2009 BMW 535 IX and I have driven his car and he has driven mine. Acceleration in a bit better in the BMW, but not much and my TL handles almost as well as his BMW. Now, am I saying that the TL is a better performing car, no. But it is fairly close. So to say that the TL is better compared to a Buick or Lincoln than a 5 Series is, in my opinion just not accurate. "
"jtla","August 2010"," Certainly no need to trade in a 2008 for a 2010. They are still basically the same car. The point I was trying to make was that the G, especially the current model year, is not nearly as gasoline thirsty as some may think. "

"sweendogy","August 2010"," your free to have an opinion -- and I do think the TL has its good points vs BMW (one big one being price for sure) but its blood lines dont make it a true performer (thats why it NEVER wins in comparo tests)--- its an accord (not a bad thing, billy loves its safe nature, and lord knows its a proven platform)what about the lincoln mks with awd and the SHO engine-- 350/350 hp/torque vs 305/265.. 6speed vs 5, both big and have pushed the styling to the obsurd.. i would bet the acura handles a little better but the MKS can park itself..Buick offers the LaCross CXS which if you look close tops the base acura TL in HP--has a 6speed auto and starts at 29kk (which is 6k cheaper then base TL) and if you put the cars sidebyside (exterior) and took the badges off you would think the buick was more money.

"billyperks2","August 2010"," Okay let me try and understand what you are saying.Before you go out to purchase an automobile you research how many units been sold and the performance of the car.So basically you are telling me if the Pontiac Aztec sold a zillion units, returned a time of 0-60 in 3.2 secs, skid pad 0.84g and braking from 0-60 at 112ft - you have to get one? oh really?I thought normal people picked their cars by their taste, budget and what fits their lifestyle. Secondly you keep harping on the 5 speed auto- what's wrong with it? Do you think 15 gears make a car better? I think the gear ratios are remarkable in the TL- at 85mph my tach is hardly at the 2500 RPM. Try doing 85mph on your G, probably you will be cranking 4000rpm easily.When will Nissan- oh I mean Infiniti get their math correct? Can they make a car that does not harm the enviroment- all that gas guzzling just destroys the ozone-GOSH, get it right Maxima- oh, I mean G35. "
"marcus216","August 2010"," Bloodlines in automobiles don't really mean much to me. How a 2000 BMW 5 Series compared to a 2000 TL does not apply to how current models compare to each other. BMW 5 Series has always been the standard bearer for luxury performance sedans. My point is that my 2010 TL SH-AWD compares very well to a 2010 BMW 535IX in acceleration, handling, over all drving dynamics, interior appointments, and build quality. One can call the TL and ""entry level"" performance sedan because of the price point, but in real world driving, it measures up quite well. Regarding the Buick Lacrosse, I looked at it when I was car shopping. I would call the LaCrosse and ""entry level' luxury sedan. It is more Lexus like. It is a comforable highway cruising car with a great interior, decent handling and driving dynamics. It has a totally different feel than a 5 Series or TL SH-AWD. And probably appeals to a different buyer. I was looking for performance more than luxury and TL delivers in that department quite well.FYI, I also shopped the Taurus SHO. Now that was an interesting car. Extremely large, but drove much smaller. Absolutely killer engine. Nice interior and the Ford SYNC system is great.

Same engine is in the Quest, Altima and the rest of the family.So I dont know why G owners think the G is apart from the Nissan family. "
"billyperks2","August 2010"," Some times you get the hunch to defend your vehicle but I guess you are right- why stoop? "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Listen, I'm kinda of in the middle of this b/c I have a TL (3G), a Infiniti, and the new Maxima. Having vehicles from all three makes, each automaker has pros and cons compared to the other one. One isn't dramatically better then the other. They each do certain things better than the other so it's just a matter of what things your really want or are willing to sacrifice. I'm just trying to keep the peace I guess. "
"kfdmed","August 2010"," But the G is RWD/AWD vs. FWD Maxima and has a 7-speed vs. CVT. Given the choice I would take a TL SH-AWD first, a G37X second, Maxima third and a base TL fourth if money was no object. I have a limited budget so the Maxima worked for me best. I liked the interior size of the TL except for the trunk size over the G37X. The G is a bit cramped inside. The Maxima has the best overall style inside and out and is just the right size ... and it has the superior glove box .... it's huge.  "
"jtla","August 2010"," smarty, I am with you on this. Keep your cool, billy.I owned both Maxima and Accord in the past, and bought a 2010 G37S in March -- would have chosen TL SH-AWD had it been the same size as the 3G TL. Personally, I like the intimate feel in a cabin. Some may think the interior of G37 is cramped, but coming from a 2007 BMW 328i, it feels spacious to me.A friend of mine is considering the BMW 5-series, but I strongly recommend the TL to him and save the $10k-$15k. I think I almost sounded like a Acura salesperson.There isn't any bad car in this class, just personal preference. "

"2233","August 2010"," Through the years I've owned a Toyota Supra, an Acura TL, Acura CL, an Acura MDX and a 2004 Infiniti G35 and my wife has a 2007 G35. Owned several Accords and a Prelude. All nice cars.However, the transmissions went out after the warranty on the TL and the MDX. We had a great deal of problems with the CL. The transmission went out on my brother's MDX and his Accord. All of these transmission blow ups occurred shortly after the extended warranty ended.Older Accords were bulletproof and unbelievably reliable. Transmission problems there now too.The Infinitis are fun to drive, reliable, great looking, and reasonably priced. MPG suffer a bit but it's not bad. Their AWD is amazing and the car is 100% rear wheel drive unless it detects a need to use the front wheelsWhen the new body style on the G37 sedan comes out in a year or two, I will be one of the first in line to test drive it. "
"2233","August 2010"," I forgot to mention another important point.Infinitis (and Nissans) have timing chains. Hondas And Acuras have timing belts.Timing belts are $600-800 to replace and if they break, it probably will cost you a new engine.Timing chains are virtually indestructible. "
"fedlawman","August 2010"," Not all Honda/Acuras have timing belts. For example, the RDX and 4 cylinder TSX use a timing chain.Even though the timing chains are generally lifetime items, one should replace tensioners and guides every 100,000 miles. The Infiniti uses 3 timing chains, and replacing the tensioners and guides involves removing the exhaust, starter, AC compressor and upper oil pan - about 11 book hours. How much do you think your dealer will charge for that?!?! "
"2233","August 2010"," I wasn't aware that the 4 cyl TSX and the RSX use a timing chain.I've never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing. It may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens. Timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace. If the timing belt breaks while you are operating the vehicle, a new engine will generally be required. I've heard of many timing belts breaking which cause at minimum a bent valve, a hole in your piston or a need for a total engine overhaul.If you are lucky and your Acura timing belt does not break, you can use the money you save to buy a new transmission. Check the Acura posts if you don't believe me. "
"duke39","August 2010"," Until Acura gets the transmission issues of the MDX, RL, and TL resolved, I would never consider an Acura.Many TLs are on their 3rd transmission according to this Edmunds site. "

You'll only pay $600 if you include a new tensioner, idler pulley, serpentine belt, and water pump.Have you priced new tensioners, guides, serpentine belt, and water pump for the Infiniti?  "
"2233","August 2010"," The Acura's with timing belts are interference types which means you will likely need a new engine if your belt breaks. Not so with chains.Have you priced new engines for an Acura?How about new transmissions for an Acura?. "

People with 2006+ model years are not running into transmission issues like you guys are trying to imply. Go and check CR's reliability history charts for all the Acura models and you'll see that. Starting with the 2006 model years, the transmissions got above avg or much above avg ratings. If you look at the charts, the black dots for transmission issues were for 2004 model year and earlier. I have had two TL's so far, one which had a lot of miles on it, and had absolutely no issues. Get your facts straight before you go bad mouthing an entire brand. To anyone else, if you get an Acura model 2006+, you'll have little to no worry about transmission issues. Very very reliable vehicles. "
"2233","August 2010"," I guess you neglected to check the Acura transmission problem section on Edmunds.There are many posts about transmission and clutch problems in 2006 vehicles, not just 2005 and prior models.Remember, it took several years before the transmission problems surfaced regarding the transmission failures of TLs from 1999-2005. Now the problems with the 2006 transmissions are surfacing. Next year we may hear about problems from 2007.Acura's customer service and care are terrible at the national level also. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Trust me, Acura customer service is ten times better than anything I've gotten from both Infiniti or Nissan when I've had a issue, question, or warranty problem that needed to be addressed. Acura at least pretends like they care, even if in the end, they can't help you out. Nissan/Infiniti on the other hand just flat out won't believe you and tells you anything wrong with your vehicle is normal. The customer service treatment I received from GM for almost 30 years was an abomination to say the least. Acura might not be as high as Caddy, Jaguar, or Lexus for customer service but trust me, there are much worse customer service from other companies out there! Just remember, the population sample of edmunds reports is a small minority of the total owners who have Acura vehicles and we don't here from the vast majority of Acura owners on edmunds, only a small group, sometimes only a few hundred, out of the hundreds of thousands of Acura owners. Doesn't mean there isn't a problem, but you have to take the sample size of problems with a grain of salt and try not to paint a broad brush, as your trying to do, that all Acura's are bad products. You can make this same point with any automakers and their specific problems you here complained and reported here on edmunds and then paint a broad brush about the entire automaker and try to frighten people not to get those brands: GM: numerous power steering and airbag issues in various modelsHonda: brake/rotor issues on several models Toyota/Lexus: acceleration, transmission, and safety issues Nissan: early gen CVT issues BMW: numerous electrical/sensor issues that need to be fixed Chrysler: various mechanical/safety issues across the boardInfiniti: hunting/pecking and communication issues with transmission/computerAudi: some mechanical/electrical gremlins in a more than avg chunk of its modelsthe list can go on and on for each automaker and the point is, you take your chances with anyone of them; it just depends on, what one gives you a slightly higher chance of not getting a problem model from that automaker I can tell you with having two Acura's both 2006+ that I have had no problems or no sign of problems with my transmission and I don't know anyone personally with a Honda or Acura model that has or has had transmission issues; I belong to a few Acura boards and the MAJORITY do not have transmission issues; I only have seen a few dozen over the years on those boards report transmission issues, not that they can't happen, but they are not happening left and right with every Acura model and in the intensity your trying to portray it as!

"xeye","August 2010"," ""Acura's customer service and care are terrible at the national level also. ""I went to test drive a TL-Type S in January 2007 in Framingham, MA. The roads were clear and dry during a spell of unusually warm weather in the 70's. The torque steer was surprisingly difficult to handle to the point where I dismissed the car as an undisciplined and poorly designed automobile. Nicely appointed, but dangerous to drive aggressively.What really turned me off, though, was the attitude of the salesman who took me for the drive. Upon returning to the showroom, I wanted to know more about the vehicle and asked for the detailed brochure as I like to devour the technical details and be able to imagine myself behind the wheel. The salesman told me they didn't have any brochures, that I wasn't ready to buy and to come back when I was ready. He was arrogant and rude. He then promptly walked away leaving me thoroughly unattended.That turned me off Acuras so completely that I wouldn't even consider another dealership. Too bad as this one was less than 1 mile from my home.I then went to a local BMW dealership that I had avoided as I didn't think I could afford a BMW. I did a test drive of the 335xi. I was so impressed by the car, but more importantly, the manner of the salesman and the time he took to chat with me over the next 7 months when I would drop by that we are now on our 3rd BMW from the same dealership. ('07 335xi traded for an '11 335i xDrive, and my wife's '08 328xi).Acura? No thanks. "

"2233","August 2010"," Trust me, I've had much better customer service with Infiniti. I guess it comes down to the individual dealership so this can vary from city to city.All I know is that we had 3 Acuras and all 3 had the transmissions go out. That's my experience. Around 2003, my brother and I went shopping for an MDX for him. We asked about the reported transmission problems in the TLs from 2000 and 2001. The salesman was adamant that the problem only existed in the early 1999 and 2000 transmission in the TL. He indicated that there were no problems in the later TLs and never in the MDX.Guess what? My brothers MDX's transmission went out last year. Now we see 2006 transmission problems with the TL. Keep us posted in a couple of years on your TL or an MDX if you own one. It takes 4 years for this problem to manifest itself and become public. I am in contact with the NHTSA re any deaths or injuries from the TL trans failures.Hopefully you will be lucky. My family is batting 1000 with 3 for 3 transmission failures. "

They were all replaced with rebuilt versions...they presumably still had the design defect.I assumed that the new versions were re-designed and 'good' now...who knows, maybe their failure rate was the same as others and the owners are just more vocal.I maybe wrong in my assumptions...but I'd be pretty PO'd if any transmission went out...at anytime throughout the life of the vehicle; of course with the caveat that you're not at the drag strip or towing 10k lbs everyday...

How the manufacturer resolves these problems is what is crucial.I complained for 5 years about the transmission in my TL, Acura only performed a jet kit quick service of some sort. That's it. Complained constantly about the other 2 also that went out. Acura refused to replace these unless they went out during the warranty period.My daughter drove the TL and constantly called me worrying that she would not make it to her destination and would break down on an expressway. This eventually happened. Acura could have replaced this transmission with a rebuilt one and that would have satisfied me but they chose not to do so, An Acura rep in California named Ingrid took 11 days to tell me they would pay for 10% of the repair after the TL trans went out. That was insulting and waiting 11 days was inconsiderate at best.My 2004 Infiniti G35 had a well known problem with the brake pads wearing out prematurely. However, they were proactive. After I had 35,000 miles on the vehicle they contacted me and put 4 new pads and new front rotors on the car at their expense. They even gave me a free loaner and an oil change.At 68,000 miles I took the G35 into Infiniti of Ann Arbor and reported that rear rotors may need turning. I mentioned the pads and rear rotor replacement from 3 years earlier. They called Infiniti and gave me 4 new pads, turned the front rotors and replaced the rears at no cost.

The service advisor said they just received a TSB indicating that a problem with the front splash guards may have caused warping of the front rotors. They replaced the front splash guards and turned the front rotors at no cost.This is truly great service. This is what we experienced with Infiniti.Disregarding constant complaints and arrogance is what we got from Acura, in addition to 3 blown transmission between my brother and us.None of us ever towed a thing nor did we abuse the Acuras in any way.

"smarty666","August 2010"," When I got my new Maxima last year, the auto up features on the front windows did not work at all. After two visits to the Nissan stealers and being told they worked fine and that it was MY FAULT they wouldn't go up in the way I was pushing the button, I called Nissan Consumer Affairs. I reported the problem to them, and without even asking me any details, they too tried to blame me and say I was not pushing the button correctly. They then went behind my back, called the stealer where I took the car and then called me back saying they talked to the stealer and they couldn't find anything wrong. About a week went by and I did some of my own research online and found a TSB put out by Nissan for the auto-up feature not working on the Maxima and what needed to be done to correct it. Printed out the TSB and took it into the stealer on the third trip, gave them the paper and threatened to get the stealership owner involved if they did not address the issue. Suffice it to say, third time was the charm on such a ridiculously non-complicated issue that both the Nissan stealer and Nissan Consumer Affairs could have addressed but do to their idiotic and poor customer service I was dismissed and blamed for my warranty problem. Doesn't get any worse then that. Never have had Acura stealer blame me for a warranty or issue on my vehicles yet.I've got 2 or 3 more issues I could describe but this specific one above is enough to illustrate my point. :shades: "
"smarty666","August 2010"," You know why you didn't have any troubles with Infiniti in regards to your brake and rotor issues, b/c I went through the same thing with them on my 2005 FX35. Every 10k miles, I had to have my brakes replaced and rotors resurfaced b/c how poorly they were made/grinded together. When ever I applied the brakes, I had this terrible grinding/shimmy through the pedals and wheels, which always indicated to me I was nearing the 10k mile mark for another Infiniti stealer visit. Luckily it was all covered under warranty which I never could understand b/c most automakers consider brake/rotor wear a normal wear and tear item which is not covered under warranty. Come to find out, there were multiple class action lawsuits against Infiniti for poor brake/rotor problems that people with early year G35 and FX35/45 vehicles had. Infiniti was not covering the brakes and rotor repairs even for people that had their brakes and rotors shot to hell after only 6-7k miles on them. Enough people sued and Infiniti was forced to settle and cover the brake and rotor repairs under warranty. It wasn't until Infiniti was forced to do the right thing that they actually stepped up and did it! Thats the reason why all those issues you had were covered under warranty at no cost to you. Enough people had problems and sued to get that stuff covered. Shame is, Infiniti continued to put poor quality brake/rotors on their vehicles all the way up to 2008 models. I've only recently seen signs that the issues on their models have changed with a changed to better quality brake/rotors on their 2009+ models and the frequency and occurrence of brake/rotor issues has dropped dramatically since the change in parts in 2009!

"2233","August 2010"," Infiniti stepped up with me and replaced a second set of pads and rotors. The terms of the class action suit did not require this nor were they required to do anything on the 2007 Infiniti. That is the difference between Acura and Infiniti in my experience. I am commenting only on my experiences with these 2 companies. IInfiniti has resolved their issues. Has Acura?If you checked my other posts re this issue, my extended family was about as loyal to Acura/Honda as anyone in this country. I owned a total of 8 Honda/Acuras, my parents owned 2, and my 3 brothers owned a total of about 10. My brother worked for Enterprise Car Rental and purchased over 50 Hondas from our local dealership.My driveway looked like a Acura/Honda dealership at Thanksgiving. You would think that Acura would be a little accomodating and pay for half of my transmission repair. It might have cost them $1,000.My brother is shopping for SUVs as we speak and he has eliminated Honda/Acura in his search. I just bought an Altima Friday for my daughter. My other brother is looking for a sedan and has also eliminated this brand.That's 3 lost sales in 3 weeks and more lost sales are forthcoming.Good move Acura. "

"smarty666","August 2010"," I'd suggest you re-read the class action lawsuit b/c it DOES REQUIRE them to replace the brakes and rotors on the opposite axle to the drive under warranty! Since the G35 and FX35 in my case, was RWD, this covered the front brakes/rotors. I had them replaced and resurfaced for free at 10k, 20k, 30k, and 40k. Thats four times! When the rear brakes/rotors started having troubles at 20k, was told by TWO SEPARATE Infiniti stealers that, ""oh, the rear's were not covered under the class action suit b/c the vehicles were RWD!"" Called Infiniti headquarters who only confirmed what the stealers told me and despite all my problems with the fronts, even though I was still under warranty would do nothing to help pay for the rear brakes/rotors. Yeah, great customer service! Infiniti does not step up to the plate when it truly matters! That is why they are ranked at the bottom of the luxury customer service list by JD Power! No matter what automaker, you shouldn't be having brake/rotor issues at those kind of low miles anyway if they are made and put together properly. What is sad is that Infiniti could not step up to the plate until being legally forced to and actually had the nerve to tell 2003-2006 G35 and 2003-2006 FX owners that they had to pay out of pocket for brakes/rotors being shot at 7-10k miles as NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR!We used to have a lot of Nissan/Infiniti in my family, like you did with Honda/Acura and none so far have gone back to Infiniti and replaced them with Acura's, Lexus's, and BMW's.

"duke39","August 2010"," I test drove the new TL last yearThe torque steer in the TL was so bad that I felt that I affected my control of the vehicle when it was driven aggressively.The TL tries to portray itself as a performance luxury car but it can never be a performance car with all the torque steer. If you never drive in a sporty and aggressive manner then the torque steer will not matter. But if your hoping to have a fun vehicle to drive, there are much better choices out there.A car with this much power cannot effectively use the front wheels for steering, handling and delivering power to the front end. I found the handling way too jittery. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," I've felt some torque steer but nothing to the dramatic extent your describing. It is easy to compensate for by just having two hands on the wheel when accelerating fast. Its not perfect but its not terrible either. I have the 3G Base so I can only speak for that vehicle. The Type-S had the bigger engine and displacement so I assume maybe that could have more severe torque steer. One thing I give Nissan credit for in the new Maxima, is they have virtually eliminated torque steer. A pretty impressive feet for a car with 290HP/261 lbs of torque in a FWD set-up. I have felt little to none under brisk acceleration since having it. Can't speak for the new TL since I don't have one if Acura was able to improve upon that compared to the last Gen TL. "
"2233","August 2010"," smarty 666,My point was that Infiniti made several repairs to our vehicles after the warranty expired and well after any mandate required them to do.Acura did not. Their refusal to equitably share in the repairs of the transmission occurred after we presented, in wiriting and in great detail, our documented complaints over 5 years on this transmission.This is my experience. Yours may be different. It seems we are both ""car guys"" with differing experiences who can engage in lively discussions but with different opinions.Acura is clearly having sales problems with their TL. That is not in dispute. Hopefully these discussion are read by them and they can return Acura to their prior level of quality and desirability. Hopefully Acura, Infiniti, BMW, et al read these posts and attempt to improve their transmissions, brakes, engines etc and provide better and safer cars for their customers.Loyalty is important to me and my extended family and it should run both ways. I'm sure you feel the same way. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," Couldn't agree with your last post more! I personally, after seeing first hand how the sales animals treat you, have no brand loyalty. I go where ever I like the vehicles, get the best price, treatment, etc. B/C at the end of the day, there is no brand loyalty. When you walk in to the salesman, no matter how long you've been with them, they treat you as if your there for the first time and try to screw you over. I've had it time and time again with multiple automakers.I'm sorry to hear Acura was not willing to step up and back you up. Its quite a shame. I had the same experience with Infiniti not stepping up and helping me so I guess we were the victims of the same mistreatment, just by different companies! It is a shame with the sales figures of the new TL. I too was turned away from getting one, b/c of the size increase and ugly grill, hence why I got a new Maxima, so hopefully they get the message on that one and the next gen TL will be back on track. So far, my Maxima has been fun to drive, and after 12k miles, I'm happy to say, no rotor/brake issues like I have on my FX35! Its a good thing for the class action lawsuit so that all my brake/rotor fixes were covered b/c that would have added up quickly and really hurt the bank.I'm glad, though I can't understand why it took Nissan and Infiniti over 5 years to finally put the proper type of brakes and rotors on their vehicles, that they finally have had their brake/rotor issues solved. Before 2009, it was a really serious problem on both Infiniti and Nissan vehicles. I know the 2007 and 2008 Altima's had major troubles with wear as well, but so far, since 2009 model years, I've read very few brake/rotor issues compared to years previous! It only goes to help us! "
"2233","August 2010"," I really like the new Maxima. It resembles the M37 a great deal. I didn't test drive one when searching for a car for my daughter since it was priced higher than the Altima but it's alot less expensive than the M37.Infinti's brake issues existed from 2003 to 2006 in the G. They changed the design and the pad for the 2007 model and no problems with my wife's 2007. I'm not up to speed on the FX though.I'm looking for a new car in 2011 or 2012. I think the FX is the best looking SUV ever made but some find it not attractive. Speaking of sleazy salesmen, we test drove a Camry last week also. The salesman knew me somewhat for many years having sold me a Toyotal Supra back in the 90s. He knew that I was an informed consumer.When we spoke about price, I mentioned that the dealership of a competing brand was cutting the holdback and crediting it to us in their price. He first said he never heard of ""holdback"" and when I chuckled he later said Toyota only pays $200 for holdback.I corrected him and informed him that the holdback was more than double that.We walked out. You'd think that an experienced Toyota salesman would have more sense and class but I guess I give some car salemen too much credit. "
"ctl","August 2010"," A potential TL buyer here. I would think the TL auto trans. issue is history by now, after all, they have been on the same 5 speed all these time! one would think... I wish for the new 6 speed but is a bit worried, almost everyone (benz 7, infiniti 7, toyota 6, has had issue with their newer version of auto trans when it first came out.Funny all the bittering on infiniti brake pad... now all the issues with 2008-2009 Accord brake pads (consistantly short lived, avg. 20K) makes me wonder about the TL brake pads. Haven't heard much about it yet, but watching closely. "
"2233","August 2010"," I would wait until the current body style of the TL is out for at least 4 years to assess the potential transmission issues.Remember, the 2000 + TLs took about 4 years to manifest themselves as did the MDX. "

"sweendogy","August 2010"," comments on CR reliability charts and dealership experinace==On consumer reports-- I use them for almost everything I buy, from Toasters, Tvs and cars-- i think its a great paid service that does have merit. The break and transmission issues on both the tl and infiniti-- its all about luck when getting a car - most cars have something thats going to be problem (or reported as a problem by the owners)-- no one builds a perfect car (but the accord/civic have been close).On dealerships-- well i''ve owned both acura and infiniti.. Acura has a better overall setup and you feel wanted when you drop your car off -(2 dealerships i've visited, for oilchanges only, dam i miss the GS-R)- this is my Infiniti -- well i bought my G35 at a small dealership in the middle of nowhere and they have great service but the larger in-town dealership is cold, mass marketed, non-user friendly monster. I think its more about who owns the dealership and where its located. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," As far as I know, the brake/rotor wear issues are mostly contained to the 2008-2010 Accord. I haven't heard similar problems with the 2009+ TL which I believe uses different pads/rotors from the Accord. Don't quote me on that since I don't have the new TL and not sure what was changed or not changed. But I know that current gen Accord owners are going through hell with Honda on the brake/rotor issues and Honda has not done a great job of stepping up and helping people until being forced to legally or with severe pressure from corporate Honda. Such a shame. From my own experience, both my 2006 and 2008 TL have had absolutely no brake/rotor issues at all. "

"ctl","August 2010"," The current TL auto-trans 5speed is the same one Honda used across the board (RL, TL, Accord, Civic...), since 2000 TL! On one hand they would probably have made it to perfection by now. On the other, one would think they have extincted by now, lagging behind virtually the whole industry in the transmission area! Amazing stubbornness or confidence? :mad: maybe also they were bite hard by the early trans. issue and being cautious.As to the brake pad, if I have to bet, I would take that they share the design and parts with Account, at least the FWD version. Will be great if they didn't, but the jury is still out on this one. "

I just didn't have a lifestyle then that made it matter. "
"smarty666","August 2010"," I know exactly what your going through kristie and I feel for you. Its such a shame b/c except for the brake/rotor issues, my FX35 has been flawless and such a blast to have and drive! Luckily, all the repairs were covered under warranty by Infiniti, after the lawsuits of course, but so far, since 2009, I've read very few complaints from G and FX owners having brake/rotor issues. For 2009, Infiniti put different pads/rotors on which so far looks like solved the problems from 2003-2008 model years. Wish it didn't have to take that long but it is what it is. Sad to see Honda is doing the same thing to its Accord customers now! "

I dont have the problem in the snow due to the fact my car is the awd-- i'm assuming you have the RWD if so it prob would handle better in the snow with a good set of snow tires.my only other grip is the MPGS- "
"Kirstie_H","August 2010"," Mine has 106K on it, so I doubt anyone will cover anything under warranty. And, considering I haven't spent a dime on the vehicle in repairs (just maintenance, wear-and-tear items), the brake issue is relatively acceptable.It's not the reason I'm likely trading in, but the snow issue is. I used to live in a suburban area, with restaurants, a bar, grocery store, and movie rental place less than 0.2 miles away - easy walking. Now I live in a more country-like setting, with nothing in walking distance, and the roads in the area just aren't great, nor do they get plowed well. Better tires would help, but not enough. 2 of our 3 vehicles don't go anywhere when it snows (both RWD), so I'm considering trading in before Winter hits. Last year was one of the 3 snowiest years on record here, so that's probably affecting my decision.MPGs aren't fantastic, but I currently do so little driving that it isn't a big deal. "
"pv2","August 2010"," Since you have a manual transmission, your car probably came with summer performance tires which are useless in the snow. Suggest you change to an all season performance tire. I have an '07 TL-S with auto, so it came with Michelin HX-MXMV all season performance tires and they work well in anything under a 6 inch snowfall. The other alternative is to havea separate set of winter tires and rims, but that can be expensive. You'll be sacrificing a tiny bit of dry performance at the limit, but that shouldn't be a big issue unless you drive very aggressily. Good luck. "
"Kirstie_H","August 2010"," It's an auto, and I did change the tires. I've had it since 2006, and it's been a great car. In fact, I've owned few, if any, cars for this long, so it doesn't bother me to start thinking about trading. Even *if* I could get it to perform OK in snow, I'd still prefer something that performs *well* in snow. Plus, we're kind of looking to make mine the ""middle car"" balance. We've got a Crossfire and a giant pick-up truck, which will likely be traded in on an even more giant pick-up truck. I'll probably looking at something that is AWD and can do some very light (waverunner) towing, but if that happens, I'll not bore this discussion's members with it. "

There are reasons that those badges have certain reputations. As a former Audi owner and a current Acura owner, I can tell you that the Acura has been a LOT more reliable than the Audi. But do you know what? I MISS the Audi. It inspired more passion as its interior was nicer, its handling was better, and it was more solid. But it was less reliable and cost a lot more to fix. Sit in a Mercedes and then sit in an Acura. Can you feel the difference? I can. (and no, I've never owned a MB). Different people have different preferences. Some might want reliability or more tech gadgets. Others might want better leather or a more solid feeling or a better handling drive.

"jimbres","September 2010"," I have an '01 BMW 330i that I bought new in June of that year. Since the factory warranty ran out, in June 2005, I've spent a grand total of $1200 on unscheduled repairs. (Most of that went toward replacing a control arm, after I drove into the biggest pothole on the East Coast. Can't really blame that on the car.)That works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. I spend more than that on coffee.You'll find that the 3-series is a very reliable car, particularly when it's equipped according to God's wishes - with a stick. "
"billyperks2","September 2010"," Agree. "
"nyccarguy","September 2010"," About BMWs being unreliable and expensive to fix/maintain is just plain absurd. Not every car is perfect. For heaven's sake, my brother in law's Civic just had to have the engine replaced after it overheated, oil started gushing out from underneath it, and ceased (he's fanatical about preventitive maintenance). Should he go into the Civic forum here on edmunds and say how unreliable they are.Yes, Acura gives you more bang for the buck if you are a tech guy. But the TSX is cheaper because it is built on a FWD Honda Accord chassis. A 3 series is built on a dedicated RWD platform which is more expensive to build & design.Yes some people buy BMWs, MBs, Audis, Lexuses, Infinitis, Acuras... for the badges, but there are many who do drive them because there is a noticable difference in the steering, the brakes, the handling, the responsiveness. "
"smarty666","September 2010"," I wasn't trying to make it out that prestige was the only reason but in regards to BMW and MB, when they are similarly equipped/packaged to their Acura, Infiniti, or even Audi counterparts are chosen a lot for the prestige factor for those thousands of dollars extra. For many, its not the only reason as you pointed out. For BMW, it could be for a combo of prestige and sport performance/dynamics as to why they chose their vehicle or say for a MB it could be a combo of prestige and luxury comfort. Personally, Audi to me, has sales similar still to Acura and Infiniti in quantity but even Audi is different from MB and BMW in that like the japanese, they have nicely priced trim levels that include a whole bunch of features so that you don't have to get really expensive option packages or pay extra for each luxury feature you want. But then again, you have the reliability factor with them so your right that there a huge set of factors, prestige being just one of them, to consider with each luxury automaker. I've found out recently over the years, customer service at the dealership and headquarter levels is coming into a sales factor for me because some of the companies are terrible where as others are great. "
"sweendogy","September 2010"," From the sales numbers it doesn't look like many people are buying acuras at all- regardless of prestige factor you speak of. I think for 75% of these cars (in this chat) bought new are traded in within 5 years so I think the reliability factor should be discounted-unless you are looking at used. Most come with 4yr earrantee. Most keep value well regardless of reliability in this group.I think if your looking to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. A 40k BMW 335 is not going to give you the same options as a TL but will give you better performance. It's all what your looking for - performance or convenience. On a side note I think audi a4's are way overpriced for size and performance. "
"roadburner","September 2010"," That works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. I spend more than that on coffee. My 1995 3 Series has 121,000 miles on it and the cost of scheduled maintenance and repairs(including four sets of summer/track rubber) averages a bit under 5 cents per mile. As for my wife's 2004 X3 2.5, at 101,000 miles the sole unscheduled repair has been a bad passenger SRS sensor- which was replaced under warranty. Maintenance costs are again averaging @5 cents per mile, and that takes into account the fact that I change the oil and filter twice as often as the SI system calls for. I better be looking for a good Chapter 7 attorney... :P In contrast, my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 has 64,000 miles on it and it has needed a LF strut, a turbocharger, and a VVT Actuator- all before it hit 50,000 miles.

"shipo","September 2010"," Let's see here, forgetting for a moment that the NSX in 2005 cost well over twice the price of a 2011 335i, comparing a purpose built two-seat sports car to a four-door family/sports sedan isn't a terribly relevant exercise. That said, my bet is that a 2011 335i SP will take it to the NSX on any number of tracks, maybe even the majority of tracks. I mean geez, a couple of years ago Honda sponsored a race on a tight road course in Japan to compare their various performance cars, and a JDM Civic SI gave the NSX all it could handle. In the end, the NSX would run away on the straights and the Civic would just reel it back in on the twisty bits. "

"smarty666","September 2010"," If you had read the second post I put up, I said prestige was not the sole and only factor but it has a lot to do with the BMW and MB choices. If you don't think so then your just kidding yourself and if you looked closely at what I was comparing and talking about it was vehicles that were comparably equipped between the German and Japanese automakers. That means, same size engines, features, technology, etc. The Germans are always going to cost a few thousand more. It is more a statement of fact then opinion. That is just the way it is. Your absolutely right that Acura currently has lacked in the hardcore sport performance offerings of RWD and V8 but not every body needs that. I certainly have no issues with performance out of my 3G TL's but not everyone is so happy and wants more. If you want sport performance with a V8 and RWD go get a BMW or Infiniti, plain and simple. That is why there are choices in the luxury market. "

The critical major systems - engine, transmission, fuel system, electrical system, etc. - get mostly ""Much Better than Average"", with a few getting ""Better than Average"".

"edwardsf","September 2010"," Interesting post. A lot of strong conclusions claiming ""fact"" without any data, even opinion surveys. I bought a 3 series recently after owning an A4, and a couple of Saab 900s. I bought these previous cars after testing TLs and G35s. I certainly thought the Japanese cars were as good looking and I liked the idea of owning a less blingy, more reliable car. But I like the road feel of the European cars so I bought the Euromobiles even though they did not have as many standard toys. I never tested a Bimmer in these 3 shopping trips because I think there has been a stigma or stereotype of a haughty jerk that is connected with Bimmer drivers. So, for me at least, the BMW image was a turnoff. But I have a hearing loss and now need a quieter car. So I tested more cars this time, including the A4, TL, CC, IS, ES, and the C300. And the 3 series, even though I think the 328 sedan is the least attractive of all these cars, especially the gorgeous C and G. Not only was the 3 series quieter than all but the land yacht ES, it handled better than the C300 and the A4. It handled much better than the TL, ES and IS. The G37 had similar handling. And the 328 had better ergonomics for a 6-3 guy and better highway gas mileage/emissions than all the other cars. As another poster mentioned, the 328/325 has better Consumer Reports repair ratings than A4 and C300 and the same ratings as the Japanese cars, except for the land yacht. I bought a three year used 328i for about 50% off original MSRP. I got over the image. The bad one that is. "
"smarty666","September 2010"," Again, no body looks at all the post and picks and choose what they want to nit pick on; It is a FACT, German automobiles cost more than their Japanese counter parts with the same equipment, etc. I'm not saying nor did I say that was a bad thing, its just the way it is. All I ever mentioned was the word prestige and how that contributes a lot to German luxury sales. I did say that was not the sole and only reason that people buy German vehicles but many on here seem to have missed that. I even mentioned BMW performance/handling as a key factor in conjunction with the BMW badge as reasons why they are so successful. You as well have strong conclusions claiming ""facts"" about the 3-Series without any data. Don't get me wrong, the 3-Series is a great car but, it doesn't have better city or highway gas mileage then all those other vehicles you test drove and I find it hard to believe it has the best ergonomics for a tall person considering there are other vehicles in that class with more front headroom then the 328 where when your taller, headroom makes the most difference. Not saying the 3-Series is a bad car, it certainly has several pros over some of the other entry-level lux sedans but not in those areas you mentioned. 328i 19/28 mpg (F/R Headroom 38.5''/37.5'')G37 19/27mpg (F/R Headroom 39.1""/37.2"")A4 22/30mpg (F/R Headroom 40.0''/37.5'')C300 18/26mpg (F/R Headroom 37.1''/36.9'') TL 18/26mpg (F/R Headroom 38.4''/36.7'') IS250 21/30mpg (F/R Headroom 37.2''/36.7'')ES350 19/27mpg (F/R Headroom 37.8''/37.0'')I'm not saying I only get Japanese luxury vehicles because that couldn't be further from the truth. I've had Acura, Infiniti, Mercedes, and a Caddy so far. Unless Acura changes direction, I'll most likely be shopping Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, and Audi the next time around. "

I like the Acura I have, but nothing really from their current product line. That is not new news and not the first time I've mentioned it on here. "
"edwardsf","September 2010"," Easy now. The main message you have been communicating in many of your posts is the following: ""prestige and how that contributes a lot to German luxury sales."" And over and over. But... you cite no data to support that oft repeated claim. That is my point. Not the other strawmen you bring up. And what exactly is a ""strong"" conclusion? I made some statements such as the ergonomics are better for a 6-3 guy than the other cars. Um, okay. I got in the cars and moved the seats around. I fit in the BMW much better than any of the cars, including the A4, which I actually owned. So, the manufacturers specs are relatively meaningless. For all its warts, CR does try to deal with the manufacturer discrepancies by trying to compensate for them. But even CR does not account for sloping roof tops, which hinder vision. I take it you don't have that issue of being a big guy ....Which brings us to big highway mpg. Thanks for all your googling of stats but I don't think they help this conversation, the point of which is to share experiences and go beyond the manufacturer and EPA dynometer specs. If you look on fuelconomy.gov or at Edmunds self reporting responses, BMWs get remarkable highway mileage - and mind you, these are BMW drivers who drive fast. The 328, 528 and even 535/335s are almost legendary for getting 29-33 mpg going 70 mph. I averaged 29 mpg going from SB to SF doing about 72 mph. Sure, these are self reporting and anecdotal but the number of them certainly helped convinced me and my experience confirmed them. Again, that is what these forums are for. Also, your mpg numbers use 2 pretty suspect models. The A4 FWD, which is [non-permissible content removed] due to the fuel saving CVT and the slow, remarkably cramped, Toyota-like IS250. BTW, my post starts off referencing your apparent mission (BMWs are for prestige hungry wannabees) but mainly, I just wanted some buyers to take a look at my personal experiences. Have a glass of wine or something (after you drive that nose heavy TL, that is....) "
"edwardsf","September 2010"," Yes, performance wise, the G and the 3 series seemed much better to me than the rest. I did not test the higher end 335, IS350, C350 or TLAWD as they seemed a bit pricey to me and the gas mileage on all, except the 335 was pretty bad. I don't need AWD. So we all have our own needs, which puts us into different markets. I had never thought about it before but the TL drivers do seem to be a bit combative. I think this thread has a huge TL vs. G battle in past years. I actually like both cars (I considered both in 2 car purchases) and think that many people would be happy with either. I think the G and 3 Series are a little more engaging to drive but every once in a while, I pine for a slightly smoother car - maybe like a TL or C300. I never pine for a GM, Suzuki or Toyota.... "

Please try reading the actual posts and responding to the actual text of the posts. It make the thread go better. For instance, if I say the 328 has better highway mpg than the other cars in its class, you are not responding to that statement by saying ""the 3-Series is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class."" That is what is called a strawman. Since you do it repeatedly, I doubt I can convince you to stop but I will try anyway. I did not refer to overall fuel economy as city mpg was not important to me in my purchase. I, like a lot of other people, drive very little city miles as I walk or ride my bike to work.

Please don't compare it to the 3 series. Also, I agree that no one cares about one's anecdotal experiences in beating the EPA numbers. However, people do seem to care about the dozens of reports from owners that could amount to some cumulative evidence about the real world operation of the vehicle that they are considering.

"shipo","September 2010"," The problem is that, in this era of airbags, anti-crush passenger zones, and gizmo packed cars, I seriously doubt any company could build your ""real sport sedan"" for an affordable price.FWIW #1, the 2011 328i weighs in at 3,362 pounds, only 165 pounds more than my 1999 328i. Not too shabby.FWIW #2, the last time a 3-Series sedan with an I6 engine weighed 3,000 or less was 1991 (although the 1992 tipped the scales at 3,021 lbs.).FWIW #3, given that the MUCH more capable 2011 328i weighs only 341 pounds more than the 1992 325i, I think BMW did a pretty good job at packaging all of the new safety requirements, structural integrity and extra size. Personally if I was given the option of the 1992 or the 2011, I'd choose the 2011 every time (although I would almost immediately chuck the RFTs in favor of a good set of GFTs, a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the car).

This is real easy but you seem to not understand nor would I provide links since your going to just dismiss them and thus waste my time. 1) German vehicles have lower resale values then their Japanese counterparts (look at ALG for that one) 2) On a whole, the German manufacturers still do not have the long-term reliability and less problems their Japanese counterparts have ON AVERAGE (look at CR long-term reliability history charts specifically). Can also say, the chance of getting a problem littered German vehicle is still slightly higher than the chance of getting a problem littered Japanese vehicle3) similar equipped BMW/MB and Japanese vehicles do not cost the same amount with the Germans having a few thousand price premium (just build them on each website with same equipment to find this out) Those 3 FACTS indicate that, SIMILARLY EQUIPPED Japanese vs German luxury vehicles are giving the Japanese a better financial decision to get. But, there are a lot of people not choosing the Japanese vehicle and opting for the more expensive, more depreciating, higher chance possibility of problem littered German vehicle. Some people making that decision HAVE to be doing based on the prestige/ reputation factor that MB and BMW have. Now, as you conveniently leave out every post you respond to and don't say, I've said time and time again, not ALL people are making that decision based on prestige, though you are trying to make it out that is what I'm saying; I've said before, some are making that decision for other reasons, like performance advantage, luxury comfort factors, etc but prestige is a factor.

I would have not tried that Mercedes a few years ago if it wasn't.

You cannot get an Acura or Infinity with an in-line 6 engine.

I know our CEO and CIO both purchased their Lexus LS's because it is ""supposed"" to be reliable...they didn't do exhaustive test drives or pour over long term reliability reports.I currently own a Lexus.

"smarty666","October 2010"," I would agree with you on points 1 and 2 for the most part but not on 3, 4, and 5.

Lexus definitely has the prestige factor or so many people would not flock to them month after month for most of their products have such souless driving. I feel the same way about MB but they do a little bit better job of not making the drive as boring as Lexus does but do not come close to Audi, Infiniti, or BMW when it comes to driving dynamics and sport performance. Infiniti gives passion for the driver, but if you have never had one you would not know that. I've raced many BMW's in my time with my Infiniti and have beaten many of them. Its a really fun to drive and I smile a lot when in it so there are Japanese vehicles that offer that passion and fun factor for the driver. In regards to point 3, Infiniti has really nice looking vehicles, tight bodies, and many sporty curves to them. BMW used to really lack in this area until the new 3 and 5 series which finally have some nice curves in their body styles and I quite like the looks of both of them now on the outside. Audi's body styles are really nice as well. In regards to point 4, the only German make who has a gorgeous interior is Audi. BMW is still on the plain side with little textures, color in their interiors and just are functional. Luckily they use high quality materials and little plastic which helps the blahness and makes the interior's livable and presentable. MB is using too much plastic like Acura does now on the interiors which is disappointing and a turn off for me. The new M from Infiniti has a really nice textured/high quality interior which competes finally on par with the Germans. Lexus has nice/high quality interiors as well depending on the model you get. There are plenty of Japanese vehicles that are for people who love to drive to any points in style, you just don't care to look for them. Talk about a rash generalization. "

"plekto","October 2010"," There are a few exceptions from time to time, though. The IS300, for instance, was awesome when it was released. The IS250/350 somehow lost that ""Euro"" feel and magic to it. I think it's more than just designing a car to handle well. I think it's that BMW and Mercedes know how to balance all of the factors so that none of them really stand out. ie - you get a solid B+ rating in everything and so it feels poised and has the same feel to it.A good analogy is a band. If one instrument stands out badly , it kind of ruins the thing. Japan usually gets only a couple of areas wrong, and sometimes manages this balancing act. GM -well, they're lucky if the band is in tune most days. :P "
"tlong","October 2010"," GM -well, they're lucky if the band is in tune most days. They sometimes play really well, it's just that the band has trouble getting through a song before one of the members goes unconscious from an overdose. :P "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Perhaps but they don't use enough high quality materials like BMW and Audi do consistently throughout the cabin. I've found way to many cheap imitation plastic things in their vehicles when I test drove them which bothered me a lot. I've seen two or three reviews over the last few years slapping them a little bit on the amount of plastic as well. Though the leather was really nice quality and comfortable I'll give MB that! "
"fedlawman","October 2010"," Plekto is right.The IS300 is a good example of a fine effort by Lexus to build a BMW. For the most part, they did a good job - in-line 6, 5 speed MT, fun to drive, and sporty inside. At the same time, they missed a few little things that held the car back from becoming a hit with enthusiasts - the interior was cheap and gimmicky (chronograph instruments), it wasn't as quick as a comparable BMW 330i, and it was nose heavy.Of course, the biggest problem with the IS300 was sales. It didn't appeal to Lexus shoppers. It wasn't quiet, luxurious, or elegant so it didn't sell well.A couple other opinions:GM makes the Cadillac CTS, which by all accounts is a fine car in this class. It compares well to any car in this category, and does well because it doesn't try to be all things to all people. It is what it is, and it's proud of that.Infinity is the closest Japan gets to building a BMW in this class, but it lacks many of the things that BMW buyers want - a smooth and refined driveline being at the top of the list. I also think it's wheelbase is too long and it's too heavy.Kind of off-topic, but the best recent examples of Japanese sports cars are the dearly departed Honda S2000 and the Mazda Miata and RX-8. These cars are/were fantastic because they aren't trying to beat BMW or be a ""Japanese BMW contender."" They are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great cars. Period. "
"jimbres","October 2010","  These cars are/were fantastic because they aren't trying to beat BMW or be a ""Japanese BMW contender."" They are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great cars. Period.Excellent point - very insightful post. I had never thought of the Miata & the RX-8 that way, but I see now that you're right.A used Miata can be a terrific value. A friend bought an 8-year-old Miata for less than $3K some years ago & is having an indecent amount of fun with it. It's not fast, but the handling is superb & the gearbox is almost as much fun as you-know-what. "
"nyccarguy","October 2010"," was also built to compete with the E36 BMWs or maybe the early E46 328i. The I6 was a smooth mill, but it wasn't that powerful (215 hp) and didn't get very good gas mileage for such a small car.It handled very well and was handsome once they tinted the taillights. The wheels were sharp & filled the wells quite nicely.It was ultimately too sharp, edgy, & rough for the traditional Lexus buyer. It didn't perform well enough to Wow the BMW crowd.There were actually a bunch of us BMW lovers back in late '05 that were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the '06 IS because we thought Lexus was so close with the 1st gen IS that it would hit a home run with IS version 2.0I happen to like the styling of the current IS. The IS 350 gets out if it's own way, but the brakes are instant on and cannot be modulated. Performance-wise, the IS250 doesn't compete at all with a 328i. For the price of an IS350, I'll spend a few $$$ more and get a very nice N55 powered 335i which is available with 6-speed manual transmission. "
"plekto","October 2010"," Like I said, they somehow missed that sweet spot. The G25, though, appears to be the magic combination, though. Especially with the Journey package and wood trim.

Because in Japan and Europe, you'll be able to get the manual version.Seriously, what part of ""put your best foot forward"" isn't reaching these guys? It's like GM's Regal. Get rid of the base model corporate nonsense. Get rid of the base trim, the puny base engine, and only offer your best example FIRST. Then offer a cheaper alternative in a year or so. You have to strike hard when the product is new and fresh. If all you hear(as GM did) is ""awesome, but the engine is pathetic"", by the time you get to doing it right, everyone will have passed on for better choices. "

Or as you would say, ""it is a FACT people buy the car they like to drive.""BTW, I would take a nose heavy TL over a MB anyday. MBs are very good looking but of course are very expensive, super costly to repair and are not nearly as fun to drive as Bimmers, Audis or Infinities.

"ivan_99","October 2010"," ""it is a FACT people buy the car they like to drive."" I'm not certain it is a fact.WE -- buy cars we like to drive (of course speaking for you here  ).A large number of people in my corporate office buy cars that have a good resale, have good reliability, look nice, have a good reputationThe way they drive (which I'm assuming means a well handling vehicle) is further down the list somewhere.Of course I suppose if the vehicle meets the requirements above (resale, reliability etc)...they'd ""Like to drive it""  "
"edwardsf","October 2010"," I loved the IS300 and they had a wagon. This was another Euroconcept that the IS300 had that Japanese cars normally eschew. And I love wagons and long hatches. The 1st gen G20 was also a tossable little sport sedan - something like the 1993-5 era Audi 4000. None of these three were rocket ships but then I don't buy cars for that. I will take tossabilty and usable torque over raw stoplight takeoff power. But that is just me. "
"edwardsf","October 2010"," Um,yeah. That was the point - my statement was an opinion and calling opinions ""facts"" is dumb. Reread my post.

Seriously, I would buy a minivan for that but not a sport sedan and that is what I was referring to. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," Thats not what I'm talking about. Up here in the Northeast, I would never buy just RWD vehicles b/c of the snow factor in the winter so its either FWD or AWD. So I'm left with the AWD option on a G if I were to get one. The fuel economy should be better than this with such a smaller engine in the vehicle and its size. I was hoping for 21/30mpg minimum but didn't even get that. To me, the way Infiniti has it, there is no big advantage of getting the G25 over the G37. Mise well get the bigger oomph G37. AWD G25 is rated 19/27mpg RWD G37 is rated 19/27mpg AWD G37 is rated 18/25mpg I'm left :confuse: "
"smarty666","October 2010"," We actually agree on somethings :surprise: :surprise:. I agree that many people buy the car they like to drive and one of the reasons some like to drive it, is b/c of the badge it has on the front end  . You be hard press to find BMW or MB drivers who would still think they would like to drive a vehicle with say a Chevy or Toyota emblem on them simply b/c they liked the way they drove. Reason why I would not consider MB the next go around is for personal reasons. Their vehicles are very luxurious/nice looking but both the C and E class have gotten way to close to the ground for my taste and I have a really bad back and would break my butt getting in and out of them all the time. Plus, as you pointed out, they are not as fun to drive as Audi's, Infinities, or Bimmers which is a factor for me when driving! Luckily, BMW and Audi have not followed MBs direction of low ground clearance on their sedans and those 3 makes will most likely be the brands I cross shop next time around, maybe Lexus if they can improve upon the IS enough for my liking.

"sweendogy","October 2010"," i agree the G25 is not a great deal in awd form vs the g37. MpG on this car stinks, i have a g35x. i really hope the g25 owners get more mpgs because the 3k difference in price FOR me is not worth the lack of quickness. I just went on infinitis website and the new g25 is now listed.. no manual stinks...no navi in the cheepo 25 and the price of the sport(g37) now starts with all the options (i would get them all, yes) and its a tad under 40k-- right now i am not a fan.. Infinti where is the manual AWD car we are looking for. "
"smarty666","October 2010"," It is my hope that the lack of manual, nav, and a few other things on the G25 was done intentionally by Infiniti b/c they really are just using the 25 right now to test the entry-lux level for it and see how it does. All those features it lacks would jack the price up on the G25 further making it compete in the G37 territory of price which would be just plain ridiculous. Remember, this generation G is coming to an end hopefully at the end of next year since 2011 is the fifth model year now, and it will be due for a redesign across the board for 2012.It's my hope that if the G25 sells okay for Infiniti that when they go to redo the 3G G-Sedan they will completely redo/rethink the G25 and add these features and maybe even make a totally different body style for it from the high trim G sedan. This is just speculation of course though. "

"
"nyccarguy","October 2010"," for different folks.Every single one of these cars has pluses and minuses to different people. For the longest time I've actually favored handling and driving dynamics over raw power and torque.Maybe I'm getting older & the fact that I live in CT where the entrance ramps on The Merrit Parkway are short and have STOP signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. My 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH handles brilliantly. However, its 200 horsepower @ 7000 RPM (7500 RPM redline), 156 lb/ft of torque @ 5250 RPM, & almost 128,000 miles just doesn't quite cut the mustard anymore. Even my wife's 4cyl TSX feels like it has more pickup. I'm not in the market now because I just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. Plus I think we're going to try and ditch the TSX next year to get wifey an SUV of some sort (she misses her '07 X3).So if she gets an SUV, then my next ride doesn't have to be huge. Just as long as it has LATCHes for the car seats so I can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasn't in years). In my new home,I'll be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.I believe with the modern electronic nannies (traction control, stability control, ABS), I can rock a RWD sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as I do with my Prelude).The G37S is priced right, has gobs of power, and I'm really impressed with how it handles. I've only driven an AWD G37X, so I can only imagine how well the S handles.BMWs are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. I love the way the E90 3 series drives, rides, handles, brakes. I've only owned new cars in my life since I passed my driving test at 16 (I'm only 34 now), but I will totally consider a CPO N55 powered 335i in the future.Like I said before, the Lexus IS350 appeals to me. I like the styling, the interior is very well finished I'm sure, They now offer an F Sport version of the IS which I'm sure sharpens the handling. I went to Lexus and built one, it isn't as expensive as I once thought. But no stick shift available on the IS350 kills me. I know there is a stick offered on the IS250, but that car has the pickup of a Corolla. At least the slushbox AWD version I drove did. The brakes are impossible to modulate. There is NO way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series. I keep my cars for a while. Going on 9 years with my '01 Prelude (bought new as a leftover in April '02). We'll see what happens when the time comes. "

"shipo","October 2010"," You beat me to it. Funny thing; I live in a rather hilly part of (often) snowy New Hampshire and I have yet to understand why so many folks ""need"" AWD. I mean geez, unless you have a driveway like my 'cross the street neighbor (a driveway that rises more than 100' over a distance of about 250'), I feel that the extra weight of an AWD system can actually lead to a less safe vehicle when it's slippery out there. ""Less safe?"" Some might question. Yes, less safe. Why? Because the extra weight will, if anything, lengthen stopping distances and reduce the already diminished capacity for a quick maneuver.FWIW #1, when we moved up here I had a 530i SP, and after the first quarter inch snow fall I promptly ordered a set of winter wheels and tires; they in turn transformed my 5er from a car that couldn't make it up my driveway (only a 9% grade), to a car that could easily reel in AWD and 4WD vehicles in rutted snow up to about 7"" deep (beyond that my car would turn into a snow plow, causing me to simply stay home or leave it at home in favor of a set of cross-country skis).FWIW #2, the neighbor I referred to above has a winter tire shod Audi A6 Quattro, and as often as not, when the snow flies I see his car either parked down by the street, or stuck kinda sideways some distance up above the road. Said another way, even AWD isn't all it's cracked up to be on really steep slopes. "
"Kirstie_H","October 2010"," It isn't *just* AWD on these vehicles. I'm certainly not an expert, but for whatever reason, I haven't had good luck with MPG results on Infinitis.

"smarty666","October 2010"," no, I didn't say they were ending the G they will be due for a redesign on the G model since 2011 is the 5th model year of the 2G. I wouldn't get so hung up on the lack of manual at this point. Like the article says, there is no demand for the manual and Infiniti even has trouble selling them in the G37 so most are not going to want the manual in a G25 and they might have some cost issues with at least offering. The TSX does not offer a manual and you don't see its sales tanking. Yes the option is nice to have but Infiniti might have the lack of it as an excuse to force people to get the more expensive G37 as a sales ploy so you never know. Maybe in the future they will make it an order only option.The 3G G models are just around the corner and I'm eagerly anticipating what Infiniti is going to do to their best selling vehicle. I'm interested to see what influence MB is going to have on the next gen G engine since Nissan/Infiniti is now in a co-op partnership with Diamler and they are suppose to be sharing things between divisions!

"smarty666","October 2010"," Well I can't speak for when, how, and what kind of vehicle you have, but I know from multiple bad winter storms here in NJ over the years, that with my FX, I was all over the road with just the RWD. I tried driving numerous times without the AWD and II was scared for my life. Even doing 10-20mph below speed limit and being extremely careful the wheels would spin out. Once I engaged AWD the vehicle felt planted to the road and I stopped spinning out and having difficulties controlling the vehicle. Everything I read to this day still says AWD is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and I concur with my own personal experience.To me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between AWD and RWD so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a little mpg. Personally, I like that Infiniti has AWD option and not AWD all the time like Subaru and others. This way, 85% of the year I can use just the RWD with better fuel economy and just use AWD when I need it specifically. If there is ice on the road forget AWD or any drive for that matter. When there is ice on the ground nothing can help you. "

"edwardsf","October 2010"," Hmm, what is this ""agree"" thingy? Well, okay, I will run with it. Regarding ground clearance, I have the same issue with getting in and out. My A4 avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series (sans sport package) and the Audi's seats were just a smidgen lower. This meant I used my back much more getting out of the Audi than I do now with the Bimmer. So make sure you try them all in various packages. BTW, the Bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the A4 sport. Of course, the Quattro sticks better due to AWD but the Bimmer's steering is just sublime. I truly think the Audi is the balance between the Bimmer and the Mercedes. I also felt that the Infiinty drove heavier than all three German cars. The G almost reminded me of an American muscle car. NB, I only drove used (2007-8) models. But since cars don't seem to get lighter, I think the Germans are probably more nimble feeling than the Infinity. Regarding my other infirmity, I have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise. The Germans win again, especially the C300 and the 3 series. The new A4 was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others. Also, the Lexus were pretty quiet. That said, I like almost all these cars on the list on the right. The only exceptions are the Caddy, which just seems gauche and the cramped, slow IS250. They all have their strengths and cars are really just better now. "

"jimbres","October 2010","  I can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. Just my personal preference. My guess is that you're a young guy. All-season radial tires didn't become widely available until the mid to late 1970s. Before that, just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires - from regular to snows, as they were called then - at the beginning of winter & then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring. Keep in mind that almost everyone drove RWD cars in those days. FWD didn't become widely available until the 70s, & AWD was available only on trucks until the 90s.I remember that Dad always made the switch to snow tires on the Friday after Thanksgiving.Something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if you're running with winter tires during the cold weather months. So the total ownership cost is less than you think.Given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road, do you really want to cheap out on them? Think about it. If you can't afford top quality rubber for your car, you might be better off riding the bus. "

In 8 & a half years, I've never been stuck in my Prelude once. That includes getting buried overnight while parked on the street in a snowstorm by the NYC Department of Sanitation, living in Westchester County (NYC suburb) that is anything but flat. Not once being able to NOT make it to work (not an option, my Dad is the boss & my name's on the door) due to inclement weather. People look at me like I have 4 heads and 5 feet when I tell them I switch to snow tires in the winter. "
"shipo","October 2010"," ""People look at me like I have 4 heads and 5 feet when I tell them I switch to snow tires in the winter.""Up here in New Hamster the only folks I give that look to are the ones that are still driving their winter tires in July. :P "
"smarty666","October 2010"," I don't know why you guys are making a big deal about this winter tire BS! Did you ever think maybe some people have special situations that would preclude them from doing so? Not only do I not want to spend the money on a second set a tires I only use a few months out of the year, I've had 3 back surgeries and major back problems and would break my a#$ trying to lug tires in and out of car to go have them put on the car twice a year and lug them down stairs for storage the rest of the year. I spent enough money on tires and back surgeries that I don't need to go and screw up my back just to get winter tires put on my car.Its much easier just to get AWD and it works fine for me and a lot of other people so live with it. Plus, I can't speak for other northern area of the country but I know that all the Infiniti dealers and BMW dealers around where I live only have AWD versions on their lots. The only way you can get RWD only is by special ordering one. Once in a while you might get lucky and see a RWD only on the lot but usually the service departments snatch them up as service loaners.

"shipo","October 2010"," ""The only way you can get RWD only is by special ordering one.""So? Since I prefer to do European Delivery (and save thousands of dollars in the process), I have to order anyway. Thinking about this further, since, ummm, 1979 we've ordered 8 of our 13 cars (including both of our RWD BMWs, one ED, one not). "
"mz6greyghost","October 2010"," Being from Upstate NY, I can mostly agree with the amount of AWD models on the local lots, but there are still RWD models available, without having to special-order them (and they're NOT only base models with no options either).As far as winter tires are concerned, granted each area has a different climate, but when you live in an area that averages over 150"" of snow per year, and when it can fall at rates of 4-6"" PER HOUR, winter tires are a must. I lose count of how many different AWD vehicles (SUVs, cars, etc.) that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their all-seasons can't keep up with the conditions. People tend to forget that AWD only helps with acceleration, but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads. Given a choice, I'd take a vehicle with winter tires over any AWD vehicle with all-season tires, no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain.And IIRC, there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tires/wheels for you when they're not needed, and will swap out the 3-season wheels/tires and store them in the winter months (for a fee, of course!)

"shipo","October 2010"," A point you might be missing is (for lack of a better phrase), not all snow, sleet and even ice is created equal. There are plenty of winter conditions where dedicated winter tires will find a fair amount of traction where even the best all-season tires will find virtually none. "

"sweendogy","October 2010"," i agree lawman.. but smarty is again mistaken as you posted, just like he was mistaken about me even talking about the TSX -- i have never made comments saying the tsx sales have tanked but I did say and prove (using hondas own sales numbers) that TL sales have ""tanked"" since they changed to the modern design -- i can pull up the numbers again for the TL --the car i mentioned. Smarty might be having flashbacks on the TL2009+ chat when i threw a bunch of slaes facts about the TL.

Yeah, your figures really showed how bad the TSX sales have tanked :blush: And here is the figures for the TL to show its decrease in sales and thus poor sales performance, taken from Acura media newsroom.YTD 2010 25,031YTD 2009 25,882YTD - 1.8% TL 2004 Sales: 77,895TL 2005 Sales: 78,218TL 2006 Sales: 72,348TL 2007 Sales: 58,545TL 2008 Sales: 48,766TL 2009 Sales: 33,620 As you can see, the sales decrease in the TL is quite substantial compared to the TSX and hence why I have said tanked for the TL. It is sad considering the TL was Acura's bread and butter model for so many years and that now has changed to the MDX.

There are many things I like about the 2011 TL but the new beak and added size are really negatives I don't think I can get past. I just drove a 2011 G37S (auto - wife ruled out the manual.... :blush: ) but it seems a bit small - I'll have to drive it again. I enjoyed the power and handling. Any thoughts out there? Any other cars to consider? I'm not a fan of the American offerings and while I love the drive of the 335i I don't like the price tag with all the options I'd want... :confuse: I've been on this board for several years now so I know someone might offer some thought I hadn't considered... "
"plekto","October 2010"," Does it have to be new? I have several that I'd recommend if you are willing to consider something a couple of years old, like a 2008 CTS. 20K, give or take, and just about perfect for your needs.I guarantee that it's not ""American"" in how it's designed or drives. Probably the only thing that GM has for sale now, in fact, that is like that. My second recommendation is actually also from GM, but you'd have to get a 2009 model, because GM stopped importing it to the U.S. then. Go test drive a Pontiac G8/Holden Commodore. It's a fantastic vehicle and is no problem to find one for less than 20K, certified. If you want something that handles well, is RWD, has a nice interior, and is a total sleeper/under everyone's radar, while being one size larger than a G37 - without the silly price tag, look no further.I personally like it more than the current CTS. I'm still incredibly shocked that GM took it's #1 selling passenger car in Australia(and best IMO, that they currently make worldwide) and stopped importing it to the U.S. Such an incredibly idiotic move. But you can get one used. Change the badges if you wish.  Note - it's also sold outside the U.S. as the new Chevy Lumina. So at least there's some hope of it returning next year or so.These two are the only options from GM that will satisfy you if you like how the TL and Infiniti and so on drive. Everything else, yes, it's a toad and should be avoided. But do check these out - you might be able to get a used/certified car and own it for only a little more than the payments on a lease of something like a 3 series. "

"ivan_99","October 2010"," I'm assuming your requirements are similar to your 08 TL i.e. you're ok with FWD...don't need super sport suspension tunning.You want space...more than an IS...something around a 5 series (if the price was right).You could almost list all manufacturers and they'd each have an offering in this segment.You mentioned that you're apprehensive about Audi reliability. Since you lease are you concerned about being stranded and/or inconvenienced with repairs? I'd take a look at the domestics as well (I actually liked the CTS...coupe looks very nice too)...go drive a CTS, LaCrosse, SHO...even go drive an MKS and see...of course if you 'know' you're not going to buy one then I suppose you're just waisting your time (I was surprised).If you're not keen on domestics how about the European? C350 is very nice, S60 looks nice (never drove)...might be small if a 5 series is your size requirement.At this point, for me, I'd lean more towards a new A4 2.0T...does everything well, looks real elegant and has good mileage.I liked the new TL as well (I also like the looks  ) ...it wasn't too large and the SH-AWD let me over-steer the back end out a bit...so that was pleasant. Plus you'd get your space requirements (guess Maxima has similar specs too).New Infiniti M37?You may also lean towards the vehicles with the 'included maintenance' as well... "
"igozoomzoom","October 2010"," It's painful for me to admit, but the beak on the current TL is the most hideous thing I've ever seen! This is coming from someone who still can remember my first time driving my cousin's brand new 1986 Acura Legend (dark blue with gray lower accent) and realizing that it was the most special car I'd ever driven. I later owned a 1994 Acura Legend GS that was the love of my life until it was demolished by a drunk jerk driving a huge 4x4- but it saved my life. I also owned a 2002 TL Type-S that was a spectacular car in every way...until the transmission went out at 32k miles and then again after another 20k miles...I didn't want to own it if/when the third transmission failed if it was out of warranty, so I had to get rid of it. Suffice it to say, I've been an Acura-phile from the very beginning in late 1985...but the newest designs range from bland to downright vulgar (TL)....the TSX seems to suffer the least from this design 'theme'?Have you considered the TSX V6 as a possible replacement for your '08 TL-S? It is less than an one-inch +/- in front and rear head, leg and hip room compared to your TL. Overall passenger volume is 94 cu ft vs. 98 cu ft for your TL, so it's only very slightly smaller. Interior cargo (luggage) volume is virtually identical at 12.6 vs. 12.5 cu ft. The Infiniti G37S is almost identical in every interior measurement (head/leg/hip room) to your TL, with 99 cu ft of passenger volume and 13.5 cu ft cargo volume. So it's not smaller in any way than the TL, but the interior design or other design aspects may may it 'seem' to be...I'd give it another look before ruling it out! If you are leasing, would the larger Infiniti M37 also be within the realm of possibilities? It has a boost in headroom and legroom in front and rear compared to the TL. Total passener volume is 104 cubic feet and cargo volume is 14.9 cu ft. Not sure if I like it any better than the G37S, but it might be something to consider....And one other wild card that I will recommend, if a luxury 'brand' isn't esssential and you're just wanting a car that looks and performs in the same realm with most entry-level performance/luxury models- the 2011 Mazda6 s Grand Touring 4-door. The current 2010 is a very impressive vehicle, with exceptional handling and plenty of power any time you need it! The 3.7L V6 only has a 272hp rating, but it has 269lb-ft of torque (matching the torque figures for the 330hp M37 and exceeding all the other cars discussed above, despite their 280-328hp ratings). It also hits that torque peak at 4250rpm, compared to 5200rpm in both Infinitis.The only two options on the 2010 MZ6 s Grand Touring are Voice-Activated Navigation and the Technology Package. The Tech Package adds Advanced Keyeless Entry & Start with push-button starting, SIRIUS sat radio, LED tail lights, Fully automatic Bi-Xenon HID headlamps, power passenger seat and rain-sensing wipers. With those two options, it is a very close match for the G37S, feature-for-feature but for $6-7k less! The 2011 model is getting a 'refresh' that willl only make the car more attractive and upscale in look and feel. It's worth a visit to the Mazda dealer one day, just to experience the car for yourself. My best friend and I took one for a test drive two weekends ago and he wasn't even in the market for a new car....but he traded his 2008 IS 250 on the spot for it! =) "
"smarty666","October 2010"," I can definitely feel you about the new TL. I have a 08 as well and the new one is such a turn off on the exterior for me its not even funny. If you think the G37 is small then I would not recommend a 3 Series or C-Class since they are even smaller on the inside. I would recommend a Caddy CTS or like other's have mentioned the new Maxima. If your looking for the true sport sedan feel you won't get that completely with the Max due to the CVT/FWD but it definitely has got a more sport oriented handling and power. I ended up with one b/c like you did not want a G37 due to the cramped feeling when in it. The Max has plenty of room, pretty sporty body style, and you get certain features you normally can only get in luxury sedans if you get the premium packages. The leasing and financing for it are excellent and many people are getting fully loaded ones for $34-35k. If that doesn't fit your bill, I would check out the Genesis but again, some people don't like the Hyundai name plate. Not sure what budget or finances are for your but if possible, I would check out the new M and 5 Series as well. They are definitely going to fit your bill when it comes to size and features but you will pay more for them obviously. Best of Luck!!! "
"dap2006","October 2010"," Great post! Gave me some things to think about. I haven't been an Acura fan as long as you but I had a 92 Accord that I loved and kept 12 years - I got a 2006 TL after that and then my current TL-S. I had driven the 335i before I got the TL-S and loved the drive - almost pulled the trigger but my wife had loved the Honda/Acura's (2 previous Civic's) so I caved and I went with my current ride (which is nice, don't get me wrong).I'm not a Mazda fan but I'll take a look at the MZ6 to see what it looks like. I can't see me driving a Benz, though - too much coin for what you get. So far I'm thinking the Audi A4/S4, G37S and M37 seem the likely suspects... :shades: :shades: "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," I loved the Mazda6 V6 as well...in the manual-auto mode I had it in 1st gear at around 4k rpm -- just going down the street. I hammered it and chirped the tires into 2nd gear.Not really a marketable feature...or even worthy of purchasing it for (since it is very good overall). But a very powerful V6. Rear seat room is HUGE too.LOVED the manual in the Mazda 6...too bad it only was on the 4cylNot much love for the Mazda 6...don't see many.Same as the VW CC -- don't see many. I actually prefer the CC over many in this thread. "
"plekto","October 2010"," I will mention, though, that the new CTS is worlds better than anything Mazda makes. It's positioned in Europe as a BMW 5 series competitor at a lot less money. My parents just went through this exact same scenario. And had it down to the same models are you are looking at. And the CTS just simply was a superior product to the Infiniti. The only vehicle that gave it serious competition was the C300, which is my #1 pick if money is no object. It;s everything that you want and Mercedes is apparently finally making their cars right again. Though currently only the C class is benefiting, as will the upcoming model E class(it takes time to re-tool and phase in new technology)Also, I mentioned the G8 because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and engine as a CTS. It's a worlds better choice than the LaCrosse and actually is fairly attractive by comparison(looks like a cross between the CTS and the LaCrosse, IMO - slightly rounded but not a jellybean.But let's look at the math on slightly used vs lease:First off, Infiniti has no financing options currently on 2011 models. (it's impossible to find a 2010 to lease at this point). Fail.Let's look at Acura, then. Oops. Same deal.K... Mercedes. Mercedes always runs leases(as does VW and Audi) C300 $349/month for 27 months. 10K/yr. $3141at signing.Total at lease end: 12215 in payments. $452.41/month.(a BMW 328i is $439/month with 0 down at signing for reference)Let's have some fun, then. 2011 Accord EX. $229 /month for 36 months. $1499 at signing. Total at lease end: 9743 in payments. $270.64/month.Now why would I do this comparison? Because to lease any vehicle, you have to factor in what it costs versus a used model that still has the same amount of factory warranty left. 36 months lease vs 36 months(or more) warranty. Now, the main deal here is the drive train, which is pretty much all that matters(most certified cars get an extension anyways and the gremlins have been worked out/fixed. It's basically a wash, IMO, since a 2 year old car won't break anyways unless it's something nasty like a Suzuki or Daewoo. I did a 2 minute search for a 2009 G8 with low mileage and under $25K.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=279792030Figure $22K now and $12K in three years. That's $10K for three years. I put the Accord in as a comparison because what this means is that you can get a certified year old vehicle and run it for three years for the same price as an economy car lease.But there's no wear and tear adjustment, no money factor idiocy or other tricks, no mileage cap or penalty. In short, you can OWN and decide to keep to trade whenever you want for the same price as a lease. The only difference is the payment structure per month. But a 72 month payment plan will usually net (now due to silly low interest rates) about the same monthly payment as a lease. If you want out of it, or to buy it at the end of the ""payments"", it's a clear win. Keep paying the bank or just sell it and end up with 0 month owed after 36 months.I get about $350 a month in this scenario vs $450 a month for the Mercedes or BMW. Note - you can get a 2008 CTS for about ~25K and the money works out the same as the CTS depreciates a bit less - ~15K at 6 years old. The only difference is $400 a month and the same $10K total cost.Let some other person eat the 10-15K initial depreciation. Never buy new. "
"alltorque","October 2010"," I will mention, though, that the new CTS is worlds better than anything Mazda makes. It's positioned in Europe as a BMW 5 series competitor at a lot less money. Here in UK, the BMW 5's run from ?31k for the 523i SE to around ?50k for the 550i SE, with lots of diesels. The Cadillac CTS runs from ?27k for the 2.8 V6 thro' ?30k for the 3.6 V6 to ?56k for the 6.2 V8, (though who would buy that beats me). CTS is generally compared unfavourably to BMW/Merc/Jag/Audi due to poor ride/handling, (our roads aren't great), and having no diesel options..............a very big points loser !Not sure I've ever seen one on the road.The Mazda 6 runs from ?16k for the 1.8 S through to ?23k for the 2.2D Sport Estate, (wagon). Gets rated highly, for price, if a tad noisy and there are lots of diesels. "
"dap2006","October 2010"," I drove the Audi A4 Premium Plus w/ sport package today - I was looking for a Quattro but they had just arrived and weren't prepped yet. Great interior, solid, high quality all around - liked the nav, seats, LED's etc.. much to like here. Only problem - turbo lag. The salesman assured me the car would learn how I drive and adjust within 500 miles, also that the Quattro had half the lag - I'll go back and see. Other than that, very pleasing...Anyone else have any experience with the A4 turbo? Does the lag improve? "
"tlong","October 2010","  Personally I don't see how 4wd or ""learning how you drive"" would get rid of turbo lag. Might be a BS salesman wanting a sale or lease. But what do I know? "

"edwardsf","November 2010"," Re: the acceleration, I think it is called salesman ignorance, not BSRegarding the turbolag in the A4, I think it is not the AWD but is the lousy CVT Audi puts in the FWD A4. The CVT improves gas mileage but acceleration suffers. (I liked the CVT in the Maxima.) I test drove several 2010 A4s with and without the CVT and there is a huge difference between the CVT and the tiptronic in the Quattro - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster. I had a 2007 Quattro A4, which had a little more turbo lag - the 2010 is much smoother and almost eliminates turbo lag. That said, turbo lag ain't all bad because it means you get turbo acceleration. As fun and fast as my 328iT is, it does not give the whoosh that the torque in the A4 gives in 40-60 mph. I am an odd creature in that I love Audis (and Swedish Saabs) but don't own one. I own a bimmer because it is quieter and I have a hearing problem. Both are vunderval! cars. The A4 is prettier, with more luxurious leather and a smoother, more refined driving feel. The 328 handles better, is faster throughout the mph range and is more reliable. The 335, of course, is faster but much more expensive and has a lousy repair record. Regarding size, the 328i (sedan) is a bit cramped but the iT (sportwagon) has about the same amount of interior space as the A4 sedan and wagon. Or, how about a used 528 or 535? If you get a 2009, you get 4 years of warranty - 2 years of original warranty and two years of CPO. You eliminate those first two years of huge depreciation if you bargain well. Cars.com has a 2009 in L.A. with 13k for $36,000. You could get it for $31,000. Other thoughts - try the new Volvo S60. It looks very cool and is very fast. New Jags are gorgeous. Dap, You are right: The G37 IS cramped. The C300 IS cramped. The IS250 IS like a 70s band - supercramped. The TL DOES have a nasty beak and is sorta ponderous. The TSX IS downscale from these cars but still a cool rig. The CTS - despite what Pletko thinks - IS an American car. "
"plekto","November 2010"," Yes, but it's unlike anything GM has produced to date. It punks almost everything from Japan and most of the stuff out of Europe and was designed with European tastes and drivers in mind.But yeah, it is made by a U.S. based company. "

"plekto","November 2010"," Kind of odd, though, that you won't consider a pre-owned CTS while you will consider a pre-owned 535. They are fairly similar. But the CTS is a lot less expensive as a CPO vehicle and quite a bit more reliable as well.Another car to try out - and this is a bit of an oddball, but bear with me - is the RX8. It fits 4 adults just fine, and the oddly shaped rear doors aside, it's basically a 4 door sport sedan. Fantastic ride, though - just a tiny bit slower than a Boxster and handles as well, too. The last would be either a Saab or Volvo. Other than that, well, you're stuck with crossovers and SUVs. It honestly sounds like your wife wants a RAV4 or similar and you want a 3 series and you're stuck in a no-man's land of trying to find the perfect compromise. Except that compromises by nature aren't perfect and never will be. P.S. If you want Audi at less money, just get the VW version. But expect to pay a lot in repairs and upkeep for both.

That's about all that's left. As for the VW/Audi comparison, it depends which models. He obviously thinks that the A4 is too small, so the next size larger, well there IS a VW that uses the A3 platform but is between the A4 and A6 in size (ie - the Passat) While they aren't literal clones, they share so much DNA and parts they might as well be fighting over who gets the china in the estate sale. I'd certainly not pay Audi prices without looking at the Passat first. "

"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," I'll throw in my $0.02 here, realizing that that's all it is...You're likely to get much more bang for your buck by going used on any of the 3 vehicles at the top of your list. I'd look for off-lease / CPO vehicles. In my experience, leased vehicles are often more well-looked after if for no other reason than the person leasing fears extra charges at lease turn-in. I bought a G35 several years ago off-lease and it had taken a pretty significant depreciation hit.... I've beat the tar out of it mileage-wise and mechanically it's still perfect. YMMV. "
"dap2006","November 2010"," I'm going to look into the CPO options, though I like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive. "
"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," You seem to have a pretty good idea of your wants & needs, and that's great. I'm sure you'll end up with what's right for you. The only aspect of leasing vs. buying CPO for *me* is that I can get a used G-series with a shorter (than 5 year) term loan and the payment on that is about the same as a lease payment (assuming there are up-front costs associated with the lease), and after 3 yrs or so, I own the vehicle and can use the trade-in value on a new vehicle. Something to thing about and research, but in the end you should just do what you can afford and what makes you happiest! "
"plekto","November 2010"," I could have sworn that I also pointed that out before as well. :P Why lease when you can own it for the same money a year or two older? Everyone that I know who has done this instead has had a lot less stress and worries as well, because there's no issues with mileage, wear, or other idiocy that they make you go through with a typical lease. And the interest rates are often quite a bit better on a car loan versus a lease when you crunch the numbers.The cars you are looking at are fine, really - I happen to like the CTS. But that's literally the ONLY GM or Ford car that I can stand - I'm certainly no fan and would buy a Mercedes or similar in a heartbeat over anything else they make. I've owned a (used) S Class in the past and the Domestics have a LONG way to reach that level. For the first three months I'd constantly be amazed just getitng into it and playing with the options. - there was a literal chasm between my previous Buick and the Mercedes. It died - sad story there. Then I got a 4x4 Two other cars to look at would be the E class and the Lexus GS350. These depreciate quickly and are two excellent ""hidden gems"" in the CPO world. A 2007 GS 350 should run you about 25K and a 2009 E class (built on the new more reliable C class platform, but stretched) should be about 30K.Optimally, 4 years old is the sweet spot between age and pricing, but the E class came out in 2009. The 2008 and earlier models were a disaster to keep running by comparison.IIRC, Mercedes also has new car financing (1.9%) and leases on CPO models from time to time.(yes, lease a CPO used car - C class payments on a E class) Lexus might have changed to this as well in reaction - You'd have to check for specifics.edit - they DO have 1.9% for 48 months on CPO C class models right now - it's going to be hard to beat that price-wise. The new/better body style started in 2008. IMO, the rear seats in the new C class are roomier than in the G37. The panoramic sunroof is incredible as well. "
"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," well, you do get the full warranty in force for (usually) the duration of ownership if you lease. I can understand why that would be attractive. And, if you consider trading in to be a hassle that is just not worth the effort, there's another reason.I wouldn't lease, but I can understand why some people do. "
"igozoomzoom","November 2010"," ""I'm going to look into the CPO options, though I like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive.""BMW Financial Services and Infiniti Financial Services both offer leases on CPO vehicles, just like new ones. BMW limits the lease term to no more than 48 months on vehicles that aren't current model year, but that's the only major difference that I am aware of. The lease payments should also be quite a bit lower than new without the hit of first year depreciation!BMW CPO warranty extends the New Car Full Vehicle 4-year/50k warranty to 6-years/100k miles. Infiniti also extends the warranty to 6yrs/100k. If you decide to check out Infiniti CPO offerings, I still find the previous-generation (2006-2010) M35/M45 very appealing....especially the M35 Sport model! =) "
"edwardsf","November 2010"," I just finished a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a CPO. Kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be costly. Also, I never felt it was my car ('because it wasn't,' someone will say ; - ). But leasing a CPO is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of change BTW, I think the BMW CPO is not quite as good as you have it described. When the new car warranty ends the CPO begins. It is consecutive, not cumulative. So, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a CPO car, the new car warranty ended at 50k. So you only get 2 years or 40k miles of CPO - whatever is less.  I think you pay $50 when you take it in for CPO repairs. Also, the CPO also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car. Still, for $22,000 off the MRSP of a car with no model changes, I will take it. "
"r34","November 2010"," There is no deductible for the CPO program of Saab (the dealers were more generous to define an issue as warranty work too) but there is a $50 deductible (per service visit) for Audi, BMW, and Infiniti.Several of my friends got G35 and FX34/45 with no extended warranty or CPO, they seem to be doing fine.CPO is a way to go for European cars. The repair could be expensive. I had 3 Saabs. They had good engines but got minor issues. The 9-5 Aero was the best and I still missed it. I wanted to try something different.I tried the G35x but was not impressed. I was looking at Infiniti EX/FX and BMW 530xi but ended up with a 335xi (love the twin turbo and I didn't need backseats). I traded one Saab for a V6 A4 and another Saab for a 335xi (I need AWD for my daily commute to Milwaukee from Chicago).Except the 1st Saab, I bought them all as used (CPO). No big issues with them. The A4 seems to be better. VW is still unreliable but Audi seems to be ok now (mine has zero problem). I test drove the Passat. Audi and VW are different! I like the interior and the image of of Audi (good for road trip) but I like the power and handling of the Bimmer. If the new S4 is really as good as the 335i, I will definitely get the S4.If backseats is a MUST, I would pick 535i. "

"
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," CPO cars are a great way to ""save"" money in this ultra competitive Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedan segment. You still have to do some digging & not just take the dealer's word for it as all CPOs are not created equal. Some dealers look at the car with a more finely tuned microscope than others. Check into the service records. Is it a local car serviced by the selling dealership or was it bought at a company auction? One poster on the X3 board (from AZ I think) test drove a CPO X3 that he felt wasn' up to snuff. Something about the back window regualtors being faulty, he ended up buying the X3 in CA I think. You still are buying a used car.From a ""deal"" standpoint, leasing a CPO car doesn't make sense. For the simple reason that no 2 CPO cars are alike. The dealer can set their own lease rates & money factors. It isn't like leasing new where there is a November program and the lease rate on every 2011 335i w/ X drive sedan is 0.XXXX or residual is XX%. There are just way too many variables that the dealer controls that you as a consumer don't have access to. Even the asking prices are arbitrary. You could negotiate a fantastic deal of $5K off, and then they jack up the lease rate and say the bank set a low residual.Free Scheduled maintenance is a crucial sticking point that makes BMW stand out. Yes were are all smart enough that it is built into the car and it isn't technically free. But however they do it, it makes sense. Now many of us use indie mechanics once the warranty period is up, but to prove BMWs practice is valid, you have to assume that people are taking their cars to the dealer for service.BMWs 1st service comes at around 15K miles. Gets you an oil change.Now my wife has a 2010 Acura TSX. I had the oil & filter changed at 4500 miles (Synthetic), even though the service advisor begged me to wait until the light goes one (10,000 miles). I think it was a little over $100 with a tire rotation.Service #2 which is technically the 1st service is what I did at 4500 miles $100+.I did at 10,000 miles.Service #3 I did at 20,000 miles and I specifically instructed them to only do synthetic oil,filter, & tire roatation.Many of Acura's ""services"" they offer are nothing more than visual checks of belts, hoses,lights... along with the oil change & tire rotation probably cost a few hundred dollars.BMW's 2nd service is an Inspection I service which is a major service at around 30K miles.Sometime after the 2nd service you are going to need brakes and rotors on your 3 series. At least the fronts. My parents had to have this done on my Mom's '08 328xi also right after the odometer said 50K and it was $700. They also recently had an Inspection II done (out of warranty) and the car needed rear brakes - $900.No it it almost isn't fair to compare the TSX to the rest of these because it is by far the least expensive car in the segment.But take your run of the mill car that's sitting on the luxury dealer's lot which in CT/NY/NJ means AWD, Automatic, Premium Pkg, Cold Weather Pkg, NAV and the sticker prices(328i w/ X Drive, C300 SPort 4 Matic, IS250 AWD, CTS4, A4 2.0T Premium, G37X) can't be that far off, so you definitely have to factor in free maintenance into the equasion. The MSRPs on ALL these cars are north of $40,000. "
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," CPO cars are definitely worth mentioning in this discussion. There are a lot of these Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans that are leased for whatever the reason. There is a school of thought out there that these cars (especially European makes, totally unfounded BTW) ""turn into pumpkins"" once the twarranty runs out. The fact is that all of these cars are exceptionally well built and are priced accordingly between $40<000 & $50,000. My experience with the '01 Prelude (130K miles) leads me to believe that these (and most modern) cars will run well past 50K miles with no major problems as long as you maintain them.I've only bought new since my 16th birthday, but I'd strongly consider a used 3 or G as my next ride. Payments on a high $20K car are a lot easier to swallow than on a $40- $50K car. "

"
"smarty666","November 2010"," I tend to agree with you about CPO, especially with the Germans, since they don't retain their resale value as well as the Japanese, by getting CPO with them, your not taking the brunt of the depreciation like the original owner has. Only disadvantage to CPO is that most, not all, but most of the CPO's I see on the luxury lots you have no idea how the previous owner took care of it (what kind of oil did they use, tires rotated properly, cleaned interior regularly, etc). I've found most do nothing to keep up the leather and vinyl interiors and they look like utter crap at only the 2 or 3 year mark when they are back on the lot as CPO and then you have a pain in the butt time trying to undo the neglect the first owner did. The stealers did little as possible to really clean up the car for used sales again, especially on the interior. But from a value proportion, money, and just to be in a luxury name, I can definitely see the attraction to CPO! "
"sweendogy","November 2010"," smarty i would of guessed the germans (certainly bmw) would keep values-- i mean they lease more bmws then other cars in the group (my guess is the TL is prob second on the lease vs buy list) and the main reason is resale value-- prob part of the reason why bmw offered free oilchanges and other things to get people to lease a car that costs over 45k..plus bmw could sell a 3 year old 3 series for over 30k. I would dissagree with you on your CPO diss- the CPO report includes past maintenance -(btw is this the same lot you talked about hyundai, in the TL chat?) and if a car is certified i would wonder why bmw/audi/ infiniti would sell a car that was not properly cared for..certainly with whats going on with toyota and if there is data to say the car was not up to certification-- you think they want bad press for including a car that has not infact passed the 150 pt inspection. Your talking about a 3 year old car that has less then 40k miles on it-- how bad is the leather?? does it have rips?? how they cared for it--come on -- if it has a rip the dealer fixes it. I have no idea where you are looking at CPO's (the same hyundai dealer ?)-- but you should look to see what reports on each car are avail before making such comments on ""MOST"" CPOS..Value yes -- lux name yes-- attraction yes.-- :shades: "
"roadburner","November 2010"," Only disadvantage to CPO is that most, not all, but most of the CPO's I see on the luxury lots you have no idea how the previous owner took care of it (what kind of oil did they use, tires rotated properly, cleaned interior regularly, etc). I've found most do nothing to keep up the leather and vinyl interiors and they look like utter crap at only the 2 or 3 year mark when they are back on the lot as CPO and then you have a pain in the butt time trying to undo the neglect the first owner did. The stealers did little as possible to really clean up the car for used sales again, especially on the interior. I couldn't agree more, my 2004 X3 CPO(purchased in 12/05) looks like crap- especially after six years and 103,000 miles: "
"smarty666","November 2010"," you need to do more readings on resale values, the Japanese have always had a edge over that then the Germans; there is nothing wrong with that, heck the Germans retain value better than the American brand still so its all good whether you go Japanese or German in regards to resale value and depreciation. Check out ALG website for the residual value awards and you'll see Acura tops the list for the last 2 or 3 years I believe, several other sites list Acura as top for resale value followed closely by Lexus and Infiniti. I hate to break it to you but CPO does not include past maintenance; I've returned plenty of lease vehicles from different manufacturers over the years who did not even care to see my maintenance records so there is no possible way for them to know, when they act like that at lease return, how the car was maintained and I'm sorry, but I've seen plenty of 2, 3, and 4 year old CPO cars out on the stealers lots for sale with really bad interior care from the previous owners; some of the stealers do the bare minimum when they put the cars back out on the used car lot for sale, you want to know why ""ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MAKING MONEY, THEY ARE A BUSINESS"" I'm talking about some scratches, rips, severe wrinkles, discoloring, etc on the leather/vinyl; this is noticeable, at least to a car guy like me who takes excessive care of his vehicles, maybe not to the common folk but to me; some of the interiors look like the leather is 7, 8, or 9 years old when its really only 3 or 4. You can tell when looking at a vinyl or leather interior whether its been kept up or not. Your naive if you think that all the stealers really do all that they say they do in their marketing ploys for CPO. They just make sure things work in the car and that nothing is broken, and they give the car a wash and wax before putting it out on the lot. And if you read what I said carefully, which you rarely do, I said the CPO's I HAVE SEEN, most had interiors that were very worn and not kept up! "
"smarty666","November 2010"," She's in nice shape! I can tell just by the pictures that you take care of her on a regular basis. The conditions I am talking about are nothing like that! Was that the condition you got her in or is that after years of your tender love and care?  "
"roadburner","November 2010"," Was that the condition you got her in or is that after years of your tender love and care?

If your buying a 2-3 year old car you should expect a couple of scratches and minor wear-- its a used car..hello.I know they are in it to make money--But they come with a warranttee and the check list of things done with the car to make it a CPO-- including tires, breaks, whatever and if something is needed it should be fixed--and if the consumer is smart they can have the car checked out before its bought.Your right i sometimes zoneout when reading your longposts i'm sorry could be my OCD..but you have to admit your statements about all the cars you have seen i mean its pretty funny how you always have a story to discount the previous poster... all those cars with bad leather.. oh man "
"smarty666","November 2010"," it doesn't include maintenance if you haven't had it done at the dealership and they DON'T TAKE THE FREAKING PAPERWORK that you have as proof when you return your vehicle back in! I have had it happen with Infiniti, MB, and Caddy. Acura was the only one who took my maintenance records when I returned the vehicle! Here is your proof for ALG residual value since you have to be such a pestering noob about it! It will be interesting to see how you twist and turn this link and its information to suit your own purpose.https://www.alg.com/ResidualValueAwardsInfiniti actually took the top spot from Acura who has had it for the last two years. Good for Infiniti. Seriously, what is wrong with you that you don't get what I'm saying. I have leased many luxury vehicles and some of the makes don't even collect maintenance records. I didn't have the stuff done at the dealership. Even if a computer records it, there is no way for the computer to know what grade, type, content of fluids and/or gas someone is putting in.I do have to say, that not all CPO's are equal. I know Acura and BMW have some stringent CPO standards compared to the rest. When I turned my Acura in, they wanted all my maintenance records which I happily gave them. Others, were much more lazy and didn't really care about the maintenance of the vehicle as long as it passed the return inspection and nothing was severely damaged (Infiniti, MB, and Caddy were the biggest culprits of this). Talk about the kettle calling the pot black, you complain about the fact that I supposedly say ALL vehicles, when in actuality I say either MOST or SOME, which is not all and then you can't leave Acura owners alone b/c of your sour experience with them and that ALL their products aren't great and you can't figure out why people are choosing them over others. And again, I said MOST of the one's I SEE! Does that mean all vehicles, no, so stop putting words in my mouth and twisting around what I say! I'm talking about the CPO vehicles I've seen on all the luxury manufacturers lot that have really worn, faded, sometimes severely wrinkled interiors. There are some that are not like that. I never implied that all CPO's are like that or said that. But there are some that dealers think are acceptable, when they really aren't and still put them out on the lot without doing a lot of cleaning and reconditioning to them. I state facts man, unlike you, who sole goal on edmunds is to argue with people. :sick: "

"
"nyccarguy","November 2010"," sanjaysdca - 20K on an '08 MDX? You gotta get out and drive more my man. We purchased my wife's 2010 TSX Tech at the end of August 2009 & she has over 24,000 miles on it already. The leather, specifically the left side bolster on the driver's seat definitely shows some signs of premature wear. Probably my one knock against the car (other than the fact that it isn't rear wheel drive & I'm not a fan of the electric power steering).I just built a handful of these ELLPS during my lunch break. I configured each vehicle to the level of equipment on the TL SH AWD. Even at this price point, value has to come into play somehow. All cars have manual transmissions as I'd get.Acura TL SH AWD - $43,445Infiniti G37S - $40,325Audi A4 2.0T Prestige (Metallic Paint, S Line Sport Package) $45,250BMW 328i $45,150(Premium, Sport, Cold Weather, iPod, Sirius, Xenon, HK, Nav, Met Paint)BMW 335i $52,200(Cold Weather, Premium, Sport, Nav, HK, iPod, Sirius, Met Paint)The TL is deinitely the biggest car. So if you want performance, plus room for 4 full sized adults, and a generous sized trunk, the TL is your car. I actually dig the styling of the TL in it's SH AWD guise. It definitely has a presence about it on the road. I love the lip spoiler on the back & the faux quad exaust. The wheels look sharp. It gets fantastic reviews & write ups. Your best bang for the buck in this segment is definitely the Infiniti. That's a whole lot of horsepower for your just over $40K sticker. They give BIG discounts on these too.I think the A4 is a nice looking car, but am not sure if a 4 cyl cuts the mustard with it's $45K price tag. I know it is probably the best turbo 4 on the market, but it is still a 4. Good amount of passenger room, nice sized trunk.Dynmanically, the BMWs are the best. Nothing comes close to the way a 3 series drives. $52K is a lot of money for a car the size of a Honda Civic. $45K is a lot to ask of a 230 hp car. I know it isn't about straightline acceleration & 0-60 mph times. "
"sanjaysdca","November 2010"," sanjaysdca - 20K on an '08 MDX?I guess I have to agree with you here...but my office is 10 miles one way and my wife telecommutes...and everything we need/want is within 10 mile radius...so most of the miles are recreational.Back to cars...I have driven loaners TSX and TL and I prefer TSX over TL.Your price points are interesting. Didn't think TL is that expensive. As far as BMW and Dynamics go, I think BMW were good dynamically but the new ones are more luxury-less performance. I testdrove brand new 2011 BMW 5 series and 2010 5 series and found older model to be more satisfying to drive. "

You get a hefty chunk taken off the MSRP. Styling is a very subjective matter. I like the TL SH AWD's styling. I'm also a big fan of the former E60 BMW 5 series styling as compared to the current F10. I also prefer the E60 to the former E39 (ducking and running). "

"nyccarguy","December 2010"," Much as it did that winter night/morning in Buffalo during the late fall of 1996. I was at a cliub with some friends in Buffalo (I went to college about 2 1/2 hours away in Ithaca). My friend who I was visiting (and at the club with) was in a shall we say intoxicated state and getting very friendly with a 6' tall blonde. At about 3:30 AM I decided I had had enough and wanted to go back to his place to crash. ""Chris, give me your keys. I'll meet you back at your place later. Call me if you need a lift.""With the flick of his wrist, he tossed me the keys to his 1995 E36 BMW 325is. Red/Black leather. 5 speed manual transmission. HK, Sunroof, & most importantly Sport Package + additional factory lowering.Now up until this point, I was a novice at driving stick and had never had any real seat time in a BMW. I thought they were for ""show offs."" My entire point of view changed by the time I took off from the 1st traffic light. I had never driven a car that I just felt so perfect in. I drove the car around the streets of Buffalo for the next 2 1/2 hours. By the end of the night, I was steering around right turns with the throttle & rotating around corners perfectly. I've wanted a BMW ever since.Fast forward to December 2, 2010. The numbers don't mean a whole helluva lot. BMW gets good money for their cars and they are worth every penny. I've got my Mom's '08 E90 BMW 328xiA (almost 61,000 miles) until Saturday. Even saddled with all wheel drive & automatic transmission, it is still a true driver's car. You all know how much I love my '01 Prelude Type SH (almost 132,000 miles). My Mom's BMW is one of the few cars I've driven that almost make my Prelude feel ""loose."" The drive from my parents house in Rockland County, NY to my house in Stamford, CT changed my mind and reinvigorated my passion for BMWs. I'd take a 328i with its 230 horsepower, no NAV, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick. It is just an amazing car to drive.

Up until that point, all I had owned/driven was my dad's Accord, and my Alfa Romeo Spider and CRX Si.I had a similar epiphany - how could such a simple car (my uncle is minimalist - his E30 had NO options) be so much better than anything I had ever driven. Of course, I didn't have the scratch to buy a BMW so I owned many more imitators before I finally got the real thing.They really are that good. Sublime. "

"saratoga3","January 2011"," group,just wondering if anyone out there has looked at the Nissan Maxima? I have expanded my serach from Lexus and Infiniti and would appreciate any comments. "
"plekto","January 2011"," It's a fine car, though to me it seems a bit ""last generation"". IMO, there's zero reason to buy it instead of the G37. IMO, it's a bit like the Buick Lucerne or Grand Marquis in that it's a vehicle that's left over/still being produced and stuck in an odd place, because it's not really filling any specific role/market segment at this point. They've always made the Maxima and probably always will. For me, though, the CVT in the Maxima just kills it completely. And it's needlessly pricey to fix. You'd think less parts would equate to a cheap fix.But I do understand your wanting to look at other options. Lexus seemed overpriced and stodgy to me - and everyone has one, it seems. BMW makes a nice car, as does Mercedes, but cost to own is high(love the new E class, though.. wish I could afford to own one). Audi's larger vehicles are gorgeous inside but also suffer from maintainance woes. The list quickly dwindles.I'd look at the Acura TL or possibly the CTS (you didn't specify sporty or luxury preference) Both can be had for about 32K through various sites like Truecar. It turns out they all are using the same back end call centers - I got a quote from Truecar and a couple of other sites recently and got the same receptionist on the phone (though different agents). So it works well enough to get an idea at least of the price locally. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Unlike pleko, I can give a better balanced impression on the Maxima since I have the new one and considered it heavily against the G37. There is plenty of reason to buy a Maxima and sales of the current gen prove that, but it depends on what your looking for specifically. If you don't have a family or a big family and want something with a luxury bad, better materials, and a sport firm ride/handling then the G37 is the one that makes the most sense. If your like me and want something that is more a roomier family sedan but with a sport look/flair to it then the Maxima fits the bill better. The maxima is much more comfortable inside and if you get the premium package you get the heated steering wheel, power rear sunshade, dual moonroof, cooled front seats, auto dimming side mirrors, sport bucket seats, and a couple of other goodies that you can even get on the G37. To me, the Maxima is the best handling FWD sedan I have ever driven to date. Its got a great turning circle for its size, just the right ride quality balance, and if driven properly, yields decent mpg with the CVT. Only thing is, if you've never had a CVT before, it's going to take you about 2-3 months to get used to it. It was odd at first, but after 1.5 years, it seems like normal to me and I have had zero problems with it in almost 17 miles. This gen max is a world's different from the last one and to me has a much more stand out body style then the G37 does but that vehicle itself is due for a redesign in 2012. I suggest you test drive both vehicles, like I did, and see which one suits your needs better. They are two different vehicles, despite what anyone else on here leads you to believe. "
"shipo","January 2011"," The single largest ""fail"" vis-?-vis the Maxima is that it is no longer available with a stick; the G37 can still be had with three pedals under the dash. "
"plekto","January 2011"," What got me was that the Maxima is only 3 inches longer than the G37 size-wise. It's mostly sheet metal. FWD and CVT makes it frankly into an Avalon or Lucerne clone - it's nice and spacious, but it has a serious problem competing with the big RWD luxury cars. "
"saratoga3","January 2011"," thanks for the replies, I drove the G but not the Max yet. I like a car with some room and the G was a little cramped. I did own a 01 Max that I loved, but the new ones are totally different.Also, have some concerns on gas mileage with the G but you give that up for performance. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," Have you driven the Hyundai Genesis? You really should. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," Sorry smarty, but if you cannot give a ""better balanced"" impression of something you paid $$$$ for, compared to a casual observer that hasn't spent any of their own $$$$ on a product.Having said that, I agree with pletko on a lot of points. The current-gen Maxima is a shell of a car that it used to be. The ""four-door Sports Car"" moniker than Nissan used for it is long since gone, and it's been replaced by a sedan that doesn't fit into any distinct category anymore. It's essentially NOT an entry-level lux sedan (as much as Nissan would like it to be) because the materials and fit-and-finish pales in comparison to G (which is essentially the same price). It's too expensive to be a viable midsize sedan, and why spend a few grand more for a nameplate when the Altima can be optioned similarly for a lower price?If you're looking for some room, the Caddy CTS is a good alternative, as well as the aforementioned Genesis. Also check out the Acura TL. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Nissan got rid of the stick b/c when they offered is NO one was buying it and it got the point that they were losing money on the ones they were spending the time making a stick available on. So you know what, we only have ourselves to blame for that one. Now that Nissan no longer has it everyone whines about it but no one was buying it when it was here. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," I don't think its suppose to be a big RWD luxury competitor b/c if it was then there would be practically zero difference between it and a G37. Yeah, the Max is only 3 inches longer but its almost 4 inches wider which is what makes the difference and gives it so much more room. The G37 is designed to be a cramped sports sedan like a 3 Series. If you think the FWD and CVT has turned it into a Avalon and Lucerne clone then you really know nothing about the car. The Maxima rides and handles 10x better than both those vehicles and isn't even close in any driving dynamics. Plus, despite having the CVT, I've been able to keep up with plenty of regular automatics and manuals with the car so its performance capabilities aren't void or completely handicapped b/c of it. That is just an excuse people use to not get the car. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," I don't need to be chastised b/c you don't agree with my assessment but I have much more experience then you do with both vehicles so give me a break. Your logic about the $$$$ factor makes no sense at all either. This coming from a guy who at the max (no pun intended) only test drove each vehicles for 10 minutes each. I test drove each vehicle 3 times and had a G as a loaner many times when my FX was in for routine maintenance. I actually agree with you that the Maxima is not a true 4DSC in its current set-up and that is not the fault of the car itself but Nissan's stupid marketing schemes which they still don't get but that is another subject. I don't think anybody but you placed it in the entry-level lux sedan segment b/c I sure as didn't say it was. It is classified typically as an upscale or premium sedan. Your comments tell me that you don't have a clue when it comes to either of these vehicles b/c the Maxima is not the same price as a G37. As I stated earlier, no one is paying near sticker for a fully loaded Maxima. Typically you can get one for $33-35k when its all said and done, while a G37 does not have as big of a reduction. I have seen most people getting them for $37-40k depending on how its loaded up. That's still a difference and price and there are many luxury sedan features your getting in the cheaper Maxima that you can't even get in the G sedan even loaded all the way up. Is the fit and finish the same as the G, of course not, but it doesn't pale in comparison as you claim it to be. Its the best interior Nissan has had on the Maxima ever and that says a lot considering the interior's they had pre 2007. I was worried that there wouldn't be a market for the new Max but there is and the sales success of it prove it. There are big differences between the Altima and Maxima now that warrants the higher price of the Max and its more refined in every way, I should know, I cross-shopped that as well with the Maxima. As I said, the Maxima has found a market niche as a sporty family sedan that can get great mpg for the power. Now if Infiniti ever decided to bring back a FWD sedan or coupe then your argument might have more value. "
"shipo","January 2011"," I don't think the situation is quite as simple as your explanation suggests. The Maxima used to be quite a sporty car relative to its competition in the market place, however, Nissan saw fit to supplant the Maxima in that market space with Infiniti G series while at the same time tarting up the Maxima to the point where only the barest smidgen of sporting intention remains. Did the tarting up process drive stick buyers away or did the lack of stick buyers force Nissan to tart the car up and take it into a different market segment? I suspect the former.Long story short, the Maxima is no longer qualified to compete in this segment, a segment of which it was a firm stake holder early in its earlier iterations. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," Well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainstream flagship sedan does. Problem with you logic is, the cars the Maxima competes with, Avalon, Azera Impala, Taurus, etc are not as sporty as the Maxima is and have sales not even close to it, except for the Impala which is just rent a car fodder. Its the sportiness for the competition in the market place it has right NOW. Is it has sporty as it used to be, no, but there is more than just a smidgen of sportiness left. The body style screams sport, the exhaust note screams sport, the acceleration is incredible, ride quality is definitely not Lexus cushy and gear toward the feedback side, and for FWD, it handles very responsively compared to the other FWD flagship sedans it competes with. I love how everyone says the maxima has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong, especially if you compared it to the big/bloaty boat the previous generation was and sales failure it was. This generation at least started going back in the right direction after where it had been from 2004-2008. It blends family sedan comfort with some sporty driving characteristics. Something that both the Altima and G37 do not both due at the same time. The G37 is complete sports car while the Altima is a boring comfortable family sedan. The Maxima bridges some of the characteristics of each of those cars nicely. "
"shipo","January 2011"," So sixty thousand customers makes the Maxima a contender in this category; how do you figure? True, it is sportier than an Impala; so what?Exhaust note? Geez, I've heard late model Cadillac land yachts that sound better. Even still, since when was exhaust note a metric for measuring sportiness? Wait-wait, I know; it's a measure among the crowd that likes to put far can mufflers on their tiny little econo cars. :PAcceleration? Here again, not exactly an attribute that is the exclusive domain of sporty cars. I mean really, a Dodge Ram pick-up with a Hemi in it will handily show its taillights to a Maxima.Long story short, the Maxima has been bloated up to be a nice grand touring car, nicer than Impalas and the like, but not a very good competitor to the cars that make up this class. I know you disagree, but even with those sixty-thousand souls in your back pocket, you're still not going to sell your argument. "
"jimbres","January 2011","  Well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainstream flagship sedan does. If you go back & read Shipo's post, you'll note that nowhere in it did he say that the Maxima isn't a strong seller - only that it's no longer considered a sport sedan as it once was. Problem with you[sic] logic is, the cars the Maxima competes with, Avalon, Azera Impala, Taurus, etc are not as sporty as the Maxima is and have sales not even close to it, except for the Impala which is just rent a car fodder.I don't see a problem with Shipo's logic here. If the Maxima's chief competition comes from cars that aren't perceived as sporty, then it would logically follow from that fact that the Maxima itself is not perceived as sporty. I love how everyone says the maxima has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong Once again, Shipo's argument doesn't rest on sales numbers. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," It's simple my friend. If there wasn't a market for it as you and other stated and it doesn't compete well in its class competition then it shouldn't sell well. Problem is it sells very well as I pointed out and almost every review I have read states its a huge improvement over the last generation Maxima.Do you hear an loud exhaust note on a Camry? and Accord? a Altima? a Avalon? no you don't. That's because there isn't anything sporty about them. Only vehicles that have sporty pretensions and characteristics would do that. Why would a manufacturer waste the time to design and do that if it wasn't suppose to sound aggressive? B/c they want it to have sporty characteristics. Acceleration, looks, handling, ride, etc are not attributes that make a sporty car? Your definition of what makes a sporty vehicle is puzzling to say the least. A Dodge Ram pick up with a Hemi in it will handily show it's taillights to a Maxima; so what? I would expect it to. Now your going off on crazy vehicle and engines comparisons. Talk about going all over the place. Actually, the Maxima has been decreased in size compared to its previous generation so it hasn't been bloated up. I'm puzzled as to what you think are the cars that make up this class? Since the Maxima is a premium mainstream flagship sedan then that is what class it is apart of. That means the car's in its class is the Impala, Taurus, Azera, and Avalon. It outsells and performs all those vehicles. Bottom line is, you don't even know what class of car the Maxima is in, despite the fact it is in the mainstream flagship sedan class, sells better than its competition, and is more aggressive and unique then those other vehicles as well. It's class has changed compared to 10 and 15 years ago and so has the rest of the car market. Infiniti didn't even have anything sporty 10-15 years ago so even with in Nissan itself there are different vehicles that they have to be careful they don't compete against. Your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the Maxima does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. Even with your put downs and contradictions, your still not going to sell your argument. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," I never said the Maxima was a sports sedan. I said it was sporty family sedan or put it another way, a family sedan with sport/aggressive characteristics. Actually his argument can rest on sales numbers him and others said that its not class competitive and there is no need or market for it. Sales numbers prove that there is a market for it or people wouldn't buy it in the numbers that they are. Second, saying that b/c the Maxima's chief competition come from cars that are not sporty thus making the Maxima itself not perceived as sporty is just a gross generalization and to me isn't logical b/c in each car class their is always one or two vehicles that are different or an exception in certain characteristics then others. That's what makes test driving so important since the Maxima is very different with its driving dynamics then the others in the mainstream flagship class. That is the class the Maxima is in now, and it competes extremely well. I don't care what class it was in 10 or 15 years ago. Have to accept that is has changed to what it is today.Take the entry-level lux class for instance. An ES350, C-Class, IS, A4 and Lacrosse are more on the dull, less sporty side of vehicles but the 3-Series and G37 are the polar opposite of that. That would make a huge assumption about those sport sedan vehicles that b/c its in a class with a majority of less sporty (or luxury focus vehicles) they are not sport sedans as well. That of course would be a wrong assumption just like it is about a Maxima not having sporty driving characteristics. "

"smarty666","January 2011"," If you had read the posts from the last day you would have seen that I had mentioned I had gotten a Maxima. I was trying to offer advice and information for the OP who wanted to know the difference between the G37 and Maxima since he was considering the two vehicles. Since I have the new Max and I test drove and weighed it heavily against the G37, I thought I could provide some valuable insight into the differences between the two vehicles since I made a similar decision and what the pros and cons of each vehicle was. That is what I tried to do. Instead, I got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it :confuse: Very puzzling statements considering its sales numbers and how the market/class segment it now occupies has changed very much from what it was 10-15 years ago. "
"jimbres","January 2011","  Instead, I got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it Well, I did reread the posts that you're referring to & I can't find any that criticize you personally for driving a Maxima. Shipo merely pointed out that the latest generation Max isn't available with a stick & that in his eyes it's not as sporty as the earlier versions. All he was doing was expressing his opinion, which he has a right to do, & you went after him with a shotgun. You're too thin-skinned.I'm going to pull rank on you - you've been a member only since '09, but I've been here since '98 - & suggest that you calm down & have a little fun.

Didn't I point this out to you once before?)No matter what you drive, someone, somewhere will have an opinion about it that you won't like. Shrug it off. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," Most excellent advice.No one's criticizing your children, your profession, your intellect - they're expressing a different opinion about whether your car is a class leader. Even if you post ONE more time that it sells well, the opinion will continue to differ. I've been around for ages as well, and I have yet to see anyone berated and argued into submitting to another member's opinion - I've seen them respond to fact, but opinion? No.The Hyundai Sonata is selling extremely well. Does that make it an ELLPS? No. That fact in no way detracts from the vehicles sales or appeal, but sales numbers do not indicate anything about the car apart from its appeal to consumers. Period.Let's avoid turning this discussion, and a very minor point within that discussion, into the Middle East conflict. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," I personally think the Maxima is a nice car. It just isn't an ELLPS and doesn't warrant so much real estate in this forum. Maybe you should create a new thread: Maxima vs. LaCrosse vs. Taurus vs. Genesis. "

"smarty666","January 2011"," That was what I was trying to do in the first place, give you information to try and help make a decision. It basically comes down to this, both vehicles serve two different purposes, one is not vastly superior to the other, it all depends on what your personal situation is and what one fits your needs and driving style better. That is what I made the decision on when I was choosing between the two. "
"savetheland","January 2011"," I never saw new Maxima in person. Nissan evidently does not want to participate in autoshows. Last one in San Jose for some reason had Infinitis on display, but not Nissans. I saw Maxima on the road though and it has presence while G looks kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. Anyway Infinity G is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has RWD after all. So it is not efficient as a family car. Well what I actually wanted to say that I went to Nissan website and took a look. Agree - interior does not look like luxury car but is pleasant enough. The point I want to make is that I compared it with closest competitors - Buick Regal and Lincoln MKZ - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. It does not look like competitor to Avalon or Taurus which are larger cars.Then I went to truecar.com and configured Maxima with all options and got price around $33,600 in Bay area - almost 6K discount from sticker price. Similarly equipped entry level luxury cars, like A4, MKZ, G37 cost around 36K-37K according to truecar.com. Regal is priced similar to Maxima with 2.0T turbo engine. BTW A4 has engine similar to Buick and MKZ as engine similar to Maxima, but better interior quality. And I guess Buick is to A4 (both are German cars) same as Maxima to G. With exception that it has better exterior design and higher quality interior than Maxima. I would certainly test drive and compare Regal to Maxima, Regal may prove to be more sporty car after all (though Opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. If you do not like G - CTS is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0L engine. True there is G25 Journey - but it is decontented car, it costs less. BMW is even smaller car than G and Lexus IS is smaller yet.I remember comparos where Maxima lost to Dodge Charger in its spoting intentions. Nissan after all is a large FWD car. I drove previous Maxima - it was smaller but no more sporty than base Mustang. I do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about Maxima. People use sport-sedan notion too often. I heard even Sonata called sport sedan which is absolutely ridiculous. "
"plekto","January 2011"," It is worth noting as well that the CTS is almost as good as a BMW 5 series in hard driving.(that said, 99% of us won't even get to those limits for either car) That base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isn't really necessary. The interior as well is almost identical to an Acura or Audi in how well it's thought out and how nice it is. It feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the G37 does that as well, I have to admit). The panoramic sunroof is awesome. And in a first for GM, the NAV system actually works.My only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the Civic, there are *zero* visual cues). But it's not alone in that, either. The worst offender currently is actually the new Honda Crosstour, which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. It also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a Cadillac to have a hood ornament. It's an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.Me, I don't parallel park if I can help it, so it's not an issue. Just something to be aware of.edit - truecar and cars direct say there are still some 2010 CTS models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32K if you don't mind black. (27.5K for a base model(29 with auto), 30K for the Luxury, 32K for the Performance, and 34K for the 3.6) Almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.But.. even a base model CTS for ~29K... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20K range drop off of my radar. Especially the emasculated Regal. Got to love year end fire sales at GM.  "

"smarty666","January 2011"," Well, the biggest problem I have with the G25 is the lack of certain features at its price point that Infiniti decided to charge for it. I think the TSX I4 with tech is a much better option at the same price point plus your getting a nav system in that vehicle. The mpg of the G25 is not really that great considering it is only 1mpg better in city/highway miles compared to a RWD G37. It should be a lot better than 1mpg considering the difference in engines between a G37 and G25. Plus, the deals people have been reporting on the G37 and G25 are not that much different from one another. The G37 is not that much more per month and your getting a heck of a lot more car for the money with the G37 then you are with the G25. The G25 basically serves the purpose of getting people into the Infiniti brand without too much bells and whistles about it. I still fee the G37 is a much better buy over the G25, obviously for the sport enthusiast as well. "

"roho1","January 2011"," I don't understand why my post was censored. I quoted right from Edmond's page that the NM was worthy of comparison. The discussion was interesting and informative to any one looking at a ELLPS. It ran it's course and the thread will move on. Looking beyond the box never hurt anyone when shopping for a vehicle. I thought Edmonds was better than this I just saw Motor trend uses as a gauge the snobbery factor to judge as in the G25 article linked here. Are we dealing with that here?I frequent the ""Toyota on the mend"" thread and all topics are allowed to be discussed over there, I guess that's where I'm coming from. Maybe a different moderator?Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, something I fought for. "
"shipo","January 2011"," Like it or don't, believe it or not, you have absolutely zero right to ""free speech"" on any and every private forum, this one included. "
"roadburner","January 2011"," Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, something I fought for. The First Amendment does not apply to private internet forums. Start your own board if you want to discuss anything you like- that's what a bunch of us did almost one decade ago... "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," If you can live without the extra options that the 37 offers, then by all means, take the 25. Considering that there's virtually NO difference between the cars besides the badges and the engines (same suspension, brakes, steering, and interior appointments), and driving impressions seem to be positive despite the lower HP, it's a good deal to get into an Infiniti instead of settling for a FWD TSX IMO. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," This is entirely accurate. A simple reading of the Constitution, rather than a re-phrasing of what one believes it to say, will provide illumination. Freedom of speech allows you the liberty to say whatever you want, without at the same time obligating ANYONE to provide you with a venue in which to say it.However, anyone who is truly committed to changing this can take the first step with me - We can drop by your friend's or relative's house (better yet... the boss!), stone drunk, with my accordion, and sit on their porch singing show tunes all night to proclaim our newly-defined right to Freedom of Speech. I joke, but the fact is that our topic-oriented discussions are just that. We allow you to discuss any vehicle-related topic that might be of interest - we just require that you do so in a discussion about that vehicle. New and old members alike should have some reasonable expectation that the majority of conversation centers around the topic in the discussion title, and/or around the vehicles listed in the discussion header. Some of the discussions in Auto News are looser and more fluid. Sedans discussions are vehicle(s)-specific.I have, at least twice, pointed to a perfectly good discussion to talk about the Maxima (plus there are Maxima-specific discussions). No reason that conversation can't be continued there, unless of course there's not enough interest, which would mean there's... just not enough interest in general. It's pretty clear that the Maxima does not, at this time, qualify as an ELLPS.And of course you are perfectly allowed to start your own message board - not every Forum style suits every person, and there is no One True Forum. Lots of people frequent a variety of fora, on a variety of topics. That's cool. Hey, we even started an Off-Topic board a few years ago, recognizing that sometimes people just want to chat about stuff other than cars. I think we've actually become more flexible over the past few years... who'd have thought we'd be swapping recipes, book and movie recommendations, political views, and travel ideas on a car site? "
"savetheland","January 2011"," I considered it too and found out that in real world G37 costs slightly more than G25 (like may 36K vs 33K). Its up to you what do you prefer, but if you are going to shell out 30 grands anyway does couple of grands make any difference? My only problem with G is that it is tight inside and looks cartoonish and misproportioned at the same time. But I am going to compare it to Regal 2.0T anyway. Acura ugliness keeps me away from it. Regal is European car and may be unreliable, thats my concern. What else. Volvo S60 - good reviews but even tighter than G and overpriced and I did not like interior, and not good reliability record either. I commute a lot so miles pile up quickly and if my car keeps breaking down often it is not okay, so CC and A4 go out of window too. Japanese better outsource designs to California studious otherwise there is almost nothing to consider. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," Wow, there are so many things in your post that I either don't agree with or just don't understand.G is tight inside? You do know this is the ELLPS thread, right? All of these sedans are small. If you need space, you should be shopping in another segment.Regal a European car? Sort of. The Buick Regal is the American version of the Opel Insignia, which is built by Opel, a GM owned company. There are lots of fine ""European"" American cars (Holden Commodore, Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Monaro, Opel Vectra), but to imply they might be unreliable because they are European is just ridiculous. Volvo S60 small and unreliable? Again, what's all this ""unreliable European car"" talk? I have owned many European cars over the years and didn't find them any more or less reliable than any other car. And how does the S60 have a poor reliability record when this is the first model year? And again, why do you think the S60 is tight? You do know Volvo also has something called the S80 for people who want more space, right?CC and A4 out the window too? Really, I assume they break down too much also?Japanese cars need California design? So, the G37 is ugly and so is the TL and TSX I assume? You do realize that you've eliminated every car in this discussion thread, right? May I suggest you start a new thread entitled, ""ELLPS BRAG"" (Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans that are Big Reliable And Good-looking). "

Just to tell people I don't like trucks? I wrote this in another forum with respect to BMWs, but I think it addresses the situation here as well:I have a Jeep TJ and I never post snotty comments on the Hummer or Land Rover boards. My TJ does what I want it to do and I don't need to justify my choice. Ditto for my Mazdaspeed3. I leave the guys in the GTI, MCS, Si, and WRX boards to their own devices. Again, why bother them? And as for my X3 and 3er, I feel no compulsion whatsoever to troll the Audi, Infiniti, Lexus, or MB boards. What's the point? The same goes for my Speed Triple. However, there always seems to be a few non-BMW owners who just have to yell ""Mine's bigger!"" in the Bimmer topics. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," i'm an owner of a new body g35x (not 37) and at the time they announced the g25 i was excited but since reading the stat lines on the car -mpg, performance, HP, and lack of manual it kind of confuses me a bit- I mean they should of put a turbo 4 in the car with stick 250 hp for that price -- or give it a v4/v6 that gets 30 mpg, for me this is a good looking car-- it turns and breaks well- the base 3 series has more hp and if you can find a base one with a 6speed it sounds like a better deal-- plus with the manual your looking at more power and more fun while in the same price range. i also think the selective editing gets old certainly when good points are being made- like why is the TSX in this category again but the Max is not?? same price range and fwd only difference is Acura vs Nissan nameplate. "
"Kirstie_H","January 2011"," Well, most of the time, we go on manufacturer specification. They call it a midsize sedan? OK, we do too. They call it a large sedan? We do too. I think you might find the conversation in our mainstream large sedans discussion interesting, as the interior measurements of the Maxima are smaller than the Altima. Would love your perspective there. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," Personally, I think the G25 is being targeted at IS250 buyers - namely, young upwardly mobile females looking to enter the ""luxury"" market. These buyers don't care about HP or manual transmissions. They're looking for styling and amenities.The TSX belongs here because, with the 6MT at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive cars in this category. I actually think it epitomizes the ELLPS segment right now. If you've never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers don't tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. I have driven very few cars where every part is in harmony with every other part. The engine, transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - it's just a joy to spend time with. It's not without faults, of course, but they disappear once you're rolling. It's like a symphony - seriously. I'll always remember mine as one of my favorites. "
"saratoga3","January 2011"," i am concerned with the G37 tranny issue, and from what I have been reading the G25 is not having these problems., that's why I was considering the 25. Also, my other option is a CPO G35X, since they don't have the 7 speed tranny. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," belongs here despite the fact that it is FWD (or as many call it, Wrong Wheel Drive). I thought the total package was much better overall than the MINI Cooper S (6MT) I test drove before it. I love how the suspension is tuned. I'm a die hard manual transmission guy & actually really like the way our TSX's automatic performs. Upshifts are smooth & crisp. Downshifts come when you want them too. Driving in M mode, the transmission WILL NOT upshift at the redline unless you select the next gear. It is also the most ENTRY LEVEL of the ELLPS. You can seriously own a TSX Tech for under $30K. Nobody else in this segment can touch that price. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," ... the Saab 9-5? Is that considered a ELLPS?Personally, I'm not a big fan of them, but the upcoming 9-5 SportCombi is actually a decent-looking wagon.IMO it's better-looking than the TSX wagon. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," one of those bad boys loaded up is well over $50K. That is NOT entry level by any sense of this board. "
"mz6greyghost","January 2011"," What exactly is the price ceiling then?Consider:A BMW 335i xDrive with options exceeds $55K.An Audi A4 can exceed $51K.A C-class (non-AMG) can also exceed $51K.Granted, the base price starts higher than the others (at $38,525, according to their website) but it's relatively well-equipped. "
"moonsky1","January 2011"," To me, the price ceiling would be $45K for a car equipped with typical options and navigation system for a luxury car. You know, leather, moonroof, xenon, heated seats, climate control, upgraded audio, auto-dimming mirrors, power seat and memory, those kind of things. So most Japanese ones qualify even if it's G37 or IS350, but not the German ones because they are too expensive. I would consider 9-5 to be in this segment too. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," Also isn't the entry level car in the Saab lineup, that would be the 9-3. I'll have to check, but I think the 9-5 competes with the 5 series & E class. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," +19-5 is too big and not entry-level. "
"moonsky1","January 2011"," Agree. Didn't know that it's almost as long as a Caravan. (Slight exaggeration, but it's definitely way bigger than any car in this category) "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," carguy and lawman.. the TSX i think its a great car for the money but luxury and performance are key factors to consider-- this is the same car sold overseas as the accord - they put leather and chrome in the car here and call it an acura-- msrp ranges from 30k to 39k (yes for a tsx with nav and a V6) and with deals i'm sure you can get a 6speed manual for around 28k which is a great price for a car like this. I have not driven the new tsx but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy - but performance in the current model do not match prev generations as this car has become a little bloated. The base sonada comes with 200 hp and you can get a 275hp turbo 4 for 25k that gets 33mpg highway- you would love to see acura ""advance"" a bit before the whole line becomes saab or volvo. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," couldn't agree with you more about the TSX and Acura as a whole! I do have to say that of the current Acura line-up, the TSX is the only vehicle I could see getting and the only one that I could tolerate the shield grill on. Let's hope Acura gets rid of that styling choice in the next generations of their vehicles! "
"cdnpinhead","January 2011"," . . .but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy. . .Still is for me -- the TSX manual is really fine. If the car put the power down via the rear wheels and had a 2 or 2.5 litre diesel I'd keep it until they put me in a home.As it is, I still haven't seen anything I like enough better to go for it. A Jetta or Golf TDI are possibilities, but I really enjoy the stone solid reliability of a Honda product.The transmission clicks nicely into each gear and is certainly the best one I've used since my MGB. Even though the B's tansmission lacked a synchronized first gear, the linkage had absolutely zero play in it and sat right on top of the transmission -- good times. The two Miatas and the 240Z I drove many miles had lots of good features, but the transmissions weren't the equal of the TSX or the B. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," the honda product reliability cant argue with that- and good to hear they didnt fuss with the tranny. Rare manual transmission driver, good job "
"nyccarguy","January 2011"," While the TSX V6 with Tech does go into the far reaches of the upper $30K range, they don't sell well & Acura puts big incentives on them to sell. The majority of TSXs out there are 4cyl. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," i'm sure thats the case with the 6 --. Acura should invest some money in the line- drop the 6 , clean up the grill, make a coupe?, and throw another 50 plus HP (or more) into a turbo 4, how about a 6speed auto. while keeping weight down..right now its a 4cyl pulling 3500 lbs with just 200hp and 170lbs.. might be nice to sit in but its not a performer in its current form (certainly if ordered with an 5 speed auto). sorry edmunds this current car does not meet ELLPS no matter what acura says on its press releases. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," It may not be quickest in the 1/4 mile, but the TSX with 4 cylinder engine and 6 speed manual is a delight to drive, and most definitely is an ELLPS. "
"sweendogy","January 2011"," sadly only 5% of the tsx market is sold in 6 speed form. "
"cdnpinhead","January 2011"," if one wants a manual transmission, it's time to go to work. They're rarely stocked, and when they are, they're liable to be loaded with s*** (let's say stuff) that I don't want. When I got mine, I checked inventories all over the West and finally ended up paying the local dimwits to truck one in from Denver that I couldn't see. Once that happens, serious bargaining goes out the window.Either way, I have my manual, and I enjoy it.Point being, if none are available for test drives, most people will give up. The same thing happens with BMW, among others.Chicken & egg. "
"fedlawman","January 2011"," My experience back in 04 was just the opposite.I wanted a 325i and tried to find one with just the sport package and manual transmission and couldn't find anything that wasn't fully loaded.Then, having read the favorable magazine reviews, I test drove the TSX 6MT and that was it - I never looked back. It was so tossable and playful, and had the slickest shifter and sweetest revving engine I had ever experienced - nicer even than the also excellent BMW. Ironically, I was totally satisfied with it until I took it to a couple of BMW club track days (where, BTW, I was able to keep pace with E46 330is and E36 M3's) and decided that I wanted RWD.Except for it being FWD, the TSX has almost the perfect mix of sportiness, luxury, and refinement. It was simply a pleasure to own - and for 90% of drivers (who don't take their cars to lapping days), FWD is no handicap. "
"nyccarguy","January 2011","  Coupes don't sell - That's why Honda KILLED OFF cars like the CL, RSX, & My Beloved Prelude. Another 50 Horsepower (The V6 TSX gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. The 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to Acura's FWD platform. The numbers don't tell the whole story. "

I've suffered NO torque steer, even when exiting a tight corner. The only tug I've felt with a FWD V6 is with an Altima 3.5SE I tested a few years ago.I've even driven the TSX V6, and felt that the power was nice, with no noticeable torque steer. Can't say that for the 4-cylinder, even with a manual. The power was adequate, but still felt noticeably weaker compared to the G and 3-series, and I wasn't about to drop $36K on a FWD sedan just for the V6 (which IMO is way overpriced just to get a bigger engine). "
"smarty666","January 2011"," The 6-spd is slowly being introduced right now. The ZDX and MDX have it and in a few months, the TL will have it with the 2012 update. I suspect that the TSX will get it in the next year or two. "

"
"flightnurse","March 2011"," For a Audi Forum I love how the TSX has taken over. I never understood why Acrua thought they needed a V6 in the TSX, never made sense. If they wanted more HP, then take the turbo engine from the RDX and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 HP range. This would give the TSX more HP without having some of the FWD turbo issues. Add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.Being back in school for my masters, I needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so I went with a 2010 Ford Fusion SE with 6 spd manual and the Appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with. I got 235/40/HR18 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24K OTD. It has a bigger back seat then the TSX and living here in Phoenix, the last thing I want in the summer time is leather. But I'll be looking for a new 2012 A4 once I'm done with school, the back seat is bigger then the TSX, BMW or C class. "

VW CC ? , Come on it isnt even close to an Infiniti in quality. The ES350 is a car for grandpa. The IS350 is actual a better competitor to the 335i, Acura TL and the G37 than the ES350.

"fedlawman","June 2011"," The ""growl"" of the engine in the G37 is different than the resonance from the tailpipe. It's the VQ's unrefined and rough sounding nature at higher revs that makes you think it's going to throw a rod every time you get it above 5000 RPM.BMW's inline 6 is one of the sweetest sounding, smoothest revving engines on the planet, and it's well worth the premium in price to have it.

Infiniti might be louder then BMW but again its different - i think infiniti was going for more of a muscle car sound at open throttle- we all can agree bmw is ahead when it comes to the class but infiniti is not far behind given the price points, the power, the sporty nature and quality. i own a infiniti g35x from 2007, actually looking for bmw 335xi sport 6 speed manual and would not be if infiniti put a 6 speed in awd form.

My parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for them.(though we have kids as well - heh). CPO 1-2 years old was also an option. Anyways, the short list was the TSX, the C Class, the CTS, the G37, and the IS250/350.TSX - this came in last place. It suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside, it still has a noisy engine and a feel to it that is pretty ""normal"". And the looks aren't that great. It has that smiley face look that only the Japanese can pull off. IS250/350 - Had a lot of the same issues as the TSX. Just sort of ""meh"", though a very nice and pretty car overall. But it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality. Like going to Cold Stone and getting just vanilla ice cream. Sure, it's superb, but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla. The prices of the TSX and IS also seemed a bit inflated. So that left the G37, G8, the C350, and the CTS. The G37 was good, but it really has an odd feel to it - it's a young person's weekend racer in a business suit. It doesn't feel as polished or refined as it should be, and perhaps that's because it is based upon the Z. It also has that dolled-up feel to it. I guess it was sitting in the M next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between luxury and just looking like it. You''d figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better cars instead of pimping out a lower brand...Great car to drive, though. Just was missing something.... It's kind of how I describe the Volvo S60 and Audi A4 - close but still feels off.It boiled down to two choices that were an absolute tie, the C class and the CTS. The CTS was what they eventually settled upon, but only because of the GM dollars that he had. It is a fantastic car all-around. The car drives great, handles great, and has a very nice interior. It's by far the best thing GM has ever made. My personal favorite, though, was the (new model) C350. It felt just about perfect in how it drove. The interior was also perfect as well - great seats, and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the E class and S class. I'd rate it as a slightly softer road feel of the 3 series. Both are within a few percent of each other. But the edge for luxury goes to Mercedes. The edge for performance goes to BMW. (note - the new E class sedan is based largely upon the C class - if you want something larger that is) "
"smarty666","June 2011"," Then your not a smart private seller. Who knows what conditions you had your vehicles in. Plus, when you deal with private sales, most lay people don't know diddly squat about resale values or the like since people will haggle on any price. If you didn't like the price they offered you then DON'T SELL IT TO THEM. Having a difficult buyer has nothing to do with the resale value of your Infiniti's, if you had them in excellent condition. A dealership wouldn't think twice of selling a used vehicle to you if they didn't make a profit. Lets just dismiss the cold hard facts that professional sources rate things on. I hope I'm not confusing you with logic and reason :confuse: "
"tlong","June 2011"," Plekto,Your story is interesting, thanks for that. This is exactly the market segment that I am interested in. I had a '98 A4, and I'm currently driving an '05 TL. If I were to replace that car today, a lot of the vehicles that you listed would be on my list. My thoughts:IS - don't particularly like Lexus or Toyota, this one is outTSX - I really liked the previous model, I sort of agree on the current one. Not as attractive, gotten too big, too soft and bloated. But a good value choice.A4 - is now too expensive. No 6 cyl choice.BMW - The 3 series is close, but BMW's have never quite done it for me. I guess I want a little higher mix of luxury and a bit more reasonable purchase price.CTS - I don't mind the looks, I'll take your word on the interior. I'm just not quite ready to buy GM - need to see longer term reliability and survivability of the company.S60 - I really like the looks, although I haven't sat in it or driven it. I'm shocked at how much it costs. Also not sure how the ownership changes of Volvo might affect things long term.C-class - too expensive. Also not sure I'm ready to have the MB stigma (how it looks to others). But given that, I think the C-class is BY FAR the most attractive car in the class. Given your comments on the interior, I have no doubt that this would be good as well. I think I'd consider getting a 2-3 yo one coming off a lease to save some money. And I think this is the one I'd eventually go to if I was going to leave my TL. It would have to be worth it, and the other cars on the list just aren't quite appealing enough at this time. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," Pletko, replying to you but a general reply to the board.I decided on the g37 and it is now in my possession. White, wheat interior, accents, nav, premium plus other stuff.

I'm pleased with the car. "

"plekto","June 2011"," I personally like the G37 the most out of that list, but it's because I could in theory get it with manual and I kind of like muscle cars. It's definitely not a proper luxury sedan, though.But for the price, it is also a good deal - at the end of the year, with incentives, we're talking about 3-4K more than an Accord V6 or Camry V6, and about the same price as a TSX. As an upscale family sedan, it is a fantastic alternative. ***As for the original poster's comments, yes, it took me a long time to get over the whole Mercedes stigma as well when I first owned one years ago.  They are fine cars and if it's any consolation to you, they carry a bit less stigma now than a typical BMW does. At least around here. The C 300 Luxury is probably the best compromise, though, since the sport is nice and all, but the interior of the Luxury is by far better. Just two things, though - one, you absolutely do want to add the rear spoiler to it as it makes the back end look more defined. And the panoramic sunroof is awesome looking with the Sandstone Beige. (it's tinted very dark black so it adds nice contrast) It's really the only color combo that the car looks best in, IMO, and I generally hate beige and tan colors. 35K all over town, so CPO at 25-30K is a snap.

In order to get a loaded G for 30K, the dealer needs to give you 14K discount (MSRP = $44k).The G37 Journey has almost the same exact options as a Camry V6. They dropped the base model as well and now relegate that to the G25 where it belongs. The G37 starts out at the mid level trim. Most of the options aren't really required, either, and the car rides far too hard with the sport tires or sport package. Hence why, IMO, it's not a real luxury car - though it is a good upscale sport sedan like the 3 series.Truecar has one for $32320 near me. And it's not the end of the year - there's no incentives going on right now. It's $27K even for a Camry V6 XLE (no options, either) - no incentives, ever. Like I said - it's a fantastic deal and a better replacement for the tired and boring Camry in any case. For 4-5K more, it's a no-brainer, really. It represents what I feel is the best value for the dollar currently on the market. And for 90% of people who have never had either a proper luxury car or a proper sports car, it's going to feel like they won the lottery compared to their old car.But for the original poster, it's not quite what he seems to want - he wants a step up from all of that.

You can't even get the same options on a G25 as are available on a CAMRY.I would rather drive the Camry in NY based on the last two winters than the G25 with RWD. "
"plekto","June 2011"," Well, if you don't put winter tires on the car, it will handle like junk no matter what it is. And the thing normally comes with summer tires which exacerbates the issue.http://editorial.autos.msn.com/listarticle.aspx?cp-documentid=1168211They say that less than 3% of U.S. tire sales are for winter tires. They tested a G37 with and without and the findings are surprising if you aren't familiar with these types of tires.Quote (MSN Autos):What About All-Wheel Drive?Often cited as the transportation cure for winter climates, all-wheel drive is far from a silver bullet. In previous tests, we've discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter rubber, but that's where the advantage ends. The additional traction of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to outbrake, outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. Of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car's handling balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. That's why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winterHere's a video of all season vs winter tires:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlYEMH10Z4sSo you should forget AWD and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead. If you live where you really get bad snow, that is. "
"gooddeal2","June 2011"," Yeb, I hardly find just a RWD here unless I want a MT. 99.9% of the Gs are AWD in Philly. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," I have plenty of snow experience. The awd on my subie worked flawlessly with all season tires in two feet of snow from the last few winters.I don't want to turn this into a debate on drivetrains and tires. But in the northeast there are a lot of cars on the road with awd.It easy to sit in LA and link to articles on tires and drivetrains. Why dont you spend a winter or ten in the northeast and get some practical experience with tires and drivetrains? "
"Kirstie_H","June 2011"," Heck, even going to Kansas City would do. Two winters with 40+ inches of snow each year switched me to 4WD in a heartbeat. No regrets. While it's all well and fine for people to keep giving ideas about how to turn a RWD sport sedan into a decent snow performer with better tires, etc., I can tell you that my 4WD vehicle outperforms my G35 in the snow, period. "
"plekto","June 2011"," Yet, you don't hear about people in Europe having problems with RWD Mercedes and BMWs being dangerous in the winter, do you? Winter tires are considered a normal thing in Germany and everyone uses them.It's really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be. The way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instantly fly off the road, cash, and explode if you don't cough up the extra thousands for an AWD system.Proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use. That video, btw, that I linked to was of a RWD BMW. Oh, and we do get snow in California. I didn't always live in So. Cal - there's tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state. And in all of that time, I never once considered what type of drive (FWD/RWD/4WD) the vehicle had when I purchased it. I adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation. "
"Kirstie_H","June 2011"," I didn't pay thousands extra for my AWD vehicle, and I didn't see anyone allude that your RWD will fly instantly off the road. Just that AWD performs better. Ever live in Europe? I'm guessing not. I have. It's a bit silly to lump all of Europe into a single category, because some areas get almost no snow, but anyway... not everyone in Germany drives a RWD vehicle, and I'm not sure it would make international news if some of those who did had trouble in the snow. I will say that much of England pretty much shuts down if there's 2"" of snow - could we attribute that to the prevalence of RWD vehicles in Europe? I doubt it, but that debate point makes as much sense as your point about ""not hearing about BMWs/Mercedes flying off the road in Germany.""As I said, talk all you want. We've had two RWD vehicles at the same time in winter, and 2 AWD vehicles at that same time. I'm going to choose the AWD vehicle in heavy snow 100% of the time, even if you tell me yet another time how RWD is a non-issue if you have proper tires and driving skills. "
"plekto","June 2011"," Well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with AWD. Does it actually work? Most systems actually are only good for slow speeds and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. If the system transfers power back and forth and isn't engaged all of the time, it's useless for most bad conditions unless the power ratios are set up correctly. Most manufacturers get this horribly wrong. The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distribution. (0/100 under default conditions). It's basically fancy version of stability control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from videos of the system in action that I have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computer's AI to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)Too slow to be useful at normal driving speeds except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head. There are numerous articles and videos out there about half-baked AWD systems, so I'll not go into this further.The other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages. Is it worth it? Probably not. It's certainly not full-time AWD like Audi and Subaru use. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," The G37 in question costs $1500 more for the AWD version, but it performs almost the same as the RWD version due to the power distributionIt may perform the same but I'll bet it doesn't react the same. What I want out of my AWD system is not to have to worry about powering through deep drifts. I want to be able to step on the gas gently and have all four tires partipate in gingerly moving the car without throwing it into a skid.With RWD with snows, gingerly is not in the equation. It doesn't matter whose system is better, I want the system to be just good enough so I won't get stuck.The ATTESA has been written up for the last several years as the best performance AWD.Come this winter I will find out. "
"tlong","June 2011"," Don't forget that AWD doesn't do anything for braking. It can get you moving in slick conditions, but to get stopped - well all cars brake on all four wheels. "

"tlong","June 2011"," Don't see how your comment is relevant to my comment. :surprise: "
"plekto","June 2011"," Yeah.. as I've said numerous times before if you are THAT concerned with snow, just get 4x4 as it actually does work like it should. I can guarantee that my friend's 4Runner will outperform almost any AWD system on almost any surface.But of course, it's big, expensive, and eats lots of gas and all of that... And you can't use the 4x4 mode on pavement. Then again, you really don't NEED to given how well it drives. "
"ivan_99","June 2011","  I vote for a boat-car...imagine the possibilities.Plus safety... "
"plekto","June 2011"," Heh.Of course, I was being a little bit sarcastic there. :P But I think I also have a valid point in that if you are looking for a ""luxury performance sedan"", AWD is a minor concern compared to all of the other factors. Because the fact is that most of them will be RWD or heavily RWD biased anyways. You will need winter tires if you want to drive it during the winter months.It just makes more sense to spend the extra $1500 on a second set of rims and winter tires and just swap them every 6 months or so. "
"kdshapiro","June 2011"," None of these cars are being raced at nascar. Even the 750 comes with awd these days.Meh I would rather go for the awd instead of a second set of rims. Awd is more useful in more situations than two plus snows.10 years I probably would have been preaching being a purist. Now I just want to enjoy my ride and I don't care if I'm getting the last ounce of performance from it. Or if the awd system is front biased, rear biased, full time or part time. I just don't want to get stuck.As an aside 4 snow tires on an awd car can out everything a rwd car in slick conditions. "
"nyccarguy","June 2011"," I'm with you regarding AWD. I've seen all the tests & read all the arguments. I know that a RWD car equipped with snow tires & all of today's electronic nannies will be lighter and therefore brake better & outmaneuver the exact same car with all season tires & AWD. 2 of my 3 cars ('01 Prelude & '10 TSX) are FWD and I equip them with 4 snow tires during the winter months. Do the snow tires provide phenomenal grip & awesome traction in the white stuff? Absolutely. Are they perfect? No.Changing over isn't that simple, nor is it cheap. My Prelude has a dedicated set of 15"" steel wheels which the snow tires are mounted on. I store them where I work and have the changeover done by a ""Fix-A-Flat"" place up the block. They charge me $30 each time I changeover. I didn't buy an extra set of wheels for my TSX, just a set of snow tires. I have to jam 3 tires into the trunk and put one in the front seat. My Acura dealer charges $100 for a snow tire changeover that includes dismounting, remounting, & balancing.They don't plow particularly well where I live in Stamford, CT (10 miles from the NY State border), nor do they salt due to the high concentration of well water. This past winter was particularly bad, but I can see how AWD can and will be useful in the future.Every BMW & Mercedes-Benz that's not an ///M (besides the X5 M & X6 M) or AMG, 6, Z4, SL, or SLK is All Wheel Drive that I see in NY & CT.Besides, my mere average driving skills won't let me squeeze the all out performance out of a RWD, SP Equipped BMW anyway.

The Acura will be bulletproof from a reliability standpoint, as are all Hondas, plus which the '08s don't have that horrible beak that started the following year -- very nice looking car. I'd probably be driving a TL Type S today if the rear seats folded down, which they don't. As a result, I have an '08 TSX that I really like, except for the fact that the wrong pair of wheels is being driven, which brings us to . . .The G35. I've had great luck with Nissan over the decades, and lots of people enjoy the G series. Rear-wheel-drive has a number of advantages in a performance-oriented car, but the engine in this guy is the same one they use across the board, from the Pathfinder to the Z-car. It's a bit thirsty and noisy I'm told, but solid as a rock. Our '04 Pathfinder has over 106K miles on it and has had absolutely no issues at all beyond a couple of little things related to the parking brake.Enjoy your search.

Neither handle as well as the G35s.I've owned a TL and an MDX in the past and had transmission problems with both. Acura still has many transmission issues. They are front wheel drive and while not as bad as some FWDs, they handle a bit jittery. You can't beat rear wheel drive cars like the G35s. The Gs only revert to all wheel drive when it detects slippage.The Maxima is a nice car but is front wheel and also is a bit jittery in the handling dept.

"2233","August 2011"," The run flat tires are a deal breaker for me. I recently drove the 328xi and the X3. Both were very nice. Most posters say the run flats are loud, expensive, and do not handle as well as non run flats. Most dealerships and tire stores do not stock run flats. If you get a flat tire, you can drive it 100 or so miles but it then must be replaced, not repaired. If you are several hundred miles from home, especially on a weekend, you will be stranded for up to 3 days waiting for the expensive tire to arrive at the dealer or tire store. You can change the tires to non run flats, but the storing of a spare could be problematic since no space is alloted for a spare.I would rate the G37 first of the ones you mentioned. Great handling, good looking, and very reliable. The TL would be the last vehicle I'd buy. I've owned 2 Acuras but never again. The C class is nice but reliabilty problems are a concern. "

"nyccarguy","August 2011"," It all depends on your driving style & what is important to you (performance, style, interior comfort, features, trunk space, rear passenger space, driving dynamics...). Especially if you are leasing, all the cars you mentioned will be covered by their respective factory warranties for the duration of your lease (& probably beyond). Reliability should pretty much a non-issue.Mercedes has been running some insanely cheap lease deals lately. Especially on leftover 2011 C300 4Matics (the most popular C around here).I'm a pretty big fan of Hondas. We own 3. Yes the TL is nose heavy & is front wheel drive, but Acuras drive pretty nice. They are ""sporty."" They are far from floaty, but very comfortable. Interior appointments are fantastic, it offers generous front & rear accomodations, a decent sized trunk, lots of tech for the dollar. Im curious as to why the OP is checking out the G37 as opposed to the G25 as well. The G37X is a bonafide road rocket. You get 326 hp and a proper RWD chassis. Even though the X denotes AWD, it is still RWD most of the time. Infiniti has some seriously good factory backed leasing. Coupled with a $1000 dealer incentive (not customer incentive) & 2% holdback, you can lease one very cheap. How good is the G37X? I'm trying to convince my wife that we should dump our perfectly good 2010 TSX (bought 8/29/09) with 39K miles and 3 years left to payoff so I can lease the G37X & save $100 a month as opposed to driving the TSX until the wheels fall off.Definitely check out the BMW 328i. The 3 series is a fantastic driver's car. Very sharp reflexes. Excellent driving dynamics. It is a little tight in the back seat & the trunk is tiny too.Good luck & keep us posted with what you get. "
"2233","August 2011"," I would agree that the mileage on the G 37 is not great but you are driving a forced induction muscle car of sorts. On the expressway, I get 23 mpg.We have a 04 G35X and a 07 G35X. The exhaust on the 2004 is definitely loud but I hardly notice the exhaust on the newer 2007. I notice the exhaust more now that I replaced the tires with Michelins on the 04. There is a clear difference in the newer Gs re the exhaust sound. You may not even notice the exhaust on the new Gs. I will probably buy an EX35 soon. I want something small with folding seats. Some consider this a G37 with a little more storage. The EX is something to consider even though it is technically not a sedan but the smallest crossover on the market. Infiniti has some nice incentives now. "
"qbrozen","August 2011"," it is not forced induction, FYI. Forced induction means supercharger or turbocharger, of which the G37 has neither. "
"2233","August 2011"," You are correct. I misspoke re the forced induction. I've read numerous posts re forced induction mods on the G. I guess I meant to say that the G is a beast even without forced induction which several competitors use such as the BMW 335. "
"shabadoo25","August 2011"," Not driving a 3 series because of the tires is ludicrous. Get an 08 or 09 335i. "
"2233","August 2011"," The abilities and liabilities of the tires are pretty important to most. There is no room for a spare in the X3 if you switch out the tires to non run flats. The interior of the current 3 series is very dated but the X3 interior is a huge improvement.There are many posters on the BMW sites that do not care for the run flats, although some do like the fact that they generally won't have to change a flat tire. Getting stranded if you are out of state is a big concern in addition to the noise and poorer handling.That being said, I love the handling of the current 3 series. I actually considered the E91 until I saw the interior. It also has run flats. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," I totally understand about those BMW run-flats. All the German companies are ruining their cars...I was all set to get a Porsche 911 until I noticed that the passenger side windshield wiper arm was an inch too short.  "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," You do realize that there are these places called ""tire stores?"" "
"nyccarguy","August 2011"," Hey fedlawman! Good to see you are still around my friend. "
"2233","August 2011"," I checked several national tire stores in my area and none stock the runflats. According to several posters on the BMW sites, most dealerships do not stock them.So if you don't travel out of state you're ok with the run flats.I guess you didn't do your homework researching this. Please go ahead and buy a car with run flats. Take some reading material with you if you go out of state because you may get stranded. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," Who said anything about buying run-flats?Replace the run-flats with a proper set of Michelin Pilot Sports.Buy a donut spare or a can of fix-a-flat for the trunk. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," You too NYC! By the way, don't get the G - too much of a lateral move from the Acura, IMHO :blush: "
"ivan_99","August 2011"," Me too...what's up with the Germans...I was all ready to sign for my new 911 and they didn't have a license plate holder...I turned around and walked out. "
"2233","August 2011"," I may have mistakenly thought you were advocating run flats.Another poster implied that German car companies other than BMW use run flats often. In fact, few other than BMW use only run flats. Porsche had them years ago on the 959. This site has arguments both ways for the run flats but the majority of these owners are against the use of them http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/06/run-flat-tires-.htmlI considered taking the run flats off a new X3 if I purchased one but there is no convenient place for the spare except taking up space in the smallish space behind the rear seat.They are loud, do not handle as well in the opinion of many, cost almost double, do not last as long and if is difficult to find them in stock.Car makers should make the run flats optional.I like the G37 of all the fine cars mentioned here. It's probably the least expensive, has the great VQ engine, is good looking, handles well, is reliable, and is rear wheel drive (or all wheel drive). The ride of the TL is a different type of ride which I do not like. I've owned several Acuras but will never even consider these again due to their ongoing transmission issues.My second choice would be a current 3 series but I would ditch the run flats as soon as they wear out.....probably around 15,000. I'd replace them with Michelins. The donut spare could fit in the trunk. "
"2233","August 2011"," Your Porsche ""analogy"" is weak and poorly researched.None of the current Porsches come with run flat tires. I wonder why this German company stopped using them? "
"carnaught","August 2011"," My run-flats were still going strong when I traded the car in with 36,000+ mi. on them. Although I would have preferred go-flats instead, I was appreciative of having them when I got a flat and could drive to a Discount Tire to have it repaired. Yes, I know they are not always reparable. "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," Sorry, it's not that my research was poor, it's that you aren't following my logic. Here, I'll spell it out...Rejecting a BMW because you don't like the tires is akin to rejecting a Porsche because the windows aren't tinted dark enough. And while it's true Porsche's don't have run-flats, it's also true that 911's (and Boxsters & Caymans) don't come with a spare tire. Off topic, but I thought you should know that there are 100's of thousands of drivers buying cars in North America without a spare tire (no, not just Porsche's - Chevy does it too). "
"nyccarguy","August 2011"," Fedlawman - don't know if ya heard, but the TSX is now my daily driver. I inherited it from my wife who is now pregnant with #3, who will be daughter #1. I bought her a Pilot, I drive the TSX to work 5 days a week & the Prelude 1 day a week.Lateral? Ya think? 326 hp in my dd would be nice, but I have trouble keeping my two 200 horsepower 4cyl cars under 90;) "
"fedlawman","August 2011"," #3! Wow, you've been busy! Cold winter?Well, of course it's not lateral in terms of HP, but in terms of refinement, balance, and poise, it certainly is (arguably a step down).Of course, HP was never my first priority anyways - I mean, I do drive a 4-cylinder too... On the other hand, the TSX and Prelude are kissing cousins. Maybe you're looking for something completely different? I can understand that.Well, good luck with whatever you decide to do. I've pretty much decided that my next car will be a 911. Just waiting for the right time and car to come along. "
"kyfdx","August 2011"," Can I have that crappy 4-banger, when you get the 911? "
"fedlawman","August 2011","  "
"2233","August 2011"," I understood your logic sir but I guess I consider the qualities of tires way more important than license plates, tinting, or a windshield wiper.I never had a car with run flats and I don't think I ever will until there are substantial improvements in them.Some people really like them so that's what is nice about these forums. Everyone can list the pros and cons and one can make their own decision. "
"plekto","August 2011"," The interesting thing is that these cars are in the same list.One is a large front wheel drive sofa on wheels that is trying to be a better Buick (and largely succeeding as well, I have to admit)One is a small luxury sedan that's extremely understated. A sleeper designed for people who really don't want to show off their money.One is a blinged-out rear wheel drive muscle car. A luxury 370Z to be exact.They all are great vehicles by themselves, but they also are completely different at heart. Honestly I need more information from the original poster because as it is, there is no real connection between the three besides price. Do you want luxury and refinement? Speed and power? A mix of the two? Do you want manual? What about size and weight?For example, if you wanted a luxury barge, then you should be looking at the TL, something from Lexus, or possibly a larger Buick or Cadillac. There's nothing wrong with wanting that (my current car is one - I hate small cars in Los Angeles traffic)If you want smaller and sporty, the G37, the CTS, and the 3 series all come to mind as top choices.If you want refined luxury, the Mercedes, Audi, and the Lexus IS(or possibly the GS) are top choices. "
"Kirstie_H","August 2011"," There are discussions about RFTs and non-RFTs all over the place in the forums. This isn't one of them. Let's not get too sidetracked on this conversation. A little bit, when relevant, is fine, but let's keep the focus on the cars that are on-topic here. "
"wireless","August 2011"," Just ordered a 2012 C-350...IS - The Toyota driving experience is just really bad for me. Terribly numb, bloaty, wallowey. Haven't driven an IS but the styling, like most Japanese cars is derivative. It yells ""Me too."" I understand it will be sporty but the Toyota roots are there. I've owned two Toyotas. Will not buy a third.TSX - Wow where did Acura take such a wrong turn with styling? Just uncomfortable to look at. Nutty smiley face and weird rear end. What are they thinking? Cringeworthy. Acura never was that great at style. They've completely gone off the deep end. And Honda used be run by the engineers. Too bad.A4 - good car and I could get a huge discount, better than employee's due the company I work for. Wanted to love this car. Thought it would be the one. Even got the discount all lined up. Interior has slipped a bit for Audi. Good car, but not much of an upgrade over the Passat I have. Actually like the Passat more - inside and out. The Audi has a couple of cool features, best styling but driving it just didn't do anything for us. Also I've heard a lot about the repairs especially the turbo, e.g,, ""cripplingly expensive."" BMW - We drove the 330 and just don't get it. Distinctly downscale interior, drove fairly well. Honestly on this one I'll take a mulligan. I will allow that it is probably a great car, it wouldn't get all the accolades otherwise. For now neither my wife nor I get it. Just at a loss on this one.CTS - Looks ok. Interior good. Doesn't get good reviews. Just don't trust this car to be reliable, and stand the test of time in styling.S60 - I would be interested in a Volvo before Ford bought them. Now just like Jag, and the other PAG cars they have Ford parts running through them. Platforms, switchgear, engines. Like Saab and GM. You're buying a lot of Ford at an Volvo price. I like Ford... but at Ford prices. Also heard resale is bad as well as reliability. C-class - we ordered the C-350. Drove this vehicle and within literally seconds I knew it was something different. Easily the best car I've ever driven. In every way, the sounds it makes, the way it feels, the way it takes corners, everything felt perfect. My wife felt the same way. Way better than the Audi or Bimmer. I know it sounds implausible but it the difference is stark. The price is on up there but I'm at a stage in my life where I can swing it. We even drove the E-class but since my wife will be the primary driver, the C is best for her, easy to handle and toss around, more fun to drive, etc. Only concern is the German electronics after 5 or 10 years. "
"qbrozen","August 2011"," BMW 330: did you drive a used one? Cause the 330 isn't made anymore.S60: ford parts? I don't know who told you that, but it is not true. The only thing ford/Volvo shared were basic platforms, and even those were not ""ford products"" since they were jointly developed. There are no shared engines at all. Volvo always continued making their cars in Sweden with their own engineering. Under their new Chinese owners, that continues to be the case for now, too. "
"wireless","August 2011"," The Bimmer was a 328. Still same impressions apply.As far as the Volvo goes: trim pieces, steering wheel, tires, wheels, seats, some emissions parts, etc. The may not be interchangeable but the same company makes parts for both. And while I agree that much may be substantially different, one cheap turn signal stalk is a real turn off. Resale value is said to be terrible, so used are a great deal. "
"carnaught","August 2011"," Are there any changes to the 2012 C350? "
"wireless","August 2011"," Yes, quite a few. MB say over 2000 changes. Big changes are the engine 268 hp to 302, direct injection, 10% better gas mileage, the interior was substantially upgraded, one review said it is better than the E class now. Just do a little research and you'll see the reviews. I haven't seen it in person yet. We drove the 2011. The 2011 wasn't bad but they say the '12 is a lot better. Read the Car and Driver review for more info. "
"plekto","August 2011"," I've been impressed by Mercedes as of late. Usually you had to get the S to get the top end engineering and reliability. And they were and still are incredible cars. The C class feels like a half-sized S class. And the difference is more stark if you just do something as simple as let a new TSX and a C idle next to each other. One sounds like it is made out of tin cans by comparison. Now, the Honda *is* a great engine, but it lacks that polished sound and feel that you'd get in, say, a Porsche or other high end car. It's exactly like thinking that your American made Fender Stratocaster is a great guitar (which it is) and then getting your hands on a true custom guitar. The goalposts simply moved without you realizing it, and now you're a bit ruined in your expectations. For the price, especially with year-end rebates, the C is becoming a very good deal.The other car that impresses me is the CTS. Reliability is excellent as far as I can tell, aside from the yahoos who break their CTS-V models' engines and rear diffs and then blame it on the manufacturer. My father has one and it sounds and drives 2-3 times better than any other GM car that he's ever had or driven.The IS and TSX and the rest simply feel dated. "
"carnaught","August 2011"," Sounds like a nice car. Is the body changed for 2012? Was it custom ordered? When do you get it? "
"wireless","August 2011"," Every piece of plastic was changed on the C-class. :]I ordered it with what I wanted. Not many options actually. The C-350 is pretty loaded to start with. I added keylessGO and 18"" AMG Rims. It's supposed to start production in the first ""decade"" (10 days) of October and be delivered in early November. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Not too sure why you drove a 328i and a C350, since they aren't comparable. YOu needed to drive the 335i since it makes the came HP as the C350, but the 335i is much faster, handles and is a better car overall then the C350.You stated the A4 interior has slipped, how so? Since all mag's have ranked the interior of the A4 has best in class for the last 5 years, the fit and finish is above that of BMW and MB.I almost got a A4 but the BMW made a much better deal for me, so I bought a 2011 BMW 328i with6spd manuelvalue packageLe Mans Blue MetalicChest Nut Brown leatherM sport package (it comes with the color)Moon roofXenon headlightsComfort Access keyless entrypaid $39K out the door.I looked at MB, but the price for a C300 but MG does not offer a sport package (one os standard on the C300 but its only an apparence package) on its entry level C class. Plus the local MB dealer wasn't really dealing, which wasn't a smarl move since the 2012 is a new C class.I'm very happy with my car, it handles well, its comfortable, and I love the manuel in the car. My next BMW will be a used 335d, I can't justify the price of a new one. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Awesome that you bought a 328i with a stick & sports Pkg! Enjoy! You had to special order that car, right? "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," There has been some discussion about the value of the scheduled maintenance. While it is built into the price of the car and we all know it isn't free, it is worth something.My 2010 TSX is 2 years old and has almost 40,000 miles. While I don't have all the paperwork in front of me, here's what I've done from memory:Synthetic Oil changes at 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K, & (almost) 40K @ $70 a piece at the dealership.Tire Rotations at the same intervals @ $30 a pieceI had to have the rear brake pads replaced & the front rotors resurfaced & cut.I just had the air filter & cabin filter changed @ $149. "
"plekto","September 2011"," Well, this is kind of to be expected since it is the new Accord, after all.Yes, there is no TSX in Japan. It's sold as the Accord over there. They ship the same car over here and slap an Acura badge on it and add a lot of markup.What we get as the ""Accord"" over here is actually an in-between model that they've never sold in the U.S. before. It's called the Inspire in Japan.It's also why the TSX simply doesn't belong in this discussion, as well. It's kind of like how Cadillac tried to push the Catera as a luxury car years ago when it really was a compact commuter box with some bling and badges added. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," Agree with everything you've said. I think we can create an entire thread to this one discussion ""What is an Entry Level Performance Sedan"".For those of us that like to argue in circles...We could easily argue why Kia and VW should be 'ahead' of many of these.Of course this always touches on raw emotions...your car is not good enough...it's a chick car...which borders on 'mother' comments  "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I actually drove a loaded V6 Accord back to back with the ""same car over here with an Acura badge on it.""Their price tags were remarkably similar. I know underneath my TSX sits on the Accord platform and is sold in Europe as an Accord.Besides the V6 Accord's extra ""punch,"" I prefered everything about the TSX. The suspension tuning is sportier on the TSX. My TSX has thicker anti-roll bars. The seats are comfortable and very thickly bolstered. It drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH. For a FWD platform, they did a damn good job. Is it a 3 series? No? Did I like it better than the A4 2.0T w/ Quattro I drove? Yes. Does it belong in this discussion? Absolutely. "
"billyperksii","September 2011"," I love Acuras/Hondas but the TSX is not Entry Level Luxury, it sits between everyday family sedan (accords, camrys) and the entry level luxury (TL, A4 3series)- not quite there yet. "
"m6user","September 2011"," You could say the same thing about the 3 series. Leather is optional on the 3 as well as many things that are standard on the TSX. Acura is a luxury brand. TSX is the entry level car at Acura. What part of ""entry level"" is so hard to understand. The TSX fits the definition perfectly. The G25 is the entry level at Infinti and the A4 at Audi. HP is about the same as as well and without turbocharging. The Skyline is a family sedan in Japan but the same car here is a luxury sport sedan, G37. I don't think anyone argues that the G series is not an entry level luxury sedan. "
"wireless","September 2011"," Price-wise the 328 you bought and the c350 are comparable. If you can't drive a 2011 off the lot for under $40k right now you need to go to another dealer. But yeah, some MB dealers don't deal much. They just don't need to. But the engine while nice wasn't what sold me. It's for my wife so it is not much about the engine.  We like everything else. I sort of understand the Bimmer, it's kind of glued to the ground but it just felt heavier where the MB felt spry, light on it's feet, but very direct-able and responsive. The Bimmer didn't fell any faster and I drove it fast on traffic circles, etc.  The BMW interior was just not good at all. The dash alone took it right off our list. What are they thinking with respect to competition? So dated. I will give the A4 this - its interior was better than the BMW's but the driving feel and interior did not flow. I recall the Audi's interiors easily being industry leading from the early 90s until the early 2000s. Don't know what happened but the interior now reminds me of mid-90s VW which was pretty nice but Audi's are not what they used to be. There's no art to them. BTW, the sport package on the MB includes a lowered suspension and a stiffer suspension. Not much else except as you note styling. But the styling is youthful. Nearly all the sell are the sport version. The salesman said they don't even order the C in the luxury version. Same with the E-class.Glad to hear your happy with your Bimmer. They're are many BMWs in my neighborhood, lot of men and women have them. Only a couple of MBs. I think the crowd in their 30s like the image BMW portrays. Certainly more younger that MB. Styling is good on many models. No problem with that. I like German car handling and design intent. I say buy whatever turns your crank! "
"shabadoo25","September 2011"," Sounds like you and your wife are more impressed with bells and whistles than the driving experience. Nothing wrong with that, but the new Kia Optima blows the luxury class away with cabin toys. BMWs appeal to a sportier driving populace that cares less about handbag hooks than they do about performance on a twisty road. "
"smarty666","September 2011"," Agreed, cars like the TSX, G25, etc all belong in this discussion because they are entry level luxury sedans. They have four doors, and come from luxury divisions and hence why the auto industry classifies them as such. Just because someone else doesn't think so does not make it so. Let them keep telling themselves that. "
"ivan_99","September 2011"," I suppose that makes some sense.It's a grey area with me.When I see ""Entry level Luxury Performance Sedan"" I don't automatically think of the lowest model that a manufacturer offers.So I'd say No to the TSX, IS250, G25, etc...the TL would be the representative for Acura's 'entry level', the IS350 would represent Lexus, G37 etc...I don't recall...is there a price cap? Otherwise would the Panamera be the 'entry level'... "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," No the car was on the lot, reason why I got the deal was, people who get 328's want an Auto, this car had been sitting on the lot for a while. Infact you can't order 2011's only 2012s. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," There is more to the free maintenance then what you are writing! It also comes with a bumperto bumper warranty too. So everything is covered except gas, tires and insurnace  My 2005 BMW 330i with the ZPH package was used hard and the clutch was replaced without a problem from BMW, as well as brakes. Its nice to be able to drive in, and drive out with a loaner BMW and have your car worked on for nothing. BMW has done it right, its keeps the cars uptodate on its services so the value of the car keep says high.Next year we are ordering a 535i and doing the European Delivery so we can enjoy the car in the motherland.

"wireless","September 2011"," Do you think leather is better than leatherette? I would say yes, but recently reconsidered. Leather, especially not top-of-the-line premium leather degrades after four or five years (depending on conditions of course). Leatherette can be cleaned with 409. "

"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," I've recently driven each of the cars that are considered in this category and I can't yet make a decision. Since this is my first foray into luxury I really didn't want to find myself regretting my choice in cars. I set out to look at the TSX, IS250, 328i, A4, & G37. After reading some things I added the C300 to the list, which you'll hear about. I am looking for people's input into my decision as I'm still unsure and I'd like to hear how you've liked the brand you chose and its cost to own. I'm scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car. And I'd rather not ""feel the road"" which sounds redundant owning a small car but if I can feel every bump then I may as well buy another corolla and deal with the potholes in Jersey. I was most hopeful going in about the IS from Lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current corolla from 2005. I hit my head on the roof while driving (I'm only 6ft tall) and i'm a big guy but the cabin felt cramped. Every time I talked to the salesman he acted like I was making a mistake not buying a bigger car. Do no salesman just listen to what you're saying about preference? That car is now off the list and will remain there.I drove the G37 and thought it was a very nice car. It felt ""classy"" inside and, I guess sterile is the word that comes to mind. I actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group. I hate the idea that driving a small car means you can't drive more than 2 adults around. It was about $35 fully loaded with the backup camera and nav and awd, which is cheaper than the competitors. I didn't like the salesman (and his pushiness) but that won't totally sway my decision. I think it drove ok although not as well as the Audi, BMW or the MB. Additionally my mechanic loves these cars and says they are the most reliable. I'm a bit unsure still though because I don't want Nissan parts in my luxury car. Its still on the list. If I can't justify the extra $5k or so then I'll end up in G37 if I had to guess. "
"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," I next drove the TSX. I thought the TSX felt like an Accord. I'm not sure if there is a significant difference in the parts between them but it didn't feel very ""luxury"". I liked that most of everything was included as it didn't feel like you were getting ripped off for everything. I liked that it had a back=up camera (the only real option) with the nav system. And I definitely liked that the car cost less than its competitors. I just don't think I'm going to be able to get off of the lack of feel. Unless it becomes a numbers play in which case this will definitely be in the discussion as it is significantly less expensive. I drove the A4 next and really liked the experience. I take some confidence in the fact that they have been doing AWD longer than anyone else. I also like they seem to think about what you'd like to be able to see which you're driving without having to jump through hoops. I thought their Nav was more intuitive than the others I saw. The ride was also smooth and fluid but I didn't really get to open it up due to the traffic and the flooding around me. I am probably going to retry the test drive at another dealership to get a different experience. My concerns were that I have no idea whether you can negotiate a price on these (it was listed as $42ish for the model I'd want), the back seat looked really small and I was surprised at how wide the car was. For the ""small"" car of the group they seem to be wide. I don't want to end up driving my wife's Altima (which looks puffy) instead of a small luxury car....I definitely would put them at the top of my choice so far though, unfortunately if it was that clear cut I wouldn't be asking for input from you fine folks. "
"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," I drove the 328i next which was always at the top of my list. I figure it can't be on the top of this segment every year for no reason right? I'll start by saying I wasn't happy that it gets worse gas mileage than the others I'd tried up to this point. What I mean by that is to get the same gas mileage i have to avoid the AWD which is supposed to make the BMW great. I figured that they would try to make that equal. I also was a little taken aback by the pompousness of the salespeople who I dealt with. They were basically like, the other people's cars could never do this, and they proceeded to drive around a racetrack they had built to show the car's handling. I'm pretty sure that the A4 and MB (just to start) could do that type of driving if I wanted it to...I mean they're both cut from a similar cloth. Otherwise I did like the car. I thought the navigation system looked like it wasn't made to be in the car. It did feel much more like a sports car than the others I had driven. Since I drove it on a ""test track"" I will be going to a different dealer so that I can drive it on a road with potholes and other bumps to see how it feels. The car has significantly more options and colors than the others in this category which I appreciate because i don't want a white/red/grey/black car. I want a nice color blue and unfortunately the other dealers have never seemed to want to make more than standard dark blue. Its kind of ridiculous. Also assuming that all else is equal I do think the ""extended warranty"" offered by BMW is huge. I would love to not have to pay $50+ for every oil change. Even if i am paying that a bit upfront...The last car I drove, which I may drive again, is the C300. I didn't have this on my list at all as I had heard terrible things about MB over the last few years in regards to reliability and design. I wanted to try the car however as most who I know who've tried it mentioned that it was much better at ""hiding"" the bumps in the road which is a big deal in North jersey. As I mentioned in my first post if I wanted to feel every bump in the road I would just buy another Toyota. In the smaller car segment you feel everything in most cars (which I hate) even though I will only drive a small car. I thought the car was very nice. As nice as the Audi in my experience and I thought there was a very ""expensive"" feel to the drive. I didn't significantly notice the ""cloud"" feeling while driving but i think that had to do with expectations versus results. They are adding a blue color in 12 that I want to see because that may put this ahead. Again though the cost may be prohibitive....we'll see.I'd really love anyone's input into what decisions you made and why on these models. I will probably be making a decision over the next month or so. "
"2233","September 2011"," I've driven all the cars you are considering except the MB. All are nice cars but I would rate them G37 and BMW 328 (a tie for first) and then the A4.The Infinitis seem to be the most reliable. All 3 handle well. I don't like the BMWs interior since it seems dated. The Audi and G have a cleaner looking interior. I don't care for the run flat tires on the BMW but some like them. The deals are better on the Infinitis now unless you currently own a BMW or Audi and qualify for a loyalty incentive. Love the size and exteriors of all 3.I own 2 G35s now and the back seats do not fold down which is a negative. The BMW does not fold down unless you pay for a $400 option for the folding seat.That is why I am probably buying an Infiniti EX 35 AWD. The EX is actually 5 inches shorter than a G37 so some describe it as a combination of a crossover and a coupe. It has the reliablity, performance, handling, good looks, and the ability to haul a bit, albeit a small amount but way more than the G37. The ability to fold down the seats in the EX is huge with me.Some reviewers felt that the EX had a smoother ride than the G37.There is also a $2,000 incentive on the EX so it may be the least expensive of the bunch.When you test drive the right car you will hopefully know it as I did. The EX just felt the best although it may not be considered a sedan by some but an argument can be made that it is.Actually my favorite handling car was the BMW 328xi sport wagon (E91) but the interior was very unattractive and really dated. This clearly is not a sedan though but I liked the storage, utility, smallish size and again handling.Good luck with your search. "

"plekto","September 2011"," Your take on the TSX is interesting as the same vehicle is sold in Japan with an ""Accord"" badge on it. It's an evolutionary design if anything and not a real new model. We get the top trim model Accord sent over here and they slap some Acura badges on it. Hence why it's not really satisfying as a real luxury sport sedan. The IS has the same problem in that it shows its Corolla DNA all too well.The G37 as well can't hide the fact that it's a pimped-out 370Z.I'd also recommend taking a serious look at the CTS. It's one of two vehicles that GM makes that are world-class. The rest? Yes, it's typical bean-counting GM idiocy and blandness. I'd not recommend anything else they build. (the other vehicle is sold in Australia, unfortunately).Pros: Cost to repair is less than the European models. About the same as the imports, which have crept up in price without most people noticing.Ride is designed with U.S. drivers and roads in mind.(note - avoid the performance model as the tires are lower profile than necessary) It's a bit stiff as expected, but handles long road trips without any faults.The interior is very nice. Who knew GM could actually make an interior that didn't suck? The NAV system is actually very good. Comparing the NAV system in the Mercedes to the CTS is like comparing a TV dinner to real food. The CTS? It just works.Headroom and overall space is good. One thing about it that's great is that it's actually the same wheelbase size as a E class or 5 series, but the sheet metal is artfully done in such a way that it hides its size and looks a bit smaller. And as a bonus, it doesn't look like everyone else's jellybean. Honestly, you can't tell a G37 from a Hyundai from a Mazda from two blocks away. "
"wireless","September 2011"," I thought about the CTS as well but it gets bad reviews on a couple of items: ""Poor rear visibility; awkward driving position."" Two items that are must haves for me and I would think most people. I doubt I'll ever sacrifice rear-visibility for style, GM gets similar dings on the Camaro. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," ray....good point about the CTS. The one I drove (coupe) probably had the nicest interior this side of a Maserati. Cadillac did an excellent job. Didn't care much for the seats, but in and out, the coupe is a stunning looking vehicle. If I hadn't had a previously poor experience with a Cadillac (STS) I might have considered one more seriously.That CTS drives well, too.Having been through this test several months ago, I'm probably going to go against the grain. I drove both a C300 and a C350. Really, nothing special on either.....especially for the price. I'd much prefer an A4, or an Acura TL SH AWD, or a BMW over the Benz. E class wasn't bad. But, dang......$60K for a little more sheet metal? No thanks! The C class was overpriced enough, the E class even more. They aren't bad cars.....just nothing I'd consider.If you want driver's cars, probably stick to the BMW, Audi, Acura, even the Infiniti.All the above cars are built well with great materials.However, if I were serious about a Benz, I'd probably look at the CTS, as it more closely resembles driving a Benz, but with a lot more style.

"plekto","September 2011"," First - Cadillac did sell a BTS in Europe which was 3 series sized and priced, but it sold only a few hundred of them. The CTS is actually their middle model in the lineup if you look at their entire global Cadillac lineup. They just wisely decided to not sell the smaller one in the U.S. It's is more akin the an E or 5 series. Which isn't too surprising, really. It's bigger, it's heavier, and it's not really designed to be a 3 series competitor.As for reliability, my parents have owned a standard model with the smaller 3.0L engine in it and it's been flawless. Not a single problem at all in the first year that they've owned it.And even if something does go wrong, it's a lot less than a Mercedes to fix.Lastly, yes, I know the Japanese companies play around with names and so on, but the comments are all too true. The G37 does share enough DNA with the Z that it's just not possible to hide the fact that it's a modified Nissan Z. And The IS, while it's not *exactly* based upon a Corolla, it's small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it.

"plekto","September 2011"," Some Cadillacs *are* unfortunately glorified Buicks. Charging the sheet metal on the exterior or playing with the doors and so on doesn't change a thing for most of these cars. They toned down the suspension on the G37 and added some leather, but it's still a pretty plastic interior and drives more akin to a muscle car than a real sports sedan. It's great in a straight line, but that's about it, really.Is it entry-level luxury? I'd say not. It fails that half of the equation, because almost every car these days can be had with leather and NAV, and so you have to look further and be a bit more discerning in what exactly ""luxury"" means aside from leather and a high price tag.

I guess the BMW is a muscle car too, lol. If the G37 is not an entry level luxury sedan than the CTS is most certainly not.

The 1 series is at least pretty close to the E36, which is barely passable. A bit heavy, but workable with some weight reduction tricks and some aftermarket tweaks. I put the specs for the older E30, though, because it's really the benchmark for this class. Which every manufacturer seems to have simply ignored in the race to have more and more power. (same as the ""Big 3"" did in the 70s with Muscle cars).Heavier than a Buick.

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," I wonder why you test drove the Acura TSX but not the Acura TL. I am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the TL probably compares ""better"" to an Audi A4, BMW 3, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti G (etc, etc). After having owned 29 Audis, I sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an Acura TL ""advance"" AWD, an Audi A4 Prestige with sport package, an Infiniti (also with several packages including Sport AWD), and a Volvo S60 T6 with several packages to make it comparable to the Audi/Acura Prestige/Advance packages. I was planning to make my decision based on the best deal I could get on any one of these.Although I did look at a TSX, it seemed a step down from the others I mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an Audi A3 or perhaps an Infiniti G25 or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational cars.A point is that, to me, all of the cars in this class were contenders and I drove all of them (excluding the MB, why I can't recall). Three of the cars stood out as high performers (four, actually, but I'll get to that in a moment): the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, the Audi A4 Prestige with Sport package and 8-spd Tiptronic and the Volvo S60 T6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the Audi and the Acura. The fourth car that didn't make it to the finals was the G37X S -- a car I wanted to want, since I am so impressed with my wife's 2011 FX35/Premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).The G didn't make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest. I later figured out why -- it is less than 70"" wide, and it just seems cramped from behind the wheel. The TL, for instance is 74"" wide and has a 63.8"" track compared to the G's 60.2"" track. I made my decision, after 29 Audis in a row, based on price per month. I was ready to take (and I wanted) an Audi A4 first, the TL second and the Volvo third. I test drove the heck out of the cars (and I currently have a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige Sport) and determined that the Audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.) Yet, both the Acura and the Volvo were so much more powerful and actually seemed larger than the Audi, which was a plus since I often have my in-laws in the back seat.When all was said and done, the Audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the Acura and the Volvo was about the same as the Audi but for 36 months to the Audi's 42.I took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the Advance package it is, MSRP wise, about the same as the Audi, but has a 305HP engine, although it lacks the Audis 8 speed transmission.Having tested and previously having owned an Audi S4, I came away thinking the Acura TL SH-AWD (what a mouthful) was ""somewhat closer"" to an S4 than it is to an A4, and for $11,500 less with similar content.Sorry for the long story, but I think you should have at least tested the TL, it is a completely different car than the TSX, and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an A4 or G37, etc. The TL, on the other hand at $47,000 with ""the works"" is about the same price and class as the A4 and G37 (and the CTS for that matter.) In any case, in the entry level sport luxury class or whatever this is, most of these cars are winners. :surprise: "
"carnaught","September 2011"," Something else that needs to be considered with the TL are its controversial looks which most do not like and the fact that, at least with my, and many others experience, they develop numerous squeaks and rattles and the interior seats show wear prematurely. Maybe this latest TL iteration is improved with regard to those issues, however. "

Also, at this point, the retained value of the TL is among the highest of any vehicle -- hence its terrific lease programs. I got mine which listed for $47+K with one accessory, back up sensors, for $499 per month for 36 months plus tax.If money were no object, I would get an Audi S4 Prestige with the Sport Diff (torque vectoring).

This is also identical to what was happening in the 70s. Bigger and bigger and oh my word that's a huge car all of a sudden...The 1 series is kind of like a E26 V 2.0 in its weight and size. It's what I would consider a sports sedan, if a bit on the heavy side. But what we have now as the current crop of cars are really big bloated grocery hauling machines that just are called ""sporty"" because they are the smallest whales in the pod and happen to have shiny rims and big wheels attached.That said, the TSX simply doesn't belong as it's just a plain vanilla ""Accord"" to the rest of the world.

Add in all the safety crash protection in the frames, larger brakes, airbags, sunroofs, power everything and it makes for more size and weight in cars. Some may not hear it but weight isn't the only thing that matters in a cars drivablilty. "

"plekto","September 2011"," And then you test drove the C class or a BMW. Huge difference. Quiet, refined, and what you want in terms of proper luxury. The main reason Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in Japan, they don't really exist. There is Honda. Period. There is Nissan. End of choices. Toyota just recently stsrted selling Lexus over there, but for almost two decades, it was simply another model of Toyota.Mercedes, they make luxury cars and that's it aside from a few military vehicles and their commercial truck line. It's not a standard vehicle that's been tweaked and had a lot of bling added. It's the real deal. BMW is the same. And Audi, though they are a lot like VW in some ways, has always been its own company and own engineering. A lot like say, Cadillac - there has been some overlap from time to time with the lower end models, but it's always been its own company/line. Acura does nothing for me. In fact, Volvo makes better cars these days. (very nice, in fact, and off of most people's radar here) Infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but it's also huge and basically like a big Lexus in how it drives.

I do agree with your comments about Lexus though being a ""safe vanilla choice"". Mercedes Benz is another ""safe vanilla choice"" and neither Lexus nor MB has ever done anything to knock my socks off. They both are devoid of soul and fun.But Infiniti is no way a safe vanilla choice by any stretch of the imagination. That just goes to show you really need to test drive the vehicles you put down. It is quite sad that you limit yourself to the overpriced, poorer reliability of BMW and MB as your only options as true luxury vehicles. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I agree with you 100% fedlawman. Even though my 2010 TSX is equipped with an automatic, it is the best automatic I've ever driven. It holds shifts in M(anual) mode until I (the driver) flicks the paddle on the right for it to upshift. Even in S(port) mode, as long as my foot is planted, the revs will keep climbing to the redline before the transmission upshifts.I've heard the TSX with a 6-speed stick is an absolute blast to drive. We've already got one car in our fleet that my wife cannot drive (my 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH). When we bought the Acura, it was supposed to be her car (replacing our dearly loved 2007 BMW X3). Since we found out child #3 is on her way, we bought my wife a Pilot & I inherited the TSX.Is my TSX perfect? No. Like our resident 1st generation TSX owner says ""the wrong wheels are driving the car."".

It is definitely a car you have to drive to appreciate. I'm not saying the TL isn't more of a driver's car with it's 305 hp V6 & SH AWD. It's price of admission is significantly higher than the TSX. It also didn't meet the gas mileage requirements of the cash 4 clunkers program.For the record, I dig ""the beak."" "

"plekto","September 2011"," You do realize that vehicles from the 5-Series below and E-Class below are not even considered luxury over in Europe?Absolutely. What's amazing is that we consider an Accord with a fancy badge on it and some upgraded suspension parts to be luxury over here. Now, to be fair, a lot of that is because they are a bit jaded over there, but you'd figure that the minimum standard would at least be something like a 5 series or similar in the U.S. Not re-badged Accords and Buicks and the like.Perhaps we've been driving crap for so long over here that we now consider above average to be fantastic. The TSX might be great to a lot of people, but they are simply unaware. To consider it a ""luxury sport sedan"", well it fails on both accounts. Front wheel drive, underpowered for its weight unless you get the V6, dead steering feel, and, well, the list goes on and on. If you consider it to be awesome luxury, well, more power to you. As for trying to find a ""luxury sport sedan"", well, my take on it is that nobody makes one any more. They now all make large luxury cars with a sporty suspension and needlessly large tires to compensate.Here's a challenge:Find me a car with 2 or 4 doors. If 2 doors, it must have a usable back seat. No, the 911 does not qualify, obviously.It must be rear wheel drive.It must be under 3000lbs.It must be sporty. Not rims and some spoiler but really upgraded.And that's before we add the luxury requirement to the mix. Can anyone here find one? Really. Maybe I forgot some vehicle or something? Everything I find is front wheel drive or hundreds of pounds heavier. Even raising the weight to 3200lbs adds a mere handful of choices in the first category.

"smarty666","September 2011"," Of course its a challenge, because the criteria you place on a sports sedan is absurd. I never said the TSX is a sport sedan but the G37 and 3-Series most certainly are. You will find few people who will argue otherwise. I didn't realize that the 16inch and 17inch wheels offered OEM are needlessly large tires? I suppose some 14 inch ones would be better :P The problem is, you and many others place too much emphasis on what the rest of the world is doing in the car market. Who cares what is and what is not offered in Japan, or Germany, China, Korea, etc. Who cares that Lexus, or Infiniti, and Acura are not everywhere around the globe. What matters is they are here and have been for some time now. All that matters is what we are offered here and what we get to choose from. In my life, I have had plenty of mainstream division cars and luxury division vehicles, trust me, there is a big difference between the two. Unfortunately, people such as yourself, go in at bat with the mindset that they are just rebadged junk and not worth the money, but there is more than just the name and price. It is nicer materials, better put together body, longer warranty, better dealership experience, etc and some other perks you get at the luxury companies than the mainstream.

But we get the jumbo economy sized pigs in the U.S.3600lbs for a 3 series is criminal.When a previous generation Altima came in at 3000lbs, and it wasn't a tiny car, something's gone horribly wrong. It's not unreasonable to expect lightweight and sporty. The Maxda RX8 is (now was - hope the replacement isn't 3500lbs and FWD) 3000lbs. It gets it right. I actually did find a one car that fit my list. At least for a sport sedan. (yes, it has 4 doors, though their choice of having the rear two open backwards was questionable) Why is a G37 500 lbs heavier than a RX8? Surely the engineers aren't ITT Tech drop-outs. Also, from a handling perspective, larger tires will create more lateral grip so that we get better testing scores, but if the car is lighter, it can do just as well with even 15 inch tires. Compare an E30 to today's nonsense. Much smaller suspension parts, smaller tires, smaller brake calipers, and yet it runs much better than the current model in actual driving because you don't have to manhandle the thing and hear the tires howling to get good speed down a twisty road.

"markcincinnati","September 2011","  While not the universal answer to the many complaints about the weight of these cars we go on about, I suspect there is some justification for the piling on of pounds these machines have endured over the years.Among the reasons are the addition of more and more safety devices, electronic nannies (most of which I love), increased sound deadening, more content (which may be luxury content, increased unsprung weight (from ever larger and heavier wheels and tires, etc.)), larger engines, more gears in the transmission (although sometimes there are weight savings with some of the new transmissions. . .sometimes), widespread adoption or availability of AWD, more plush (and heavier) interiors, etc. Simultaneously, I assume the mfgr's are attempting to shave every ounce or pound they can with the use of lighter materials where ever possible and cost effective.As Pogo says ""we have met the enemy and he is us."" We want more luxury features, we want more powerful engines, we want the sportiness. and stickiness of AWD, we want our cars to be quieter and we want the big shiny wheels -- 18-inchers are for sissies, we need 19's, 20's or even bigger (and heavier) ones. We want tires that have side-walls that are super-stiff (hence heavier tires) and we want every possible power amenity: power seat massagers and ventilated seats even. Hell I don't want these things, I NEED them! Doesn't everybody?I suppose ABS and ESP and Brake Assist weigh something -- but gawd, why have a car without that stuff (and I certainly want the OTHER drivers to have these features, since THEY --- not me -- have become such dreadful drivers over the years.)So we're ""stuck"" with ever heavier cars -- because we WANT them, are required by law to have them and are, apparently, willing to pay for them.Frankly, virtually any of the following: Acura TL Advance, Audi A4 Prestige/Sport (or S-Line), BMW 335i xdrive, Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Performance/Luxury, Infiniti G37X/S or Volvo S60 T6 would be welcome in my garage -- the fact that after 29 Audis in a row I bought a TL was simply that the damn thing came in nearly $200 less per month than the car I wanted, a 2011 Audi A4 Prestige/Sport. That and the 19"" wheels and tires and a very sweet and smooth 305HP engine. Oh yea, and an even better sound system than the B&O system found in the Audi (and THAT is saying something.)I may find, as some suggest here, that the Acura will ultimately prove to be unexciting, uninspiring and prone to rattles and premature leather wear (on the seats). Residual values suggest otherwise, but I don't even have 1,000 miles on the Acura yet, so I am not a reliable or experienced witness.Anyway, kwitcherbitchin', the cars are heavy, heavier, heaviest mostly because we want them that way (or at least most of us do.) :surprise: "

"shipo","September 2011"," Like it or don't, if you want a car with in excess of 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, you'll also need to buy a car with a heavier engine and drive-train. Throw just the engine from the 335i into a 328i (a process which will bump the weight in and of itself), and just watch what happens to the rest of the drive-train. Not pretty.As has been stated here before, between the regulated in safety features and the market demand for larger and more powerful cars, it is physically impossible to build a relatively inexpensive sedan with the size, safety and performance of a 335i for anywhere near 3,200 pounds.

"flightnurse","September 2011"," The main reason why the RX-8 is out of production was the engine was not effient enough, it past emissions with no problem, but it loved Oil, a quart in every 4K miles. Also I would put a 328 again the RX-8, I would place the 128 again it or 135. "
"shipo","September 2011"," Per a press release I read from Mazda last year, their biggest challenge (and subsequent reason for cancelling the RX-8) with the (then) current generation of rotary engines was meeting upcoming emissions standards; especially so in Europe.In this case I'm only the messenger. "
"m6user","September 2011"," I thought this discussion was about RWD sedansI don't see RWD in the discussion title. If you mean that only RWD can be performance cars than that rules out the TL and the A4 unless you get the AWD. But then it's not RWD is it. Also eliminates the TSX which many on here don't think qualifies but I think it fits in as an ENTRY level luxury performance sedan. You're right about the Mazda or Nissan. They are not premium brands but have some nice offerings. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," mark...'gratz on the new TL. They are mighty fine cars. Plus, the SH AWD version you have is much closer to an Audi S4 that Audi cares to admit.Looking back, Acura and BMWs are probably my two favorite brands....I've owned 3 TLs and 3-3 Series, which is more than any other brand/model.Like you, I've driven Lexus, Infinitis, MBs, Caddy. The comparable Acura and BMW always wins out over them.Where did you buy yours.....Superior or Columbia? "
"shipo","September 2011"," Maybe I'm confusing threads, but if I recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy cars have gotten included a reference to RWD Sedans. While I'm personally biased toward RWD vehicles, I don't use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ELLPS segment. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," Thanks for the congrats -- here is the Buying Story.I found a website called CARWOO.COM -- which, for a one time fee, allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity. Unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing, CARWOO takes money ONLY from the buyer, not from the seller (unless, of course they are lying.) I paid $148 which allowed me to send queries to EVERY Audi, Acura, Infiniti and Volovo dealer in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. I limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from Cincinnati.CarWoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.You then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the CarWoo email machine to start sending you links to your CarWoo account with offers from dealers.To make a long story a bit shorter, Volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a $1,000 off MSRP discount. Bzzz! Thanks for playing, maybe next time.Infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes.Audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any A4 would have to be ordered. One of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000 A4 for pity's sake).Acura, locally, came in AT BEST, with a 6.5% discount off MSRP (Columbia). A Columbus Ohio dealer -- Lindsay Acura -- came in at 13% off MSRP for a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance with backup sensors (which are about a $715 accessory.) Here's the funny thing, they sourced the car from Columbia -- I have the window sticker! Whatsupwiththat?!?The car was $499 per month + tax.I had driven ALL of the cars (not a Lexus or MB of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the A4 (what's not to like I still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the M37X and the TL SH-AWD (Advance model). Likewise I thought the Volvo S60 T6 was GREAT FUN! I also had a chance to drive a Premium+ Audi S4 (without the sport diff -- aka no torque vectoring.) Now THAT car was the most fun of all (but in Premium+ mode had much less ""content"" than the other cars I had tested, plus is was mo' money, big time.)Truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, I drove the Audi, the Cadillac and the Acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time, speeds, tunes on the sound system, etc, etc, in one day's worth of test drives.I am hoping not to receive a bunch of ""ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND"" posts, but I will venture to say this -- the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance is very close in performance and overall ""character"" to an Audi S4 -- and although very nice and perhaps ""dressier,"" the Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 with the 19"" wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch.Now the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance is no Audi S4, I am not saying it is, the S4 would be the winner, but contented to match the Acura was just shy of $12,000 more and I could not muster the one that I drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners THAT much quicker than I could the Acura (which may have had an advantage over the Audi at the time since the Acura had torque vectoring and the the Audi did not. Moreover, the Audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the Acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the Audi.So, I says to myself, the Acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you CarWoo.Com.No one else even came close.Remember I was pricing an A4 2.0T Prestige 8-spd Tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close MSRP wise to the Acura. The Cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not focussed on performance as much as the other guys. And, the Cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000 CTS does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. All the other guys do -- and I consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required. How much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50? What were they thinking? And, moreover, Cadillac in the 4-door CTS does not even offer a blind spot warning system -- which came standard on both the Audi and the Acura at the trim levels I spec'd.So, thus far, I am missing the Audi new car smell, I miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but I rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, I miss the Audi needle sweep when I start the Acura up.Then, I get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305HP 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine, watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, I'm at 80MPH in a distance that seems not much longer than my driveway.Loving the cooled seats and the best sound system I have ever heard in any car (including the B&O in Audi which had been my previous fave.)Having said all of this -- I probably still would have gone with the Audi 2.0T Prestige Sport if it had come in at a price to match the Acura.Money talks, as the saying goes. . . :surprise: "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Yes the RX8 is light, Balanced,RWD, & Nimble. Like shipo says, at costs. The engine's torque peaks at a very lofty RPM and my Dad's 2010 Chevy Tahoe gets better gas mileage. Before you quote me EPA sticker numbers, find out what the real world MPG is on an RX8. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," Great deal & a great write up on a fantastic car. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," Mark...cool! As NYC said, great write-up.I'm familiar with both Columbia and Hidy. Funny that Hidy was trying to sell a car that was on Columbia's lot.Interesting about CARWOO, also. Personally, I don't care if dealers know my identity. But, I can see where if you didn't want to be bothered with having them contact you where it might be useful.Anyway, that TL is a very nice ride. You'll like it during the time you have it parked in your driveway.Funny about Audis. When I was looking several months ago, S4s were on my shopping list. The Cincinnati dealer told me they had such limited stock of everything because the factory wasn't shipping them as many cars. That included their volume model the A4. They had one S4, but it wasn't even close to what I was looking for, and it was a demo.The Audi store in Dayton had one, but it was a 2K mi trade-in (wonder how much of a bath that owner took) who wanted the (then new) A7 instead.Beechmont had the best selection with 4 S4s at the time. But, like you, I couldn't see where the price delta was worth it to pay that much more over the similar TL SH AWD.BMW is offering to do a factory performance retrofit on my 335i, which would up both the HP and the torque by about 7%. Understand, I believe that BMW is stretching the truth about how much HP and torque the 335i motor is putting out in factory trim (it's a lot more). The kicker, I can do the facotry performance upgrade at my dealership, complete with normal BMW warranty for $600. I'm debating if I'll want it. My car's already as fast as greased lightening, how much more could I want? But, we're talking 20 extra ponies here. "

"kyfdx","September 2011"," $600 for 20 horsepower? That's a cheap upgrade.... "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," Mark....sorry about that. Seems I've talked to, or visited every Acura and BMW dealer within a 100 mile radius of Cincinnati in the last couple of years. They start to run together.I'm familiar with Lindsay, too. While, I've not visited the store, I had dealt with one of the sales people there, who wasn't very good. I was looking for a particular color combo. He said he had it. When I asked him for the VIN#, he strung me along, wanting me to come to the store to ""talk about the car"". I wanted to make sure they had the color combo before making a 90 minute drive. I told him all it would take for me to drive up to visit him was the VIN so I could confirm he had what I wanted. He couldn't/wouldn't He wouldn't assure me of that.Again, congrats on the car. It's a very nice one that you're going to enjoy a lot.kyfdx.....here's the blurb on Edmunds (which my dealer confirms they can do).....http://www.insideline.com/bmw/1-series/bmw-offers-performance-power-kit-for-135i- -and-335i.htmlI know the previous 135/335 had the twin turbo (N54), and the new ones have the twin scroll turbo (N55). I've driven both. The N54 had a bit of turbo lag (not much). But, BMW overboosts it at higher RPM (which is why the 335is is rated with more HP and torque than the N55. However, I think both motors are under rated and put out more HP and torque than BMW says they do.That said, I'm trying to decide if I want the extra HP/torque. That would essentially make my 335i coupe with the same engine performance as the 335is, which is mighty good.But, mine is really good to begin with. I'm debating but probably will do it when I can schedule some time at the dealership to get it done. Who doesn't like more HP and torque? :shades: How's your new Z4, BTW? Did you ever post pics? "
"plekto","September 2011"," Maybe I'm confusing threads, but if I recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy cars have gotten included a reference to RWD Sedans. While I'm personally biased toward RWD vehicles, I don't use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ELLPS segment. I didn't exclude FWD or AWD cars, it's just that BMW's earlier models set the standard for the class, which led to the best example, the E30. (also Volvo did make a 240 turbo which was nearly identical at the time). That both were RWD was just because that's how they liked to make cars.But as far as weight, 3500+ lbs isn't sporty. Not when you add in fuel, fluids, a battery, and normal stuff like a spare tire, which aren't part of the ""dry weight"" listed. That adds another 200-300 lbs or so, conservatively. Then add in a typical driver, and you can be at or near 4000lbs rolling down the road. Physics dictate that you cannot get a 2 ton anything to turn on a dime and actually be nimble.Now, compared by decades of sofa on wheels, yes, they could be described as ""sporty."" But they're a far, far cry from their original roots.Oh, I thought of another possible small sport sedan to add to the under 3000lbs list - the Mini Cooper S. In fact, this is a perfect example, because on paper the turning radius is actually worse than a 128i. (vs 35.1 vs 36.2 ft) But drive one and it's a huge difference in how they actually move and handle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF4YWKWjLIkHere is the 128i vs the Cooper. Of note is the huge difference in slalom speeds. Weight is a huge problem that even better tires and RWD can't completely mitigate. In something like a TSX, well, the slalom speed for a TSX is 64.6 mph (both Edmunds, same exact testing methods) The original E36 M3? Edmunds managed to get one to go 75mph through their slalom. Just a whole other planet compared to today's cars. "

"rayainsw","September 2011"," [ BMW Euro Delivery ]Executive summary:Friday, 16 Sept. &#150; Picked up at the Munich airport and chauffeured to the Welt. Took delivery of the new BMW. Drove out of the city - south and east, then west into Austria. Stayed overnight in Krimml.Saturday, 17 Sept. &#150; Hiked around Krimml Falls and then crossed the Gerlos Pass \ Alpine Road and headed toward Innsbruck. Turned south and stayed the night in Verona, Italy.Sunday, 18 Sept. &#150; Drove south to a B&B located in a tiny village [ Pitelli ] near La Spezia.Monday & Tuesday, 19 & 20 Sept. &#150; Toured Cinque Terre villages.Wednesday, 21 Sept. &#150; Toured a couple of other local tiny villages, right on the La Spezia area coast = S. Terenzo and Lerici.Thursday, 22 Sept. &#150; Drove north to Switzerland. Stayed overnight in San Bernardino.Friday, 23 Sept. &#150; Drove north then east to Memmingen, Germany. Toured the old city in the afternoon.Saturday, 24 Sept. &#150; Briefly toured other areas close to the hotel in the morning and enjoyed the local farmers&#146; market. Drove to Munich Airport & flew back to the US.Overall comments: This was a terrific experience for my daughter and me. We were very fortunate, weather-wise. We had some rain overnight the first night, but it cleared by mid-morning. It rained cats & dogs & buckets during the latter part of the drive to the La Spezia area, and was quite windy much of the overnight &#150; but it cleared by morning, and that resulted in more surf than one would expect on the Mediterranean coast, while we toured the Cinque Terre villages. The scenery and the weather those days and driving while in Austria and Switzerland were almost literally breathtaking.Oh, and the BMW 335iS Coupe [ Le Mans Blue, Gray, DCT ] ran flawlessly the whole time &#150; just over 1,000 miles. Counting the days now until [re-]delivery.I plan to post details in the CCBA forum about several of the days, with links to photographs on photobucket &#150; but that may take another few days.Cheers,- RayHappy BMW driver . . .

Same goes for most models.Ray...congrats on the new car. Would also love to hear about the delivery. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," I am pretty well convinced that my 2012 TL will outperform my 2009 A4 2.0T, too. The Audi, which has Audi Drive Select, can be put into ""dynamic"" mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds. It has 19"" wheels with Ultra High Performance Yoko S.Advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).It has rear wheel drive biased quattro and last but not least has 211HP and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic ""tiptronic"" transmission.It, the Audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.The TL isn't quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1"" shorter wheelbase. It is nose heavier than the Audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not Ultra High Performance) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased AWD, but also includes torque vectoring. It feels a bit softer than the A4, it is quieter and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305HP and 274 lb feet of torque, and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (slightly) taught, tight curve carver.The Audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds, or maybe higher than the Acura, even without torque vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305HP allows the Acura to always show the Audi its tail lights. My Audi, all in, was $49K (MSRP) The Acura, just south of $48K -- at these prices power rules. And, overall the Acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated seats (that the Audi lacks).Said it before, irrational as it might be, if the Audi were the same lease price per month as the Acura (that is about $200 less), I would have gone with another Audi -- just for that special something that only a German car seems to offer.Irrational.Couldn't see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. I am overall quite pleased with the Acura and if they continue to improve and move forward AND keep their value prop, well, I could become a TRUE BELIEVER. You know, though, any of these cars are pretty damn nice. :surprise: "

"nyccarguy","September 2011"," graphicguy & markincincinati - I think the 2 major things you'll both notice that are different between your current & former TL SH AWD & current BMW & Audi are:Steering. Having never driven a TL SH AWD, just my 2010 TSX, I can tell you the electric power steering stinks. Road feel is non-existant at low speeds. At higher speeds it is really nice and tight though. Brakes. There is a reason that my TSX is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment. Acura honda had to cut corners somewhere. The brakes on my TSX are terrible. Nothing at all like BMW's RIGHT NOW brakes with their incredible pedal firmness & physics defying stopping ability.Obviously power is different too. Mark's Acura is definitely faster than his former A4, while graphicguy's 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90% of the normal cars on the road "
"tlong","September 2011"," I had a 1998 A4 (6 cyl) and have an '05 TL. Differences between the two:- TL has more electronic goodies (but 7 year newer car)- TL poorer handler, wallows in turns- TL's climate control much quieter- Audi interior clearly nicer- Audi control feel and driving feel clearly better- Audi inspired much more passion- Audi extremely expensive to maintain, the few things that broke were a LOT- Acura has been outstandingly reliable and cheap to maintain "
"sweendogy","September 2011"," Breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura tsx less expensive. 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car, lets not forget the accord platform. Its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan, as 90% of them are sold with automatics. (same thing with the TL, nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in sh-awd form) Closest to the germans is Infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) . Cars from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with MPG mandates - I know BMW will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, Acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with MB for its next line of engines, should be interesting.

"nyccarguy","September 2011"," I might be mistaken, but off the top of my head the only other Honda Product that uses the exact same motor (2.4L - 201 hp - 176 lb/ft torque) is the Civic Si.I'll agree with you that under extreme circumstances, my TSX shows it's Accord Platform roots. We have some seriously twisty back roads here in southwestern Connecticut. There's one particular road where the sign shows ""S"" curves for 1 mile with a 15 mph suggested speed limit. My TSX shows the flaws in it's chassis.Like many here have said, price aside, I'd choose a BMW.Every single car in this segment shines in it's own way.

"graphicguy","September 2011","  nyc.....interesting compare and contrast. My BMW does indeed drive better than my TL SH AWD. That said, the TL was no slouch. Neither were the TSX and RSX I had as loaners. Acura captures a good amount of the BMW feel.Also, little things I've noticed....the HVAC in my TL was better in getting to, and holding temps, hot or cold, with no ""fried feet"" or ""frozen nose"" affect.My 335i is fast....very fast....and will let me corner at any speed that my nerves will allow.Seats were better in the TL. If you care, the stereo in the TL was a big step up vs the one in my 3 (which is actually the upgraded Harmon Kardon stereo). I've driven a lot of premium cars. The stereo in the TL tech package surpasses all of them, by a pretty fair margin.Transmission (autos)....hands down better in the 3....which has one of the best I've ever experienced.Build quality, the BMW gets the nod. As good as Acura is (and Acura is very, very good), BMW is better with gaps, paint, etc. Reliability, hard to say, this is my 3rd BMW and I never had any issues with any of them. But, I've had 3 Acuras, too. Never had any issues with any of them, either.I know me, though. 3 years down the road, I'll be looking for something else.However, given what I'm hearing that 4 cyl (even with turbos) will be the calling card for BMW, I'd probably look elsewhere. I'm fearful powerful 6es, with turbos, gobs of torque everywhere, may not be in BMW's radar in a few years. Hope that's not the case, though.The motor in my 335i is one of the sweetest I've ever driven, as was the 3.7L in the TL. "

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," . . .I can tell you that the Acura is not an Audi (DOH!) but as mine is equipped (2012 TL SH-AWD Advance Package), it is a capable car. Believable as an EL Luxury Performance Sedan -- totally believable. It would be more believeable if Acura had chosen the best available Ultra High Performance A/S shoes instead of the ""OK"" Goodyear RS-A's. My 2009 Audi A4 was special ordered with the sport package, which at the time included 19"" 35 series Max Performance Dunlops, Sport Seats and 3 Spoke Sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a lowered and stiffened suspension. I also configured mine with a $3,000 option called Audi Drive Select which would actually further stiffen the ride via firming the shocks when you pressed Dynamic mode.I was given, many times, 2009, 2010 and 2011 A4 Premium Plus versions as loaners -- none of them had sport packages or Audi Drive Select.A new A4, even in Prestige dress (but without the sport package option or SLine and Audi Drive Select), feels softer and demonstrates greater body roll than my new TL. A new A4 minus the sport package lacks the bolstered seats (which the TL has) and any attempt to throw the car into curves causes your butt to slip slide away and the A4 in standard suspension trim demonstrates a fair amount of body roll. Meanwhile the TL grips you as you accelerate hard whilst in a corner and the torque vectoring makes the car damn near PIVOT through the corner. The TL is not an A4 and it is, duh, also not an S4. However when talking about these cars' abilities in the twisties, the TL behaves more like an A4 with the SLine or Sport Package and pulls hard enough to ""allow you to imagine"" IMAGINE you are feeling the urge that accompanies pressing the accelerator of an S4 way south. In other words, the TL is caught somewhere between an A4 2.0T Prestige with the Sport Package and Audi Drive Select and an S4 Prestige with the sport differential.Given a magic wand, I would have the S4 Prestige with ADS+Sport Diff -- in a hearbeat.But, without magic, the $12,000 difference (that the S4 commands) tends to change one's mind.This time, even the A4 2.0T Prestige w/Sport priced me out of the Audi market -- especially AFTER I had driven the TL Advance back to back with a 2011 A4 (which, admittedly did NOT have the sport package.)That it takes -- essentially -- a $50,000+ Audi A4 SLine (mine lacked SLine trim bits) to subjectively feel as performance oriented as the TL Advance, says SOMETHING about Acura -- yet, at this point in my experience (1,000 miles), I'm not exactly sure what that something is.The next gen TL is probably the one to make me a repeat and perhaps long-term believer or make me somehow pony up the coin for another Audi. :surprise: "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Not too sure what people in this forum have been smoking,why are you talking about a S4 and a Acura TL together??? Not even close in comparison... Not too sure even if I would compare the A4 to a TL since the TL is a bigger car with more interior volume. What I find interesting is, it appears Audi has dropped the sport package from the A4 line up, not too sure if that was a smart move for them. "
"nyccarguy","September 2011"," markincincinnati & graphicguyFunny how the 3 of us are at opposite ends of the financial spectrum in our lives, yet have similar tastes & tolerances when it comes to cars.The seats in my TSX is one thing that I absolutely LOVE! They are thickly bolstered, firm, & super comfortable. They do a fantastic job keeping my narrow, 150 lb rear end from sliding around during aggressive handling maneuvers.The main thing that fueled the purchase of my TSX was fuel economy. Back in August 2009 I had a 1990 BMW 325i I bought about a year earlier that wouldn't pass NY state inspection & my trusted mechanic told me I should either find a new engine or start paying him to tear the car's Inline 6 apart to find out what was wrong. Cash 4 Clunkers came about and I realized my car qualified for a $3500 rebate. I was also going to need a car in the next year because the lease on our 2007 X3 was going to end & we were in danger of going way over our 45,000 allotted miles. So I wanted a car that drove great, had a roomy back seat (for our 2 child safety seats), & a generously sized trunk (to accommodate our double stroller).I headed straight to an Audi dealer to drive an A4 Avant. I drove a Premium model & thought it was OK, nothing special. I was also frightened at the prospect of owning an Audi for the long haul. I went an drove a Mini Cooper S Clubman which I didn't like. A very awkward car. Lots of blindspots. Lifeless and very disconnected electric power steering. Rubbery shifter. Clutch with a high take up point.I then stopped by an Acura dealer, drove the TSX & said to myself, I really like this car. It drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 Prelude Type SH. It is by no means perfect, but for the price, it rocks. I've got 2 sons (5 & 2 1/2) and a daughter on the way in early December. Cars are expensive (especially the ones I like). Right now I do too much driving (TSX is 2 years old & has over 40K, while Pilot is 4 months old with 7,000 miles) to lease. Leasing is also very expensive. Nor can I afford to buy cash & trade every 2-3 years.I plan to pay off my car loans in 5 years & keep them for at least 10 years (assuming no mechanical catastrophies or god forbid accidents) so we can (re)build our savings towards retirement & our Children's college educations.I've owned exclusively new cars since I got my license at 16 (besides my E30 BMW which was a project car). I love the way BMWs drive so much that if something happens to my Acura, I'd look for a CPO BMW 335 with the N55 in a heartbeat. "
"graphicguy","September 2011"," flightnurse....having test driven a couple of S4s, and having owned a TL SH AWD, I can honestly say that the TL SH AWD is closer to the S4 than Audi would care to admit. Then, there's the big price delta that you have to consider.Mark.....I did indeed find both the A4 (S-line) and S4 ""softer"" than the TL. Not that it's a bad thing....just something I noticed. I really loved the TL SH AWD's seats....some of the best in any car I've owned. They hold you well without cramping. Or, maybe my body type is best made for Acura's sport seats.NYC....IIRC, I think I've got a decade or so in age on you. However, I can see you going down my same car desire path.

I can see you in a TL, or another 3, probably a 5er at some point.....maybe an A6.  "
"fedlawman","September 2011"," NYC,Graphicguy makes some good points. I'm about 10 years ahead of you too...My daughter will get her learner's permit next year and I've already started teaching her how to drive a stick on the weekends (yes, in the M3!). The family dynamic will change permanently when she starts driving.We got the V70 with 3rd row almost 8 years ago and it's been a great family hauler, but when my daughter starts driving, we have some choices to make. Keep the wagon and give it to her?Also, my wife hates the M3 - refuses to drive it except as a last resort. I've started thinking that it's selfish of me to keep it around if I'm the only one who is ever going to drive it. Plus, I have a company car for work, so I only drive the M on weekends or when the sun's out and I get a hankering. It sits in the garage with a trickle charger for most of the winter.So we could keep the Volvo and sell the M3. Let my daughter use the Volvo and get a 911 or 135i or something for me and my wife to share.We could sell the Volvo and the M3 and get a 135i plus a Subaru Outback.We could keep both the Volvo and the M3 and get a 3rd car like a Focus or Cruze for my daughter.Whatever we decide, there are definitely some confusing issues with the changing family dynamic and the car market. Cars are crazy expensive now and like you (and others here), the cars I like are expensive. I would rather not spend $50k on a car, but nothing I have looked at that I like costs less than $40k.I was a new car buyer for many years too, but since I started driving BMW's (my E30 325i was my first one 7 years ago), I can't help thinking there's no value in it. I might try a CPO car next to add some value to the process.Whatever we decide, trading and buying a new car every 3 years is definitely out. I love the fact that the Volvo is paid for and 8 years old, and my wife stills loves the car. The Volvo experience has taught me to buy the most car I can afford and keep it as long as possible. "
"qbrozen","September 2011"," I've pretty much given up on the idea of ever having a new car again, personally. And with as often as I trade, it is probably for the best anyway. "
"flightnurse","September 2011"," Interesting, having driven a couple of S4 myself and a new TL-SH AWD I thought the S4 was by far the better car, the Audi did not lean as much as the TL in corners and I thought the Quattro system was set up for more rear wheel bias then the Acrua. I also thought the Acrua didn't have the low end grunt that the Audi had too. However the looks of the Acrua even after a mid refresh to me is just ugly, its hard to beat the Audis in looks and overall design. "
"markcincinnati","September 2011"," Well, having driven both the S4 and the TL back to back, I can say they are close, if you don't consider the price -- the TL is, IMHO, kind of an Audi AS4, if such an animal actually was available from Audi. Of the Audi S4 and Acura TL, Automobile Magazine said:""If it seems like neither car can pull an advantage here without the other catching up, you've been paying attention. The final equalizer is that, comparably equipped, the Audi costs nearly $11,500 more than the Acura. That kind of money can buy the TL a serious brake upgrade. But the price difference isn't much of a factor here, since we've never actually heard of someone cross-shopping a TL and an S4."" Well, I sorta did. . . ""The Acura is blessed with nearly perfect cornering balance, so its rear differential can easily and dramatically alter the car's handling attitude. It takes a little while to build up trust in the system, but you soon realize that if the car can handle any amount of power in the middle of a turn, it can handle anything the V-6 can throw at it. There's no reason to be scared of the right pedal-the TL begs you to steer it with the throttle. The more power you add, the more neutral the TL's cornering balance and the faster it scrambles through turns. Indeed, the Acura was faster than the Audi through nearly every single corner at BeaveRun.""And furthermore:""It's beside the point to declare a winner or loser when comparing two cars that fall into such different hands in the real world. As that most rabid of enthusiasts, you already have your own prejudices and opinions based on the brands alone, not to mention the countries from which they hail. If we could combine the Audi's good looks, brakes, and tupercharged V-6 with the Acura's steering, handling, and all-wheel-drive system, we'd have discovered luxury car nirvana for the enthusiast driver. In the absence of that elusive hybrid, we walk away from these two wolves in sheepish skins knowing that they are absolute equals in one way: the ability to reassure us that there is, in fact, life after Evo.""Audi:Acceleration0-60 mph: 5.0 sec0-100 mph: 11.5 sec0-110 mph: 13.5 sec0-120 mph: 16.4 sec0-130 mph: 19.7 sec0-140 mph: 23.4 sec0-150 mph: 28.6 sec1/4-mile (sec @ mph): 13.5 @ 11030-70 mph passing: 5.7 secPeak g: 0.69 gAcura:Acceleration 0-60 mph: 5.4 sec 0-100 mph: 13.5 sec 0-110 mph: 16.3 sec 0-120 mph: 20.5 sec 0-130 mph: 24.9 sec 0-140 mph: * 0-150 mph: * 1/4-mile (sec @ mph): 14.1 @ 102 30-70 mph passing: 6.8 sec peak g: 0.66 gkliky here for the full deal: http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- - di_s4/index.html :surprise: "

I would also suspect the Automatic in the Acrua is tuned for quicker shifts then the Accord.

We actually traveled down the road a few blocks in sight of each other and she never once made eye contact with me (and I was practically flailing my arms to get her attention).How is it possible to own a car like that and not notice a comrade-in-arms?!?! "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Short answer, no. At this point, an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + SLine with everything on it except ADS would be a great car. I have ADS, I have, currently both a 2009 A4 Prestige + Sport Pakage (that has ADS) and a 2012 Acura TL Advance.In 2009 but not in 2011 or 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige + Sport or SLine packages, I see less of a need for the $3,000 ADS option due to the fact that the new A4's can be had with an 8-speed tiptronic that comes with Sport Shift and in Sport Package or SLine configuration comes with a lowered sport suspension and sport seats and a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.In other words, TODAY, I would not get an A4 2.0T Prestige + SLine, w/ 8 speed tiptronic and pony up for the ADS.Another reason I would not get this option today: on the A4, Torque Vectoring is not an option (yet). I would pay for the ADS -- on an A4 -- if it came with TV.The S4, at $50,000 is content poor compared with a $47K TL Advance -- but the S4 can be had with TV, under the name Sport Differential. I believe to get TV, however, one needs to buy ADS (on the S4.) The total additional cost to get both ADS+Sport Differential is, as I recall, about $4,500.The S4 I would want would have to be contented to the TL Advance level, and that requires that the S4 be configured NOT as a Premium Plus, but as a Prestige model.If you do all of this to an S4, its MSRP is some $12,000 more than the Acura TL Advance with backup sensors (which is how I have mine configured.)Now, having said all of this, I would rather have the S4 than the TL. Moreover, I would have, at the time, gone with a 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige+SLine without ADS, if the price on a 36 month lease was comparable to the Acura lease (the MSRP's would have been very close to each other so configured.)I should stipulate, that to save a bit, I would be fine with the A4 2.0T Prestige 8-speed tiptronic version with EITHER sport package or SLine, and I know the sport package would have been somewhat less money than SLine, which, for the price difference only includes trim differences not suspension or other performance inducing differences.In any case, my decision was not based on which car I thought was the best -- I went with the one (THIS TIME) that I thought was the BEST VALUE. The TL Advance (with the oddly optional back up sensors @ $725) filled that bill very nicely. My lease on the TL for 36 months was about $150 per month less than the lease on the Audi A4 (Prestige, Sport, etc, etc) for 42 months. At 36 months (apples to apples) the Audi was about $200 per month more than the TL which, although it ain't no Audi, is -- for $200 per month less -- a fine imitation.I've had 29 Audis, since 1977. I have been to the Ingolstadt factory for the how they build 'em tour, 6 times. I have participated in 4 Audi driving schools in Seefeld, Austria (and won one of them -- fastest time through the course.) I, for a number of years, would bleed little interconnected rings when cut. Audi of America sent me to St. Moritz along with 49 other of their ""top 50"" North American customers for the Audi sponsored women's downhill ski cup event.And, I bought one of the first A8's in 1997 (ordered in 1996 and waited 11 months) after Audi sent my dealership a Euro-spec A8 and asked the dealer to loan it to his top customers for 24 hours (undoubtedly a ploy to make the star struck customers order up a new A8 -- which I did.)If the above doesn't qualify me at some level to judge or at least opine about the differences and similarities between an Acura TL Advance and an Audi A4 or S4, I don't know what else does.If I could somehow have been convinced that the Audi was not just incrementally better than the Acura, but substantially better, I would have probably gone with the 2012 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige SLine w/8-speed tip. But after driving two Audis, an A4 and an S4 (2011's and the A4 did not have the sport package -- or SLine, and the S4 was what is simply called Premium Plus and it did NOT have the Sport Differential) then driving a Cadillac CTS/4 with the 19"" wheel sport package (2011) and then the Acura TL Advance, I thought the Acura TL was most like an S4 than it was an A4 or a CTS.I also drove a Volvo S60 T6, an Infiniti G37X/S and an Infiniti M37X Premium+Tech, and an Acurca ZDX Tech. While my '09 A4 was in for service I also had been loaned a 2011 Audi A6 3.0T Premium Plus for a day.Every one of these cars were test driven (and I was video'd by my wife whilst I was driving and giving a running commentary) over the exact same route, the sound systems were tested with the exact same CD's/tunes (Wecome to the Machine, Pink Floyd; How Dare You, 10CC; and, New Frontier, Donald Fagen.)So, I offer up for your consideration: the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, Infiniti and Volvo are all great cars and more alike than different, generally speaking. I wouldn't kick any of them out of bed for eating crackers, and I'd even bring the crackers.You can argue that the Audi is the prettiest (which it is) and the Acura the ugliest (well, hell, that's true too -- even though it is less ugly for 2012), the Cadillac is the ""blingy-est"" (no doubt) and the Infiniti's remain the Japanese BMW's, while the Volvo is the most unexpected -- and delightful to drive -- car of the bunch.The Acura does excel in one area: it has the best damn factory sound system I have ever heard.And, for me, an almost S4 at the price of an Acura TL Advance SH-AWD, is a no-brainer.Drive it like you live -- I'll say it again, these are all very nice cars and all deserve your consideration if you are in the $40 - $50K market.I am, for the next two days driving a new Acura TSX which is the loaner car I was given while my TL has the back up sensors grafted to the rear bumper -- it too is a ""nice car,"" but compared to the others in this Edmunds category, it seems like it is out of place, or perhaps, out of its class.That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.

"tlong","October 2011"," I have owned both Audi and Acura. I tend to agree that for a big price, the Audi is generally a nicer car. But your post is biased based upon irrelevant criteria, IMHO. ""Cars developed for the autobahn"" - All of these car companies are selling worldwide and all need to meet various needs of different countries, whether that be suspension tuning or emissions or left/right side drive. Some Accords in fact are developed in the USA. Germans develop cars in the US, GM develops cars in Europe and China and Australia. It's quite simplistic to assume that parent country of origin = where the car is developed.""comes with a 4cy engine that pumps out 170lbs of torque"" - seems to me that BMW and MB have plenty of 4 cyl engines in Europe (on the autobahn  ) and somehow that's ok. ""The Acura TSX has a narrow price elasticity"" - frankly, I don't see why price elasticity has ANYTHING to do with being a sports sedan, as if tacking on $10K to a price makes a non sports-sedan into one.Ultimately, a sports sedan shouldn't be about cachet, or where it was developed, or whether it is fwd or rwd or 4wd, or whether there is an autobahn or potholes nearby, or whether the platform is shared with economy cars, or whether the price is high or low or elastic or inelastic. What matters is how the car handles, how it feels, how well appointed it is. Given those criteria, Acuras are pretty close to a lot of the European offerings. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," I love the illustrations but they prove little but you did point out that acura/honda did have a good past stable of sports cars but as you know the nsx hasnt been produced since 2005 the s2000 was 09... now given the fact that those 2 cars were rwd and were light weight and were great handlers - something the TL and TSX are not. - Is the A4 a sports sedan->- well thats a great question-- i think in 6speed form with the turbo and awd with the sports package it could be. but I think audi has moved the car into the mainstream to compete vs the TL's and ES's -but in the past with the 2.0 or 1.8 turbo and 6speed for sure it was. the s4/s5 for sure are. the newer car has put on some weight and to get an audi with fwd for me audi is stupid.the tsx is not sporty because of its platform as stated before --its an accord which is a great car but just not sporty. The jetta in standard for is not close to the TSX but in GLI form its more of a sportie sedan then the TSX-(plus its cheaper)- same amt of power.. both have put on weight, but the GLI would be a sportier option given the fact they offer a quick DSG transmission. Same one thats in the GTI. The Jetta R will offer the VR6 in 2012 and get to 60 in 5.5 seconds or about 2.2 seconds quicker then the manual tsx (which only 10% of buyers would get).funny you bring this up -- i leased a acura GS-R and in 2004 had to return it and i considered the TSX, which i liked in manual form ... but I drove the VR6 jetta gli and saved 4k.edmunds tests the gli vs the tsx...http://www.insideline.com/volkswagen/jetta/2006/2005-acura-tsx-vs-2006-volkswage- n-jetta-gli-comparison-test.htmlheres my favorite line ""As much as we liked the refinement of the Acura, the GLI's performance makes it the better sport sedan""good read, eh - i like your passion but again i think we should move this car off the board..i love the track pixs but stay out of the left lane.

Ultimately, while i respect your opinion, its about what the experts recommend and what people buy as being a big decider on what a successful car-- and its a fact that acura has lost share to both bmw, audi and infiniti -- im glad you think that acura handles like the germans but the fact of the matter is the critics and car buyers dont care about the current line.

"fedlawman","October 2011"," You and I fundamentally think differently about cars.In my opinion, a sports car is a sports car based on its DNA, not it's horsepower or amount of traction or it's pedigree.I don't believe that the base A4 (a regular car) magically becomes a sports car because you increase the horsepower or add traction. I don't agree that the ""regular"" Jetta is a family car and the GLI is a sport sedan.Does the Mini require a supercharger to be considered a sports car?None of the cars in this segment are ""sports cars."" At best, the sportiest of the bunch is a sporty Grand Tourer. The point is that all of the cars in this segment (including the TSX) are cut from the same cloth. That is, they are cars designed to offer a degree of performance and luxury above the common family car.And to meet you halfway, I'll even say that the TSX with automatic transmission is questionable as a ELLPS. The TSX's saving grace is how the entire driving experience is utterly transformed when equipped with the 6MT.I've said it before - the only people who don't think the TSX is a sport sedan (in the ELLPS context) are people who haven't really driven a 6MT TSX. Around Pacific Raceways, my old TSX was every bit as capable as the BMW 325i's sharing the track with me. It was a joy to drive fast, which is the ultimate test of a sport sedan. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," I guess Your right a sports car should weigh 3500-4000 lbs and have less the 200 hp and fwd. - the tsx is a sporty car when it's paired with the 6 speed.I drive the 04 tsx and it has the best manual transmission in the segment by far but it's not fast, it handles good for a front driver but it's not a sports car. And the fact that the current acura sales demographic is closer to Buick then BMW. Now i agree that a true sports sedan has prob died due to current weight of the group we speak of. Now for you to disagree with me is fine but what about the edmunds article that declared the jetta gli better then your tsx ? And you are right your tsx could stay with a 325 but the current tsx could not stay with the current 328 and I think that's my point, current Acura models just can't compete because they never evolve.

"tlong","October 2011"," Since when does the buying demographic have anything to do with how sporty a car is? I see a lot of irrelevance in the arguments. Perhaps some cars don't have ""sports car carpet"" either LOL! "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I've never driven a Jetta GLI so I can't comment on it. I think it's (a lot) smaller than the TSX and doesn't have as many amenities and has a less refined driveline though - not a near-luxury segment car. I do really like last years cockpit lighting and layout though - very upscale for an economy car.The TSX weighs less than any version of the A4 Audi makes. It's also lighter than the G25 and IS250. And Honda's I-4 makes similar power to both of those competitors V-6 motors. The TSX is also the epitome of a smooth refined driveline. The switchgear/cockpit ergonomics and quality is maybe a notch below Audi but certainly as good as or better than Infiniti, Lexus, and BMW.Plus, if you do own a 2004 6MT TSX, then you know the joy of revving that Honda I-4 up to 7400 RPM - only BMW's legendary I-6 is as satisfying to wind up.And talk about keeping pace - the TSX has soldiered on with the same specs for 8 years and Infiniti comes out with a brand new car that offers a mere 17 more HP and weighs almost 200 lbs more?!?! Acura must be doing something right to inspire Infiniti and Lexus to build such close competitors.Every car in this segment has an Achilles heel. The TSX is the least expensive car here, and it offers a lot of ELLPS for the money. But if you want more than 200HP, then obviously it's not the right choice. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," Govt mpg mandates have a lot to do with why Infiniti and soon BMW are taking down hp. I dont think it has anything to do with acura inspiration. Now I know the tsx offers little more then you can get in a standard accord except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge, sure it has nice leather innards but the ergonomics are subject to personal taste. , As edmunds stated in the article the gli slightly beats it as a sport car. I know the sweet vtexh and it's great action manual (whicjlh I hope stays)- but the tsx has only gotten fatter over the years - with no power boost - 90% of them are automatics and it's currently sitting in a stale stable. I'm looking for a recent article that mentions this car as being a sports sedan, one published in the last 3 years. "

"fedlawman","October 2011"," ""Now I know the tsx offers little more then you can get in a standard accord except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge.""You forgot to mention that the TSX is physically smaller inside and out and has a 4"" shorter wheelbase. It has a higher compression engine with a higher redline and 10 more HP. The TSX also has a beefier rear sway bar, high performance tires, sport suspension, sport seats, and a 6-speed MT. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," ""2 car and driver articles -- again the acura in the middle of the pack vs cars that are not considered lux cars.""Some TSX quotes from your first link...""Such a treat to drive this car after herding some of the others around the course. So much more certainty, so much more precision."" ""This is a case of all the parts working together?&#128;&#148;quick responses, crisp steering, excellent brakes, minimal body roll, and it's all so easy."" ""Just brimming with confidence. Even on a long, dull interstate, you can feel the athletic tension of the chassis, all ready to burn up some twisties. Bravo!""""As much as we love this car's precision, refinement, and athletic nature, every story we've published about it has made some sort of apology for its relatively modest power... But in this comparison, the power shortage was costly.""Your second link features the V-6 TSX, which is a nose-heavy, numb-steering pig. Not the car I'm talking about. They said it themselves...""The TSX V-6 is a smart cookie that just needs to lighten up a little. Which is code for, ?&#128;&#156;Stick with the manual-transmission, four-cylinder TSX.""So it looks like Car & Driver agrees with me. The 4 cylinder TSX with 6MT is the jewel of the Acura lineup and a superb ELLPS. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," beefier rear sway bar and all season highperformance tires-ok in other words things you can get at your local autozone.. sport suspension well thats subjective and no where on the acura website does it say sports suspension.the car and driver articles you mention did not bash the TSX but they did say the other cars were better given its middle of the pack results. 2 vws and an accord were considered better cars for the price, ELLPS hahaha. I agree that with you that its the jewel of the acura brand-- but that brand includes the RL and ZDX :confuse: "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," Well, if you really believe that, then you can't be taken seriously here. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," ?? "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," So you seriously believe that the Accord and Sonata are ELLPS's? "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," You know, I remember the discussion when the TSX first came out in 2003. Back then, it was the Mazda6 owners who challenged that the TSX wasn't a ""luxury"" car and the Mazda6 was superior because it had ""similar amenities"" and a more powerful V6 (a recurring theme...).Well, there is the difficult to articulate quality of precision, refinement, and craftsmanship that the TSX possesses in spades that more pedestrian cars lack.All you have to do is sit behind the wheel of the Sonata and you immediately know it is an economy car. One drive and you instantly feel that lack of chassis and driveline refinement.The Accord is another beast altogether. The Accord is arguably ""luxurious"" enough to compare with the bottom of the ELLPS class. It does lack some features expected here like Xenon headlights, driver memory settings, etc., but more importantly, it lacks a sporting character. It is a big car - softly sprung with flat seats. The precision and refinement are there, but it doesn't have the dynamics of a sport sedan.Yes, you could go online and get summer tires, sway bars, springs/struts and make it a handler, but then what you would have is a large, slushbox equipped, harsh riding family car (Last year, I equipped my Volvo with Bilsteins and know first-hand what a disaster that was!).So why try to shoehorn the Accord into a category it wasn't designed or suited for when Honda already makes a car that is the epitome of the ELLPS segment? A nimble, fun, refined sedan that has a terrific engine and gearbox with a modicum of luxury? "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," i never said that- but I did say the TSX should be moved from this group- it has not ""advanced"" with the rest of the group and in comparison tests it gets beat by ""lesser"" cars - in 2003 it was a player but that was 9 years ago. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I agree that it hasn't advanced in horsepower, but I don't think that alone defines this class. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," HP alone no - but what have they done to improve on the early TSX? more lbs, a v6 that no one buys, a sportwagen, lets not forget about the 5 speed auto. "
"tlong","October 2011"," I actually like the older TSX a LOT better than the new one - heavy, numb, and bloated like how all Hondas and Acuras have been heading lately. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I agree. But how is BMW any different?The 328i is the same E90 introduced in 2005 (MY2006), only it has 15 more HP and weighs 100 lbs more. It is eclipsed in HP by several cars in this segment, but it soldiered on. Why? Because it sells.It is the entry point into BMW luxury and prestige. For Acura, the TSX is the entry point into the ELLPS segment. And it sells - warts and all. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," the current tsx has also gained in weight vs the 2004-2008 model-- how many lbs well 150-- it also lost 4 hp somewhere and gained gained 8 lbs of torque during that time period. So from what you presented BMW is different --yep they added HP and weight, not vice versa. they have also tweeked it a bit since the last refresh-- and are due for another one in 2012 prob a reason why it sells...would love to see a post of something that can merit the agrument besides the fact that you own this car- one time..-a comparo test or a current write up about the sport you talk of.. it was a long time ago when they started this ELLPS blog.. maybe its time for an update with current players-- And it sellls? well it sells better then any other Acura for sure infact its almost half of all acura sales at a total of 32k units for 2010, that is in the us, canada and mexico -- but bmw sold 100k (us only sales) 3 series cars and infiniti also sold 58k of the G series (US ALONE). So i think the warts are showing more then you think. "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," There are so many cars out there that aren't fantastic at one thing, they don't look good on paper, but they are great cars to drive. My TSX is one car that falls into that category. It's 201 hp 4 cylinder is not going to win any stoplight or out of a toll booth race. You really have to drive a TSX & a V6 Accord back to back. They ""are not"" the same car.You seem to be a ""car guy"" and you know that a factory tuned suspension upgrade is so much better than one you can piece together from autozone or any various Internet site. It's like some people who say ""why do I need to spend $XX,XXX more for an M3 (or S4) when I can just chip my 335i (or A4 2.0T) for $X,XXX and get just as much or even more power?"". There's also a company out there that makes a bolt-on supercharger for a V6 Mustang. It makes the V6 good for 475 horsepower. If you were in the market for a Mustang, would you buy a 5.0 GT or a V6 and get it supercharged? I'll take the V8.I'll agree with you and fedlawman that the TSX V6 is a nose heavy pig. I personally don't think it needs to be in the Acura lineup. A V6 TSX has a sticker damn near a FWD TL & Honda puts crazy $4000 cash incentives on the V6 TSX to sell it. I have the sane gripes with C&D regarding its electric power steering. The original TSX was a smashing success for Acura. I think the 1st year they only expected to sell 15,000 units. How many did they sell that 1st year?You have to remember that us enthusiasts are a sliver of a small percentage of the market. I believe the 2 main gripes (from the general buying public) were the small-ish back seat & modest power output. They made the car bigger (adding weight) and added a V6 option (whic doesn't sell well & adds weight & torque steer) Anything the ""tuner crowd"" says Acura should use from it's parts bin will ruin the car's driving characteristics & appeal. ""Give it SH AWD"" adds weight, cost, & complexity. ""Give it the 4cyl Turbo from the RDX"" adds cost, complexity, & weight. Not to mention torque steer as well. Part of the TSX's charm & appeal in this ELLPS segment is it's price point which it gets from being built on an Accord platform (or being an Accord from the rest of the world), it's 201 horsepower 4 cyl engine, 5 speed automatic transmission (you want a 6 or an 8 speed auto, that'll cost you too), low weight, the fact that Acura even OFFERS a slick shifting 6-Speed manual transmission.Try walking on to your local BMW, Audi, MB, Lexus dealer and tell me how many 3,C,A4,IS have MSRPs under $40,000. Yes I know you can order your car any way you like it. Acura gets you into the door of this segment.Like fedlawman said, drive it against an IS250 & G25 to tell me it isn't competitive and doesn't belong. Ive never driven a G25, but have driven an IS250 AWD (high 90% of sales in the northeast) & it's 201 horsepower V6 accelerates about as fast as a Toyota Yaris. The TSX's base 4cyl is lively & happy to rev all the way to it's 7,000 RPM redline. I can tell you it has a certain Germanic ride quality to it. Very solid and extremely stable on the right side of 80 mph. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura -- OR they would sell more to the real sports fans-- pretty simple-- how many of those TSX leases out on LONG ISLAND are leased with manuals, NYC carguy?? If you want a BMW you can order a base 328 or 128 with a manual and it will outperform this TSX in every way. No one is talking about the tuner crowd here or even the IS or the G25, infact if you were watching last posts you would see the jetta and accord are now comps. We are talking about a car that has not changed in over 10 years except get bigger and heavier thus killing its sporty nature which is why it was in the EELPS but no longer should be considered. "
"m6user","October 2011"," acura does offer a Manual in both the TSX and TL which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total cars sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura Just what percent of BMWs, A4s, C300s, Gs etc etc are sold with manual trannies? I'm pretty sure it's very close to the percentage you attribute to ""non-sports"" cars. Just because they are offered doesn't mean that they sell that many. I think I read somewhere that even BMW is only about 10% sticks. I don't think that manual transmission buy rates should be the determining factor as you keep saying over and over and over again. I also know some pretty darn good car drivers that don't drive sticks for a variety of reasons and certainly not because they can't drive well. As far as the TSX goes, there has to be a entry point to this category and one person is hardly the authority. Edmunds, when comparing to the GTI, said it wasn't as good a sport car or something like that. But, they did put it in the same category. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here- anything published besides your thoughts would be of great value- the car rags or anything that can substanciate your claim- lets be serious here- the TSX is a great entry level car for someone who is looking for value luxury not sports sorry.. i love the fact that you guys are defending this once great value but again when compared to its true comp its not really the value it once was. Now if you include acura as a brand behind this car it validates my claim - they are nowhere when it comes to sport. They are behind every other major comp in almost every category and have been happy for years being an OK (middle of the road) company. "
"m6user","October 2011"," A better question would be why do you have such a vendetta against it? Acura, as a brand, may have gone astray of some their sportier past models but that doesn't change the TSX that much at least any more than other brands have grown and gotten heavier. Acura is a luxury or a near luxury brand. TSX is it's entry level offering and it's a sedan. The only questionable operative word in the title of this thread then would be performance which is somewhat subjective. So for you to set the bar is quite assuming it seems. "
"cdnpinhead","October 2011"," is this ever going to end?People who own or have driven the 1st gen TSX seem very pleased with it. One or two people who haven't seem to have a near-psychotic problem with it.It's just a car. These days anything with a manual transmission is 80% of the way to being a sports sedan. There aren't many anymore.The last time I remember things getting this weird was when there was a board on here called ""BMW 5-series or Pontiac Grand Prix GTP,"" where people who were totally invested their personal opinions went on for years (well, maybe it was months, but it seemed like years). There was a GM fanboi who just kept on and kept on and kept on.Oh well. . . "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," well the board is to talk about Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans which I feel and have shown by reviews and sales figures that it does not belong here in its current state. Others have given personal thoughts but nothing concrete on why it belongs here- i like facts over subjective comments to prove a point.and i'm spent. "
"tlong","October 2011"," ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here...Trying to prove a subjective judgement is silly. And citing car magazines (which are also subjective judgments) isn't much better. The fact that we aren't sure means it should probably be IN the discussion. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the TSX grouped in with lesser cars? your right that is silly "
"tlong","October 2011"," ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the TSX grouped in with lesser cars? your right that is sillyWell post 12200 said that facts are better than subjectivity. And all of this is subjective. Wouldn't the sensible way to approach it be to INCLUDE a vehicle if a high fraction of posters (subjectively) think it should be included? There aren't any ""facts"" that clearly put this vehicle OUT of the discussion, and for any ""facts"" one might cite, others could cite similar ""facts"" about different vehicles that would exclude those, too. :surprise: What is silly is that this forum is for just discussions. It's not like anybody has to love any car or buy any particular car. :blush:And by the way, I also feel the TSX is bloated and soft - not all that sport or luxury. But I don't see why it can't be discussed. "
"smarty666","October 2011"," There really is no subcategories of this class, such as premium, performance, etc. This category is made up of all the entry-level luxury offerings of the luxury manufacturers which are the vehicles edmunds has listed here, they just titled the thread wrong. It should be just entry-level luxury sedans, which the TSX falls into. "
"plekto","October 2011"," I can agree to that change. The problem is that the sport sedan has really been replaced with the ""Hot Hatch"" segment in Europe and almost none of it has been offered in the U.S.Small, nimble, fast, and luxurious. Tons of choices in Europe in the hatchback and B class segment. Almost none over here. We get big and heavy luxury vehicles instead. "

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," A large percentage of any of these cars are leased. You can't go by the manual transmission take rate to decide whether or not any particular car belongs in this category. The take rate for manual transmissions in the USA in general is probably less than 10%.People lease for 4 reasons:Business reasons where they can take some sort of tax deduction.They can afford to & like to be in a new car every 2-3 years.Leasing is used as an alternative method of financing that works quite well if you can live within mileage limitations.People lease to get a more expensive car at a cheaper payment. Many of these people do not understand leasing and shouldn't be doing it.There are tons of leased TSXs, TLs, 328s, 335s, A4s, IS 250s... among others in my area.

"rayainsw","October 2011"," Some details: Day 1 &#150; Friday 16 Sept. &#150; delivery & drive to Krimml, Austria:We cleared customs and collected our checked bags without incident. Service on the flight was excellent, and the food [ 2 meals ! ] was quite good. [Lufthansa A340-600.] We met Rolf [ retired BMW employee ] at the designated spot and he drove us [ in his BMW Diesel Wagon ] first to the local BMW dealer in Munich and across the street to acquire several excellent local maps and the toll vignettes [ stickers ] required in Austria and in Switzerland, then delivered us to the Welt. Just in time to watch the 11AM &#145;motorcycle on the stairs&#146; show. Interesting. Rolf charges a very reasonable fee, and it was great to just try to sit back and relax [ after a 6.5 hour flight from Boston ] while he drove and talked.We filled out the required paperwork and the customer service rep. recited a list of potentially useful information &#150; most of which I had seen before on various forums. He was quite efficient and cordial &#150; and answered a few of our questions. The reminder about &#145;no right turn on red&#146; was quite handy &#150; as this was something I had to keep reminding myself about all trip long. And I was cautioned again that Switzerland traffic police allowed no violation of their speed limits &#150; period. Noted. We had about 45 minutes until our scheduled orientation and background presentation, so we sampled various goodies in the &#147;Premier Lounge&#148;. Very nicely done & convenient &#150; high above & overlooking the vehicle delivery area.We had our presentation [ fine, nothing spectacular &#150; for me ] and went to see the car. The customer service rep. pointed out various features [ this is my first BMW ] and set various preferences [ KM vs. Miles for the trip, etc. ] and we were on our way. [ pictures ]Actually just had them park it for another half hour or so, allowing us to peruse their gift shop briefly and pick up a few food & drink items at their caf?, for the afternoon drive.They certainly treat you well and the process is well thought out - and we enjoyed the experience. We could have also done a factory tour and \ or the BMW museum, but I had decided not to do those this time, based on our priorities & our schedule.I had rented a GPS \ Navigation system with appropriate maps, and the first use was to help me drive out of Munich and onto the A8 heading south and east. Worked well here &#150; and several other times, as well. Here it was quite helpful in showing what lane[s] to be in before approaching turns, etc. once on the Autobahn, I was quite well behaved, speed-wise - even on the few unlimited stretches of this highway &#150; breaking in the new motor & all.My daughter was quite tired and dozed off as we left the A8 and headed straight south on A12 \ E45 \ E60 toward the Austrian border.The navigation system routed us differently than I had expected, and I did not realize it immediately. It also re-routed us a few times around what it saw as traffic congestion [ there was none ] so we were a couple of hours later than expected arriving at the B&B in Krimml. A lovely B&B within sight of the Falls. Had a very good dinner in their restaurant &#150; beer brewed on-site, met my daughter&#146;s approval - and we went to bed. = = =Day 2 &#150; Saturday 17 Sept. &#150; Krimml to Verona, ItalyThere had been rain overnight &#150; and there were wispy clouds around the area &#150; with thick overcast. [ pictures ] We had breakfast at about 9 and headed toward the Falls. We actually drove past the Falls and up to a couple of overlooks [ start of the Gerlos Pass \ Alpine Road &#150; pictures ] and then drove back down to park and hike in. The sun came out brilliantly as we started the trek. The hike up to various views of the Falls was fairly steep, but the scenery was quite spectacular. [ pictures ]After we finished the hike, we stopped at their caf? for coffee and an apple strudel. Excellent! We stopped back in the village to just stroll around for a while, just enjoying the ambiance.Then we were off &#150; heading up to the Gerlos Pass. The sun was out and we stopped several times to just enjoy the views. Just after passing the summit [ and paying the toll ] we pulled off at a tiny [ closed ] &#145;kiosk&#146; and scenic vista &#150; lovely lake and glaciers above. [ pictures ]Descending, there was just no where that I could pull over \ off the road to safely stop. And the road demanded attention. The views were often stunning &#150; and the road was in excellent shape [ as were most roads we encountered in Austria ] and I just needed to pay attention. My daughter really enjoyed the views!Heading back north toward the A12 \ E60 we encountered some sort of festival [ in Stumm or Fugen? ] that involved cows with elaborate &#145;headdresses&#146;. Unique in my experience.And we stopped at a McDonalds for a quick bite of lunch. Odd to see their take on menu, etc. And my daughter bought something [ delicious ] from a trailer parked in the lot next door.We hit the highway, toward Innsbruck, turned south and crossed into Italy. This is where we encountered the first real issue of the trip. I had not done sufficient research to realize that the area from before Trento to Verona was as industrialized as it was. My bad. I had expected to be able to simply [ ? ] pick an exit off the highway and find a hotel or B&B to stay for the night. This turned out to be a very bad idea. Long [ and winding = narrow switchbacks, in the dark ] story short: We finally asked a toll-taker at an exit in Verona for a recommendation at about 9PM, and stayed at a hotel just off the highway. Very basic, small rooms, but adequate & inexpensive. = = =Day 3 &#150; Sunday 18 Sept. &#150; Verona to La SpeziaWe had a surprisingly good breakfast at the hotel and then headed south, toward La Spezia. This drive was relatively uneventful, until it started to rain. The highway was well worn [ tire ruts ] in spots and even with brand new Michelins, there were times when I felt it prudent to slow somewhat. And the GPS \ nav again became confused &#150; taking us on a more circuitous route [ even narrower and more winding ] than necessary from La Spezia to Pitelli. Really, really narrow streets. Cars parked on either side. Raining. Not confident of the Nav system&#146;s routing &#150; somewhat stressful. But we did arrive &#150; and not too late = 4:30 or so in the afternoon. After settling in, we asked about a place to have dinner. A few mis-communications and assumptions and much walking later [ and rather wet ] we managed to have pizza at the only place in the village that was actually open at about 6 or 7 on a Sunday evening. It rained, often quite hard, and was quite windy until 3 or 4 AM. Then cleared and calmed. = = =Day 4 & 5 &#150; Monday & Tuesday 19, 20 Sept. &#150; Cinque Terrecontinued... "
"rayainsw","October 2011"," Day 4 & 5 &#150; Monday & Tuesday 19, 20 Sept. &#150; Cinque TerreI had decided early on [ for several reasons ] that we would park the car at the B&B and leave it there until we left on Thursday. We took a bus to La Spezia and then the train to each of the villages &#150; bus stop right across from the B&B.I will not detail everything here. Suffice to say that the scenery and the town buildings are everything we expected, and even more! The color of the water was striking &#150; and the surf generated by the overnight storm added interest and texture. Beautiful. [ pictures ] The high temperatures were a bit warmer than is typical for this time of year all 3 days &#150; but cool each morning, for breakfast outside on the deck.We had gelato each day we stayed here. In fact twice one day - outstanding!! The lunch each day in the different villages was quite good. And the sight-seeing was just amazing. = = =Day 6 &#150; Wednesday 21 Sept. - S. Terenzo and Lerici.The woman who runs the B&B where we were staying suggested that we would enjoy spending some time walking through these two local villages. We did. Interesting architecture. Beautiful old church &#150; castles &#150; lovely. And we had a very good lunch right at the harbor. I&#146;m guessing we walked over 4 miles this day &#150; much of it up and down the hills. But worth every step.Day 7 &#150; Thursday 22 Sept. &#150; La Spezia to S. Bernadino, Switzerland Despite our prior experience, we decided to try the same strategy that had blown up in our faces before &#150; meaning: look for a place to stay for the night, off the highway, once well into Switzerland.Circling around Milan to the southeast, we headed toward Como. Again, the vistas were lovely, but safely pulling off the road to stop and really enjoy them was problematic.[ pictures ]At one point [ perhaps near Chiavenna? ] my daughter noted that one of several waterfalls [ dropping hundreds of feet from the peaks on either side of he road that wound up the valley floor ] looked like we might be able to exit and drive back to see it somewhat closer. She was correct [ that happened a lot ] and it was well worth the slight &#145;detour&#146;. [ pictures ]We ended up staying at an exquisite little hotel in San Bernardino. Just before the entrance to the San Bernardino tunnel, this a tiny old village &#150; primarily geared to skiing. We were &#145;off-season&#146; and the town was very quiet. The water in the creek running through town was clear. The air was crisp, cool and clear. Just lovely. We had excellent fondue for dinner in the hotel&#146;s restaurant and slept well &#150; enjoying the fresh mountain air &#150; at over 5,000 feet elevation. Day 8 &#150; Friday 23 Sept. S. Bernardino to Memmingen, GermanyWe had another excellent breakfast [ more wonderful bread ] at the hotel and headed north. On the Autobahn [ 96 \ E54 \ E43 ] approaching Memmingen, I had my one opportunity to briefly explore the outer limits of [ my experience in ] LEGAL, very high speed driving. A break in traffic [ Friday PM ] allowed a quick blast to 135+ MPH. Exhilarating. But traffic again intervened and I was back to 100 &#150; 115, or so on most of the unlimited sections. This was also the case the next day, Saturday, going to the Munich airport &#150; generally able to hold a steady 100, with a few blasts to 115 or so &#150; then back to 100. Holding 115 MPH for a few minutes at one point was quite satisfying. Being passed while doing 100 MPH by Porsches [ and others, but most often Porsches ] clearly doing 140, 150 MPH or more was quite an experience as well!We arrived in Memmingen in time to spend a few hours exploring the old city area, town square, churches, etc. We ate dinner at the hotel - very good.Day 9 = final day &#150; Saturday 24 Sept. &#150; Memmingen to Munich Airport and fly back to BostonWe slept well, until a local, nearby church rang the &#147;100 o&#146;clock&#148; bells. The ringing just kept on and on &#150; at 7AM. Oh, well &#150; time to rise and shine. Another very traditional breakfast at the hotel, an hour or so at the farmers&#146; market in the town square [ best looking produce and fruit I have ever seen ! ] and we packed up for the last leg of our journey. We drove to a car wash, then to a final fuel stop [ ended with exactly the quarter tank the shipper recommends ] and drove to the airport to drop the car off, and [ after waiting in several lines, including 2 security checkpoints, since we were flying to the US ] we flew home without incident.A few overall impressions:This was a wonderful trip. It is hard to describe the feeling of driving for miles through what looks like the biggest postcard in the world. Large areas of both Switzerland and Austria were absolutely magnificent and spectacular. Cinque Terre was all we had hoped. We spent 2 full days exploring and enjoying all 5 towns and it was amazing. The other 2 small villages we visited near the B&B on our third day there were a charming surprise as well.The times I was stressed were mostly a result of no experience driving anywhere in Europe and knowing very little German or Italian. [ Meaning, mostly my fault. ] I do not expect to return to Europe anytime in the next few years [ if ever ] and my daughter had downloaded a translation app. For both Italian and German - so did not expend a lot of time or effort trying to learn the languages. Some of the country and village roads in Italy were scary narrow. And I wish they had the option to just buy a sticker for use of their toll roads. My one &#145;incident&#146; [ scraped the left front rim ] was while struggling to deal with an un-attended toll booth at an exit somewhere south of Trento after dark. I drove too close to the curb, trying to understand and deal with the instructions and reach the ticket \ credit card slots, etc. [ sigh ] Oh, well.Why not Rome or Florence or Milan or Venice, one might ask? My daughter spent over a week in Italy a couple of years ago, and had an opportunity to visit each of those places. And I was just personally much more interested in the Austrian and Swiss Alps and the Italian Mediterranean coast than the cities. We were both quite happy with our choices!The car &#150; 2011 335iS Coupe, Le Mans Blue, Gray Leather, DCT, Premium Package, Comfort Access, Heated Front Seats, Satellite Radio.http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/10q3/2011_bmw_335is-short_take_road_test- - I test drove 2 cars equipped essentially identical to what I bought, except they both had the optional 19&#148; wheels & tires. For me & for my typical driving, I decided that the 18s would be fine &#150; and offer a somewhat better ride. The car was delivered with Michelin Pilots &#150; excellent tires. continued... "
"rayainsw","October 2011"," Given that every time I drove &#145;my&#146; new car, it had my daughter in the co-pilot&#146;s seat and a trunk full of our luggage, I was very impressed with the acceleration and response at every speed and under every condition. [ I am really looking forward to driving it with only me in the car ! ] The performance exhaust system is perfect, for me. The DCT is a jewel, manually or automatically upshifting very, very quickly & with precision, and no perceptible interruption in the flow of TQ application. Very smooth &#150; and fun! And downshifting manually with perfect rev-match every time. Very impressive.I found the ride [ even with fairly low profile RFTs ] to be absolutely perfect &#150; at any speed and on every surface we encountered.I certainly did not stress the car, handling-wise, with my daughter along and driving unfamiliar roads &#150; but under all conditions the steering feel, response and the balance were confidence-inspiring. Dynamically, I find this BMW a near perfect blend of practicality and performance. I enjoyed almost the entire driving experience [ exceptions noted above ] and I am really looking forward to re-delivery here in [ says BMW ] 6 to 8 weeks.Why the 335iS? Having driven more than one 335i with Steptronic previously, I was most interested in the additional HP, and [ particularly ] the additional TQ and the 7-speed Dual Clutch Transmission of the &#145;iS&#146;. The handling poise of the 335 with a significant bump in acceleration and better gear shifting was enough to draw me in to test one. FWIW: I am quite satisfied with the &#145;iS&#146; &#150; and [ for acceleration and handling context ] my previous car was a Corvette.set full screen mode [ option bottom right &#150; and \ or F11 on firefox ] end enjoy http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v298/rayainsw/BMW%20Euro%20Deliv/?albumview=sl- ideshow "
"cdnpinhead","October 2011"," that was great. I've been to Europe several times and was able to absorb how things work at company expense during my first 3-4 visits; I can appreciate how hard it would have been to have taken such an ambitious journey as a maiden voyage. By the time I took my wife over I had a much better grip on things, one of which was when to ignore the GPS.I also enjoy the Swiss & Austrian Alps -- thanks for the descriptions & photos. I arrived last year too late to use some of the prettier passes, but there's always next time. Northern Italy may be on the agenda as well, given your great intro.Parking and using shanks mare & public transit has a lot to recommend it, though I find it hard to do with a rental that's costing a pretty penny each day it sits -- you didn't have that issue.Wow, just over a week ago. You'll have those memories forever. Thanks again for taking the time to share your trip in such detail. "

"graphicguy","October 2011"," Yes....Thanks, Ray! What a great report. Maybe NYC can give us a report on driving his TSX around NY. :P Actually, I think the TSX is a sports sedan that appeals to a different demographic than some would think. I know my son's friends (all early 20s) love the TSX. Seems as if that feeling switches once that 30+ year old threshold has been passed.I've had a TSX loaner when I still had my TL in for service. They're really nice cars. Decent power....handle well.....relatively comfy.....lots of options as standard. "

I just bought a 2011 328i sedan with the M3 package and 6spd Manuel from a dealer. But we are going to get a 535i next spring and will do the Euro delivery on that car. Its going to be a nice trip..

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," Took the TSX ""out to the ball game"" on Friday night, watched 1.5 innings of baseball, then sat through an hour & a half rain delay until the game was postponed until Saturday night. The TSX's backup camera made street parking a snap. Took the TSX back to the game on Saturday night & saw one of the most amazing baseball games ever.I appreciate your candid thoughts on the TSX & tremendously respect your opinion. I'm sure your TL SH AWD would run rings around it. At the price point, it's not bad though. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Ray, I have been looking forward to your write up. You did not let us down. I wonder why you stated you will probably never return? My wife and I have been to Germany about 25 times -- and we have taken the train from Munich to Venice (which goes through Verona) so many times we cannot remember, but each trip has always been better than the one before it. Breathtaking scenery, excellent sometimes food-gasmic meals (especially in Italy) -- the 5 course meals on the train trip to Venice are all Italian and all very nice, considering the food is on a train.We've stayed in Verona many times and we are fortunate enough to have access to a relatives apartment in Venice -- although we have stayed in many hotels in Venice, including the Danieli (worth saving up for.) We find virtually every part of Europe worth a return visit is the point. Why will you not be returning, pray tell?Loved the running commentary about the car, its transmission, tires, etc and even your reason for choosing it over others. Nice job!And, thanks!  "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have been reading the endless running commentary apparently about the inclusion of the TSX in this discussion forum. I tend to agree the TSX doesn't fit in with the other cars -- I am on day three of having a loaner TSX while my TL gets backup sensors installed (I live in Cincinnati and the dealer is in Columbus, and I travel to Columbus every Saturday, so here I sit with a TSX and an '09 Audi A4 Prestige/Sport (tiptronic) at my disposal.)Over the weekend I drove both cars extensively -- I prefer the Audi, DUH! But the TSX was ""a very nice little car."" It seems outclassed by the other cars in this forum, but, I say let it stay here and let's not bash it. It seems the TSX is a fine machine, but is somewhat lacking in both lux and performance characteristics -- for MY taste.Let's move on, let's accept the fact that ALL of these cars are fine machines in their own right. They can't all be BMW's or Audi's or whatever your ideal is of an ELLPS. I think I have driven virtually all of the cars listed at the top of the page -- I like some better than others, but, overall I think they are ALL mighty fine.Since I just leased a new TL, I would assume you might think I am going to tell you how great the TL is and how it could kick your fill-in-the-blank car's butt. Maybe it could, maybe it couldn't. I didn't get it for that reason -- I got it because of its value. I may live to regret buying on that criteria -- I'll let you know.I will be turning in my Audi this week -- I will miss it. At 53,000 miles it feels like it is about a 20,000 mile old car -- and since the tires have plenty of tread, it still performs better than most cars on the highway. But, so does the TL SH-AWD Advance. While the Audi is ""better"" (as far as I am concerned) I just don't see that the price premium the Audi commands is justified. That is just me, perhaps -- I know that (finally) Audis are once again selling well, most reliability issues are behind it (I can testify, however, that I NEVER had reliability issues with 28 of my 29 Audis), its style always turns head and the driving experience is only rivaled by Infiniti and Acura -- and BMW, of course.Yet, you know, the S60 is the car I would have most liked to have leased for 36 months if there would have been ANY wiggle room in the S60 cap cost (which there was ZERO). If you have driven an S60 T6, you know what I am talking about -- it seems like a hell of a lot of fun. Truth be told, I thought the S60 T6 was more fun than a new 3 series X-drive flavor. The CTS too, had its merits, but one deal breaker -- no OMG handles for the driver or front-seat passenger (whose dumb idea was THAT?!?) I wouldn't take the CTS seriously for that one omission -- and for love nor money, you couldn't get blind spot warning on a CTS 4-door sedan (again, at this price point, in this class, a serious omission, specially when you can get a Taurus with it for pity's sake.)Anyway, I pretty much like or love most of the cars in this class -- they are the right size, the right power (usually) and make an old fart like me feel like I am driving something that can outperform virtually anything else on I-71 and I-75 here in the Big Town of Cincinnapolis.Drive it like you live.I'll sign off now, knowing I am often wrong, but NEVER uncertain.Mark :surprise: "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," Ray good recap . Always wanted to know what the process and experience with this program- it was a good break from the TSX bashing/ lovefest of the past week, and after reading this it also clarifies what lux and sport should be for me. It must be cool being able to explore the limits, something you can't do on the LIE. "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Wow Mark, it takes the dealer that long to install the back-up sensors?I had mine plus the wood wheel and wood gear shift knob installed in a day. I had the 09 TSX as a laoner as well, nice car but not for me.I try to upgrade with every new car, the next one I get is going to be a beast, probably a V8 Mercedes.Secondly, I have learned that some of the posters on these boards, their words are just wind. They drive around in (mass production)RWD/AWD V6 and think that their car is special, you would probably think they own a RR Ghost or Phantom the way they rant. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," No, it takes one day to install the back-up sensors. I live in Cincinnati, the purchasing dealer (where I also purchased the sensors from, and incorporated them into the lease now that they can be capitalized) is in Columbus.100 miles separate these cities.I travel EVERY Saturday to Columbus. The arrangement was this -- drop off the car, pick up the loaner, then pick up the car the following Saturday. This, for better or worse, gives me the use of the TSX for about a week.I am able to note the Acura upgrades to what is essentially a Honda of some kind (people here say it is an Accord). The fit and finish and the interior are certainly somewhat upgraded over what you would get in a Honda.But, despite these upgrades and the requirements for premium fuel, the TSX doesn't, to me, represent an entry into the ELLPS crowd. But, as I said, live and let live, keep it in and we'll see what happens.I would think that the TSX would be ""naturally"" cross-shopped with an Audi A3 -- for instance. But, as I said, I cross shopped a 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance with an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige Tiptronic and, for fun, I drove a Premium Plus S4, more or less stripped of the lux bits and w/o the Sport Differential (Torque Vectoring). Also, I shopped the Acura against a CTS/4 Luxury Edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifters as well as against a Volvo S60 T6 and against an Infiniti G37X/S and an M37X Premium+Tech. Having just come from a 2008 BMW (my wife's), I did not look at a 3 series, my German preferences satisfied with the A4 and/or S4.To me, these cross shopping adventures seem MOSTLY rational (the M37X is an outlier) -- I would not have considered a TSX anymore than I would have considered an A3, for instance.I drove my 2009 A4 Prestige with the 19"" sport package to work, yesterday -- today I drove the TSX in. I would say the differences were like Filet Mignon vs Laura's Lean hamburger patties. I like both of them, but prefer the filet, by far.I did test drive both of the Audis and the Acura on the same Saturday in June -- I also test-drove the CTS I mentioned. The Acura was, best I can describe, like an Audi AS4 quattro if such a model actually existed.Anyway, sorry to digress -- again -- but the back-up sensors are not taking this long, the issue is where I live vs where I bought. Once the sensors are in, I will either use a Cincinnati Acura dealer for service or I will take advantage of Lindsay Acura's Saturday service for things like oil changes and tire rotation, etc. "

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," About the slaughtering my TSX has taken lately. I'm going to somewhat agree with Sweendogy and say that my TSX is a ""Sporty Sedan"" instead of an all out ""Sports Sedan."" Considering some of the cars its being considered to by some posters here (no disrespect to anybody in particular), might not be entirely fair. A fully loaded up almost $50,000 A4 with Quattro, Sports Suspension, and Torque Vectoring Rear Differential. I would hope the Audi drives a whole helluva lot better. Same thing with a TL-SH AWD.The TSX V6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and you'd have to really hate the base TL to buy a TSX V6 with a similar MSRP (even though the V6 TSX is loaded with incentives most of the time).Where does the TSX go from here? You can't give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy. You can't give it Acura's SH-AWD because that will add weight and price.The TSX is a great car. I own one and love it. It has a taut suspension, adequate acceleration, fantastically supportive seats. It it fun to drive, gets good gas mileage...I'm happy with the decision I made to buy it. I've got over 41,000 miles on it after only 25 months. In a little less than 3 years it will be paid off and I'll hopefully be able to drive it relatively trouble free for well past the 100,000 mile mark.If there was never a cash for clunkers program, we drove our leased X3 for the entire 3 years and it had 60K miles instead of 45K for 3 years, would I have even set foot into an Acura dealership? Probably not. If something happened to my TSX today, would I get another one? I'm not so sure. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," nyc.....in that mid $30s price range, I think the TSX is ""right there"" with the likes of an A4 or 328i (both discounted).I've taken a couple of stabs at liking Infinitis. None of them ever made it to the top of my ""want it"" list. I think they lack the refinement I got used to with Acuras, BMWs ,etc.The TSX should at least be given a look in the sport(y) sedan category based on the value equation. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," To get an Audi in the A4 body style WITH torque vectoring (aka Sport Differential), one would need to move up the ladder to the S4 -- and, typically, the one with the Sport Differential and Audi Drive Select, etc, etc, etc, will be closer to $60,000.I was very pleased to get an all tarted up TL Advance SH-AWD with accessories for under $48K -- and although it still isn't an S4, it presents itself very well in the class of cars we go on about here as well as being able to perform with near S4 capabilities.I'm still in my loaner TSX -- and wondering why Acura doesn't offer the thing with SH-AWD; seems it would be a killer car based on what -- a $2,000+ bump for the AWD? :confuse: "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I think be because the TL is the bread & butter of the Acura lineup. Acura probably doesn't want the ""lesser"" TSX to steal sales from the TL. The TSX is Acura's entry level car (that actually has more trunk space than the TL). They want you to buy (or lease) a TSX, then trade up to a base TL a few years later, then to a TL SH AWD not too long after that, & be so happy with the cars/brand that you buy (or lease) an MDX for your wife every few years.A V6 TSX Tech Stickers for high $30's. Add SH-AWD to that and you've got a close to $40K TSX. Maybe come trade up time you say ""I like my TSX SH-AWD, but don't think the TL SH AWD warrants the price jump."". Maybe you go look at Infiniti or BMW or MB...I'm not comparing the cars, but kinda like the reason Porsche messes with the Cayman's gearing and won't give it too big a motor to protect the 911. "

"sweendogy","October 2011"," Dido - the tsx was great in it's early form or even integra form. Value plus sport - newer models are bloated like Josh Beckett/ sired they perform good but will never beat a good team with the playoffs on the line. "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I agree the Acura is much more refined than the Infiniti. I had an opportunity to drive my Uncle's G37X sedan. Besides being an absolute road rocket, I was ultra impressed with the car's balance & handling. Felt like the car was turning on an axis. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," nyc.....I've made a couple of stabs at testing a G. They're good cars. They kind of cover the gamut. The G25 targets the TSX, probably an A4 and a 328i. The G37 seems to target 335i. I believe the TL SH AWD is up the ladder a little from the G, however. While the G37 is fast, I feel my 335i is faster with more neutral handling and a better ride. Refinement in both the TL and the 3 are much higher than in the G.So, as mentioned before, the G tries to cover a lot of ground.My fear (and one of the main reasons I bought the '11 3) is that BMW is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. Nothing inherently wrong with that. Audi's been doing that for years with their A4. But, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least we'd accept.Mark...I tried to find an S4 at both The Audi Connection and in Dayton. All they had were used ones. As you say, you get about 95%+ of an S4 in the TL SH AWD, for a whole lot less money. Interesting enough, the Cincinnati Audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new cars....a few A4s, a few A6s....one A7 and a splattering of the Qs. Nothing that grabbed me. And, I went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. The guys at Beechmont had 3-S4s, and a whole lot of A4s, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay a premium over my TL SH AWD when push came to shove.Now, if either of them had stocked an A5 or S5 (which they didn't), my decision might have been different. The only A5s they had were convertibles and I don't think the new S5 was out yet. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The Audi Connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the European (at least the German) way of buying a car: visit dealer, look at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait. No instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide, ""let's go buy a new car. . .TODAY!"" and we're off to the races. We leave our houses late on a Saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, we've picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a Chinese restaurant for some take out.Sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at Lowes.The Germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)I was lucky that the AC had a basically stripped S4 in stock a few months ago (an '11). It didn't even have nav (at THAT price). It had the DSG tranny and it had, apparently, HUGE urge. It felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the A4 (non sport) or the TL, although at full cry the TL's 3.7L motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the A4 2.0T). The great thing about the Audi's is that they use FSI and are either Super or Turbo charged. Imagine for 30 seconds what the TL 3.7 SH-AWD would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5L now enjoys.Acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a ""TL/S"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better brakes (Brembo's with the cool looking caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in. Perhaps it could move the AWD bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/S"" on the trunk lid (subtle visual cues that only Acura aficionados would appreciate.) I'd probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the Advance 19"" wheel, only different.Perhaps this would add too much to the MSRP and the Acura Advantage (VALUE) would, for many, vanish and they would get the SLine A4 or the S4 or the Volvo S60 R Design, or even the Bimmer.I would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more performance oriented TL. After all, look at the performance leanings of -- wait for it -- Lexus for pity's sake, LEXUS!Sir your High Performance La-Z-Boy is ready. Never thought THAT would happen!C'mon Acura -- you've clearly got some great engines (thinking of Indy cars, for example) in your DNA, let 'em out. Let My people go. :surprise: "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," The price of the G cars have gone up to a point that makes a BMW is better choice. For the price of my 2011 328i out the door, was the same price for a base G37, my 328 isn't a base car. So price was the advantage of the G car but that isn't happening today. So why would someone get a G37 when you can get a BMW for the same price... The BMW for me is a much more refined car then the G, and the Car mag's have stated the same thing. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The G37, from a performance perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.Go on-line to Infiniti and select a G37 or 37X (and you can, if you like even go for the ""S"" models). Crank the options to 11 and you will find the G remains available with an MSRP that begins with a ""$4"" -- with a 328HP engine and Premium Package, Navigation Package, Sport Package, Technology Package, Interior Accents Packge, Rear Decklid Spoiler and Midnight Black Grille Package, Splash Guards, Stainless Steel Illuminated Kick Plates, LED Daytime Running Lights and Interior Accent Lighting all for an MSRP of: $46,940. This car IMHO is not comparable to a BMW 328.Now, I am not in any way suggesting that the BMW is not a ""superior"" vehicle (Car & Driver, despite loving the G, loves the BMW even more). Many magazine writers do opine that Infiniti's G37 and G37X are Japanese Bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the G in the #2 spot.Well, hell, try to equip the comparable BMW 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the G above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the BMW's MSRP under $50,000.""Again, I am not suggesting that the BMW is #2 in this contest -- I am simply suggesting that a G equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the Bimmer would probably show the Infiniti it's butt quite a bit of the time.But if you're looking for VALUE, the Infiniti must be at the top of the list. A G37 (X or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7L motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a comfortable commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.For the price, the Bimmer just can't cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, I said ""for the price.""Additionally, the G's have very very attractive lease programs -- often better than BMW's attractive programs. :shades: "

Sorry way wrong- they have not produced a car in 10 years that was sport- NsX died a long time ago so did the Acura ""sports"" claim.

If you did make the comparison you are, your 328i is going to lack almost 100hp, bi-xenon headlights, navigation, and a couple of other little toys and tech you only get in the 335 when ordered that your getting for the same price in the G37. I do agree though that the BMW is more refined then the G, but definitely not the best bang for the buck yet. I'm eagerly awaiting the next gen 2013 G and 3 series. It should be interesting to see what Infiniti and BMW do with their bread and butter vehicles. "
"kyfdx","October 2011"," Stopped by to look at the G series today.... we were a little too ragged out to drive one.... But, they have decent lease deals.. 39mo./39K lease on a G37X with premium pkg (MSRP about $41K) for $440/mo.+tax.. with around $900 total due at signing.. Add sport package for another $10/mo.That's better than Audi or BMW, right now.. and.. 328 HP... "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," Yes the G37 has 100 more HP, but as I wrote what I paid for my 328 is very close to the base price of a G37, there is no way you are going to get Nav, bi-xenon headlights or other goodies that I have on my 328 in that G37. The base price for a G37S is far more then what I paid for my 328i. Now if one wants to compare the average price of a 335i to a G37S the BMW is better value. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," which base did you beat the G37 which is 37k even or the 41500 for a fully loaded G37S-- you lost me because you mentioned both..with haggling you can get a G for 2-4k off each car given the dealer. how much did you pay, was this a cpo?  does your car have the sports package, navi, rear camera like the G37s has?does your car have the headlights, sunroof, leather, and paint (500bux extra for Bmw) that the G37 base has?I dont have the avg price people are paying for the 335 or the G37S but given the options that are standard on the G its got to be close to 8k..maybe more--i own a G and want a 335- "
"m6user","October 2011"," Just did a quick build on each website and the 328xi comparably equipped(as I could get) was about $5k more than the G37x. Plus you get the +100hp to boot with the G. The 328 may be a little better driver and smoother runner but for value it's hard to beat the G. Infinitis are extremely reliable and trouble free for the most part. I have one(QX4) that is 9 years old and it has had only two repairs(exhaust resonator and power antenna) other than scheduled maint. "
"smarty666","October 2011"," Nah, they are taking 4k off a fully loaded G37 at my two local Infiniti dealers and I'll bet it is similar in discounts your received on your 328i so the G still in all trims is a better bang for your buck then the 328i. Also a G37 is fully loaded with nav, sport, etc for around 44k, before any discounts. It still undercuts the 335i in price. As almost all the 335i my local BMW has are priced in the high 40s to low 50s. The G even undercuts that price. I'm not saying the 328i or 335i are bad vehicles, in fact I really liked them when I test drove both but they still don't compare to the bang for buck of G. "
"wireless","October 2011"," Something I noticed this weekend when reading a somewhat favorable review of the 2012 Acura TL: They have a new 3.7L engine with 305 HP @6000 rpm and 273 pound-feet @5000 rpm. How is it that the MB C350 (pretty much the same price) has a 3.5L and it has 302 HP @6500 rpm with 273 pound-ft @3500 rpm. One thing I would give Honda is that they were always able to wring the HP out of their small engines even if they had to rev them to 9k rpms. Now they need an engine almost 6% larger just to match MB and the peak torque is at a relatively high 5k rpm. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," I think you are assuming too much, each region is completely different when it comes to discount, rebates, leases and equipment. I know here on the west side of the country Infiniti is hurting for cars, so discounts are far and few. So when I do a comparison its done with the fact of what the prices were I live. The Base price for a G37 is $36K, and it does not come with Nav, now to add the Tech package to get Nav and Sport package is $41K. This was more then my 328 with M sport package. The G37 sport is 41K.. Just for the record my BMW is 328i with M sport package, with value package which includes leather, ipod connection (free) moonroof, and access entry, cost out the door was $37K. This includes 4yr 50K of free maintenance and service, I tend to run my BMWs hard and go through brakes, the clutch is covered under BMWs warranty so if needed, I wont have to pay anything, something Infiniti does not do. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," good luck with the 328i nice car with the M package. If your looking at 6speed manuals which i love, btw, the infiniti fully loaded is 41k, there is not add on packages to get-whats in the box is in the box if you get the G with the manual.. and your right certain areas are offer different discounts BUT you have to remember BMW 3 series is changing for 2012 and the company wants all stock out the door. Now the maintenance is interesting... if you are like me and don't drive say 8-10k miles a year your looking at 1 tire rotation and 2 oilchanges a year- and if you are looking at somewhat equal cars (335) the 5-8-10k (whatever the dollar amt is) is not worth the free maintenace that all bmw owner crow about. Trust me I have the G and have spent 500 bux total in 4years- they run like tops. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," Having test driven the G37x (coupe) and bought a 335i xDrive, I can say that the 3 has more HP than BMW is claiming. Plus, it's usable power, all through the rev range. The G is a good car. But, comparatively, the 335 is very easy to drive very fast. Still, not a bad car between the two.kyfdx...I had mentioned you can get BMW's factory performance upgrade for the 335 to add 20 HP for $600. I just got it done on Friday.

"graphicguy","October 2011"," I debated the upgrade. I agree that BMW is readying for the new 3.But, 20 HP is 20 HP. I liked the car enough to buy it to begin with. I like it more now. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," At the price point and at the ""class"" (ELLPS) we are talking about, the value leaders remain Infiniti and Acura. More content and by some definition, I'm sure, more car for the money when you're comparing Infiniti to BMW (which seems to be the comparison that ""everybody"" makes); I think I'll compare Acura to Audi, for the time being -- it seems somehow to work for me.The G37XS was a car I wanted to like -- but I was smitten with the M37X which seems to me to be priced (lease price per month) at about what an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige goes for or what a BMW 335 (with x-drive and a fair amount of options) goes for. The G37XS after coming from an Audi A4 (2009 vintage) seemed ""cramped"" -- too narrow and with, apparently, no expanse of hood to speak of.Yet, the G was pretty well loaded and was very spunky -- gobs of power, albeit with a little harshness as the RPM's moved toward red-line (neither the Audi or BMW engine seem harsh.) Had the car been at least 2"" WIDER, I might have gone Infiniti rather than Acura. I certainly feel Infiniti, as a brand, has the LPS ""vision"" (whatever the hell THAT means) whereas neither Lexus nor Acura seem to have much of a clue.But, I got behind the wheel of the TL Advance and it WAS wider, I could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the engine compartment and the sound of the 3.7L at full cry is quite pleasing. Too bad the TL isn't quite as quick feeling as the G -- but man, the TL has the G in smoothness -- the TL is like butta!I am growing, slowly, very slowly, to accept the looks of the TL (exterior), I am pleased with the interior -- the seats are almost Audi quality and they are ventilated (a must have, I am almost embarrassed to say.)The TL is -- on paper -- damn near the perfect definition of an ELLPS (but ONLY in Advance trim or Tech trim with a 6 speed, based on reviews -- and ONLY if it is SH-AWD equipped.) Here's a 1,500 mile review:Smooth and quiet: checkFeels bigger than it is: checkIs, technially, bigger than some of the others in this class: check, checkBest factory sound system ever: checkVery quick, very responsive transmission (especially with the paddle shifters): checkThick, meaty steering wheel, great ""sporty"" seats: check, checkFeature set is at least as good as the other ELLPS's: checkTorque Vectoring reduces (a lot) the sensation of understeer: checkDecent Gas Mileage (combined 26 according to the center display): check (this thing is almost stingy with gas, in fact): checkAnd the list of positive attributes could go on and on.I do like driving the TL -- very much -- I don't regret getting it, especially at $499/mo plus tax, and, so far, the dealer seems terrific (Lindsay Acura, Columbus, Oh.)However, the sum of its parts pretty much equals, er, the sum of its parts. Audi and BMW (and I'll assume Mercedes) somehow seem to imbue their cars with ""something"" that makes them feel like MORE than the sum of their parts.It's not that the TL seems flimsy or not stiff and firm -- it does. But there is something that is lacking -- something that a new A4 Prestige Sport or a new 335 x-drive will have and you will notice instantly. In some ways, for the price, the TL outdoes (content wise) both Audi and BMW by a wide margin. In other ways, the TL seems like the best damn appliance Electrolux ever made -- take it away Kelly Ripa! 34 payments to go. . . :surprise: Klikie Klikie :blush: "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," Mark....you and I have the same tastes and opinions. I agree with your entire assessment. Although, I liked the styling of the TL. It was bold, and not to be confused with anything else. That was a winner in my book.Who knows, another TL may grace the GG estate in the future. It just won't be in the near future.Have fun with your TL. Sounds like you're really starting to enjoy it. "

"shipo","October 2011"," Yeah, why bother having a car with superior handling dynamics when you can have one which looks good? :P "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," My TL has 245 x 40 x 19""'s which seem adequate -- or, better said, would be adequate if the tires were at least UHP's.I assume Acura chose the RS-A's for two reasons:#1 They got a deal from Goodyear, and#2 Customers didn't care for the Summer Only rubber that Acura had chosen previously.Too many folks here and on all the other ""purpose"" sites [non-permissible content removed] and moan about the dearth (and death) of manual transmissions. Yet manufacturers, like Acura, in this case, offer them up and 1-3% of their customers acutally buy them. If I were the manufacturer, I would seriously consider dropping something THAT unpopular unless there was virtually no cost to keep them at least in the brochure (since very few dealers will ever stock one of them.)Likewise, other good deeds don't go unpunished -- my 2009 Audi A4 with the 19"" sport package came with Max Performance Dunlops -- SUMMER only tires. My dealer claims they never stocked the A4 with that sport package because the customers kept the summer tires on year 'round and had drivability issues or tire damage issues, etc. So, no mo' UPH or higher rated tires, typically -- because of customer disatisfaction. And, for the most part it is hard to find a car in this price range that doesn't come with A/S shoes.The list of other options or combination of options that manufacturers try to bring to the buying public that no one buys keeps on comin' -- so to combat this, the manufacturers bundle as much content as they can (or as they dare) into base, plus and max packages and pretty much disallow a la carte selection.Those that do allow you to add individual options often require that you first pony up for plus or max packages before they let you add your individual choices of extras. Case in point, to get the 19"" wheel/tire sport package on an Audi A4, I first had to agree to buy the A4 configured as a Prestige model. No 19"" wheels for the proletariat.Acura pissed me off -- a bit -- by not allowing me to select the blind spot warning system unless I went with the Advance designation; now that I have the Advance, I am glad, since I also got the 19"" wheels (albeit with crappy tires) and ventilated (heated AND cooled) seats along with the BSW system.Of course every manufacturer here in ELLPS land seems to want you to buy off the lot, rather than order the car and wait for it to be made exactly to your specifications. Hence, we get essentially only two or three ""package"" choices.I'd like to see more than one tire choice offered to those willing to wait for their cars to be built; I'd also like to have a greater choice of interior and exterior color choices. Why is it that I couldn't get pearl white paint and the umber leather interior, but I could get crystal black with umber? Who's dumbass rule is that anyway?The list of incomprehensible rules regarding how we can configure a $45,000+ car never ceases to amaze. I guess there would have to be some rules -- especially since most of these cars are leased (the residual value of a purple car with a white leather interior would be, after all, low, lower, lowest) -- but if the customer is willing to pay for something (not a one off, mind you) that you are already offering -- just not in that combination -- TAKE THE CUSTOMER's MONEY for pity's sake!Why are back-up sensors NOT a factory option on an Acura TL? My dealer broke the rear bumper (which is, essentially, plastic) trying to install them (since the bumber has to be drilled), then after the bumper was repaired, the bumper had to be specially repainted since I had to be so lucky as to have pearl-effect paint (137 coats or some such thing).The dealer didn't make any money on THAT transaction -- and even they wonder why such a popular option on this class of car is not standard equipment (within the technology or advance packages) or at least a FACTORY installed option.Where was I? What time is it? Oh yeah -- who in the wide, wide world of sports decided to put RS-A's on the top o' the line TL?Drive it like YOU live! :surprise: "

"graphicguy","October 2011"," mark....billy....I have a dealer who I buy my Acura products from (if I'm in the market for an Acura). Any year, any color combo, any equipment level, any model. If they have to find one for me, they will. The deal is a skinny one.Then again, I've bought 3 Acuras from the same dealership, same sales person. It's really simple dealing with them and I always get a good deal.Same way with BMWs. I go to the same dealership, deal with the same salesperson (who's been there for 24 years). If they don't have what I want, they'll do their best to find it (a little bit harder with BMWs, it seems). Again, they always do a skinny deal with no hassle. And, I've also bought multiple BMWs from them.I've never been able to deal with either the local Infiniti dealer, nor the local Audi dealer. Neither likes to do skinny deals...no matter how easy the deal would be.However, driving 50-75 miles in either direction of me, and the Infiniti dealers and the Audi dealers are more than happy to make skinny deals.Go figure.Mark...you know the dealerships (Audi Connection, Infiniti of Cincinnati) I'm talking about. I don't even bother shopping the local Audi dealership anymore when I'm in the market. They don't have a good selection, and all they want to do is order what you might want (or seek it out from another dealer). Then, they make you wait to get it, all the while offering little in the way of a discount for your trouble. The Infiniti dealer usually has good stock, but doesn't seem to like to get skinny on a purchase (Audi and Infiniti dealerships owned by the same principal). Maybe their focus is on leasing. But, I'm a purchase customer, not a lease customer.That diamond white paint on the TL is super expensive. I had to have body work done on my diamond white TL and the shop that did the work said it was a multi-step process, and hard to get right. Hand it to Acura to pull off such a feat on a production car. It is stunning looking, however.billy...I liked that umber interior. I almost bought one with that color. My Acura dealer mentioned that whenever they have those cars with that interior color, they were hard to sell. So, I figured (rightfully or wrongfully) that the umber might ding it come resell time.Mine had ""stone"" interior, which I liked quite a bit, too. "
"graphicguy","October 2011"," me...I have ""park distance control"" (PDC)on my 3. I like it....more than I liked the back-up camera on my TL. I can get within 12-18 inches of another car or garage wall just by watching the park distance control in the NAV screen.It was harder to judge distance with the back up camera.I'm certain you have to have BMW's iDrive to get PDC. But, I've never seen an option to add it as a dealer accessory. Call your dealer and ask them. "

"me0000","October 2011"," Ok, so I have narrowed down to either the 328iX Premium Nav or the TSX 4 cylinder Tech.

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The BMW would get my vote (and my money).

The AWD on the BMW would sell me, though. "

"flightnurse","October 2011"," I would go for the BMW, for two main reason first the Free maintenance and bumper to bumper warranty for 4yr/50K. Second better resale value, sooner or later you will get a new car, the BMW will hold its value.Why are you looking at the TSX if AWD is important to you? "
"tlong","October 2011"," IMHO you buy the BMW if you want a driving experience, vault-like feel of the car, and brand cachet.You buy the TSX if you like electronic goodies, decent handling, and outstanding reliability.In the BMW you give up great reliability, and if you keep it longer than the warranty period you are looking at very expensive repairs when they are needed.In the Acura you give up the German driving feel and vault-like construction.In my own experience (Audi vs. Acrua), when I had the Audi I found its reliability and service frustrating, but LOVED the driving feel and interior quality. Now with the Acura, I love the reliability and smooth cruising, but really miss the German car quality and driving.Whichever one I had, I wanted the features that the other one had. :surprise: "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," I would say the 328 gives up nothing to the TSX as far as reliability goes. The E90 3 series platform has been around since 2005. My Mom had an '08 328xi that never went into the shop for anything other than scheduled maintenance. Yes she had to put brakes on at 50,100 miles & pay for an Inspection II @ 58,000 miles, but nothing ever broke.In my experience, you CANNOT compare Audi & BMW when it comes to maintenance & repairs. I'm not saying BMWs are perfect, they've had problems with the N54 Twin Turbo "
"andres3","October 2011"," My view on BMW 3 series is that if you can't spring for the good one (335ix) then get the TSX/TL, G35, A4, or whoever else your looking at. Acura's have great resale value as well, not far from BMW, so that's almost a nonfactor.If you are planning on keeping it a long time, I'd bet on the Acura costing you a lot less in both maintenance and repairs. "
"andres3","October 2011"," In my experience, you CANNOT compare Audi & BMW when it comes to maintenance & repairs. I'm not saying BMWs are perfect, they've had problems with the N54 Twin Turbo I've heard a lot more anecdotal evidence that is BAD for BMW reliability in the last 5-7 years than I have for Audi. That being said, if you maintain either properly, you should have a fairly reliable car by any standard (and it helps if you avoid lots of add-on options, as those tend to be the trouble spots). My Audi has been relatively reliable for the 83,000 miles I've driven it since 2006. Perfect no, bothersome, no. If your looking for bulletproof NEVER have to take it back to the dealer, the answer is Acura more often than not. "

You consider a 328i a ""Bad"" BMW? Geez, silly me; I'm thinking a 328i (or better yet the 2.0 liter turbo F30 model which is slated to be the 328i replacement) is pretty much the perfect BMW for me. Why? Given that my 2002 530i SP 5-Speed was so close to absolutely perfect for my needs, wants, and desires, and given that the E90 and the F30 are almost spot on in every metric, but with a bit more leg room, a tad more power and slightly less weight, the ""Bad"" 3-Series couldn't be more ""Gooder"" for me (unless we&#146;re blessed with something like a 6-Speed manual 325d on this side of the pond).  "
"nyccarguy","October 2011"," Even the heaviest 328xi (AWD & Automatic) is a very entertaining car to drive. I agree 100% with shipo's comments.

"2233","October 2011"," Acuras in general are not bulletproof.

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," This thread is more than a tad interesting since I, for one and apparently MORE than one, seem to find some surprise that the TSX and a 3 series BMW (even though it is the ""bad"" one) merit cross-shopping.The TL SH-AWD seems like the obvious choice to cross shop an AWD BMW 3 series with, assuming one must cross shop an Acura and a BMW.But, of the choices offered up in this thread, I would find the Audi 2.0T quattro with the pre-paid maintenance (or perhaps the Volvo S60 T6) to be even more of an apples-to-apples comparison worthy of cross-shopping. Then I look at my recent purchase of a TL, after 29 Audis in a row, and knowing what I cross shopped, well maybe I see the rationale of shopping for both a BMW 3 X-drive and a TL SH-AWD (but never a TSX.)Having had three AWD BMW's since 1988 (in addition to the 29 Audi's), there is no comparison between the BMW and the TSX in terms of the ""feel-behind-the-wheel"" -- and, moreover, in winter, four driven wheels are much better than two, even if those two are the fronts.Although not comparable to the BMW in terms of the ""ultimate driving experience"" the TL SH-AWD does a better imitation of an Audi A4 2.0T quattro Prestige than any other Japanese car I test drove. In fact the TL SH-AWD Advance (which adds 19"" wheels and tires) actually felt pretty competent compared with an 2011 Audi S4 Premium+.Given the two choices you offered up for us to weigh in on, the TSX is only comparable to the BMW in that they both have four wheels -- the BMW is THAT much better. :confuse: "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," Please point me in the direction for proof of your comment about the tranny problems on the TL and MDX's. I have never owned a TL or MDX, but have friends who have/had and not one had a transmission problem. "

"m6user","October 2011"," People purchase cars for different reasons and just because they want a somewhat sporty sedan they may not NEED or even want the greatest ""feel behind the wheel"". They may be shopping price and size as the most important factors on their heiracrchy of needs. The TSX is a lot more similar in size/weight to the 3 than the TL is. They may want good winter traction but not neccesarily the best. While front wheel drive isn't quite as good as all wheel drive is pretty adequate especially if you use snow tires in the winter. Stepping up to the TL SH-AWD is also quite a jump in price from the TX. About 10K or so and about 3K more than the 3ix. The TL SH-AWD is also about 500 lbs heavier than the TSX. The TL is 16"" longer than the BMW....that is a lot. While it may not drive that much heavier it is still a much larger car and many people just don't want that much metal to manuever around. I like the G37 but would get it in ""X"" form because of winter traction. If I bought a TL, the front wheel drive would be adequate without having to jump up in price. Don't really care about the extra HP or being able to take hairpins at speed. Your car buying criteria may be different than others looking at the same class of auto....nothing wrong with that. So it is not wrong to cross shop the TSX with the BMW 3, it is completely right for many people.By the way, I enjoyed your suggestions for improvement over on the 2012 TL thread. Very in depth on the pros and cons. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," Thanks for the compliment -- it is just that Acura seems SOOOO CLOSE to producing really interesting cars, close but not quite there yet. Acura is now, in my ""often wrong, never uncertain"" opinion, where Volvo was a very few years ago. Then the S60 comes along and Acura slips to where Volvo used to be -- no interesting cars, just very good ones that are probably about as reliable and durable as humans know how to build (at these prices.)I could not advise anyone to choose the TSX over the 3 X-drive, the differences are not subtle.But again, I come from the viewpoint: often wrong, but NEVER uncertain.Drive it like YOU live, not like I live!!! :shades: "

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have been trying to say this -- thanks. The price of the 328 X-Drive (if not the dimensions) is competitive with the 328 or the Audi A4. I configured both an Audi A4 2.0T Prestige with the sport package, added wood and sunshades and found the A4 and the Tl SH-AWD Advance (plus back up sensors) to both be about $47,000. A similar exercise with the 328 X-Drive equipped as close as possible to the TL coughs up similar numbers. Not so with the TSX and the 3 comparo.Now having finally gotten this data point out, the only merit in considering the TSX is if ""low price"" is #1 on the criteria list. "

This is a public forum and Edmunds decided to include the TSX in this discussion and if you want to change it why don't you become a host.You say the TSX doesn't belong because it is 4cyl, fwd and bloated. Well the A4 is 4cyl, fwd and about exactly the same price in base form and and is almost exactly the same size but actually weighs more than the TSX. Who is bloated? Just because you can get it in quattro means little. For the same price you can get the TSX w/ a V6(not all that great IMO but doable) and blow the doors off the A4.So I guess if the TSX has to go so should the A4. "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," is this was 2002 when this forum started sure the TSX was right to be included-- but in looking at the group now (its 2012) the TSX has added nothing in terms of power and have added weight... Sure you can get a V6 but how many people are buying this car with the 6? Zero why?? well the price advantage goes away, not to mention its sportier nature with the additional weight, and to say the tsx v6 would blow away the audi doyou know the audi has more torque then the tsx v6?? you and edmunds were right about 10 years ago, but not today, sorry man "

"me0000","October 2011"," I have to agree that the TSX belongs here. i just bought the 328iX over the TSX but it was a very close call. Yes, the cost differential weighed in the TSX's favor but that was not the only factor in its favor. Comparing ""luxury sedans"", features were also factors and, at present, the TSX has some features the 328 doesnt just as the 328 has some the TSX lacks. While I expect the 2012 328 to cover the some of the feature gaps at a higher cost, the TSX deserves due consideration. It's a great vehicle. In the end, after considering the Mercedes C, a couple of Lexus sedans, the 328, and the TSX, I narrowed it down to the TSX and the 328. Unfortunately for Audi and Volvo, I considered neither because of dealer location and reputation. Thanks to all for your thoughts and feedback. Despite my opinions, I respect those that say the TSX doesn't belong here. In my humble opinion, however, I believe it does.Now, however, I am looking forward to the arrival of my 328iX. "

But, sure, go ahead keep it here as an outlier.  "

"flightnurse","October 2011"," Reason why the S60 isn't talked about much is the fact the car redesign makes a statement in style, some people might not think of it as a contender. However this is changing, and soon it will be talked about. For me when I looked at buying my 328 I looked at Volvo on the same night I looked at the A4. The interior space on the S60 seemed smaller then the A4 for more money. Also the car isnt that sporty even in sport trim. "

What this means, and I'm shocked that long time posters don't know this, is that there are other cars not listed that can and probably should be included in discussions. The host can correct me if I'm wrong.So the S60 certainly can be included in the discussion IMO as well as the 9-5(at least for now???) and possibly others.And of course I know the A4 has more torque. Some family sedans have more torque than the A4 so I hardly think that should be the only qualifier. "

"Kirstie_H","October 2011"," That's exactly the issue - limited space. I believe at the time, models were chosen based on the higher-volume sellers or those for which we see the most consumer traffic/interest in the forums. The list isn't meant to be all-inclusive or limiting regarding what vehicles you can discuss - as long as the vehicle reasonably fits into the ELLPS class, it's fine to talk about.Looking at the list, it seems we could replace the Mercedes C-Class with the Volvo S60. It *has* been updated - I remember taking out the G35 and replacing it with the G37. "
"m6user","October 2011"," True or they could even replace the TSX as they already have the TL listed from Acura. That would satisfy all the people that seem to have a hang up with the TSX(they wouldn't see it displayed) but we can still discuss as a viable alternative. All these cars don't have to perform exactly alike or be priced the same to be in the same class. There always has to be a starting point in any category and I would suggest the TSX is that starting point. Is it as fast, handle as well, etc etc as many of the others? No, but it still belongs in the mix. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," I would rather see the S60 take the place of one of the Lexus sedans. They are much more redundant than the TSX and TL. "
"Kirstie_H","October 2011"," I agree - no sense in listing two very similar models. Most of our discussions across the forums about the IS250/IS350 are combined anyway, and it's not that much of a high-traffic model. "
"m6user","October 2011"," I have no vested interest so I don't care much which cars are mentioned in the heading. I fail to see the big deal in all of this.

"renssils","October 2011"," After driving my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD with Advance package and automatic transmission for 8,000 miles, I can make a few observations. The car has been reliable, though lately it rattles, perhaps from the sunroof. The seats are comfortable. The HVAC and in-car electronics are excellent. On the highway it gets about 27 miles a gallon; in town, about 17 miles a gallon. The engine and transmission are both quiet and smooth.Within 250 miles of my getting the TL at the end of April 2011, I bought a set of four Continental ContiExtreme DW summer tires, which are so much better than the OEM Goodyear tires. The TL on the Conti tires is fun to drive! The Contis stick like glue, are quieter, and smoother riding. Today in anticipation of winter, the Goodyears were installed on the TL; the Contis will be stored until next April. I will miss the Contis. I recall that the Goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. I hope that they'll perform well in shallow snow.I've owned several high-performance all-wheel-drive sedans including a 2001 Audi A6 4.2 sport, a Subaru SVX, which is my all-time favorite, and two Subaru Legacy spec.B sedans. I was inclined to get a new Audi S4, but chose the TL after driving a BMW 535ix, Volvo S60 T6, and Infiniti M37x. The TL seemed to be the best all-around vehicle. The TL was appreciably less costly to lease than the other cars. The TL delights in many ways, but disappoints in some ways. The forward visibility is atrocious. Thick, raked A-pillars create huge blind spots; turning left or right always seems risky. Rear visibility is severely limited. The back up camera has primitive software and furthermore rain on the camera's lens reduces its utility. The trunk is oddly shaped and small for a 194-inch long car; if you don't lift the trunk deck as high as it will go, its pointed bottom lip will stab you. The only clock is an inch-long digital display buried in a panel near the radio buttons. The navigation system's system has irritating quirks that should have debugged long ago. The car would benefit from a reduction in window and road noise.The TL is so close to being a fine car, but I wouldn't buy it or any car ever again with small windows, high belt line, and atrocious visibility. "
"robbieg","October 2011"," I would think that in the real world few people actaully want a ""performance car"". Most people want a slush box and not a stick. Furthermore, at least in my next of the woods, people don't want a RWD BMW or Mercedes. They want AWD so it goes in the snow. In short, performance isn't that big of a deal. The TSX is every bit as sporty as a CTS or the S60 if not more so. It seems people in this forum, which I have read on and off for years, care about a manual transmission and rear wheel drive. Well, few if any of those cars are sold in my area. Most BMWs are x-drive and with only a few manuals are actually sold. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I'll agree the TSX belongs. If only for it's quality interior appointments and exacting assembly from Japanese artisans. I found it to be ""tighter"" than the USA built TL a few years back (previous generation models). I had a 2003 Accord V6 and it's interior was best in class in my opinion, but the TSX clearly goes beyond anything Honda has or had in luxuriousness of the interior. I haven't driven a TSX so I can't speak on that, but I'm very familiar with the way Honda's drive, and would say that Honda/Acura have mastered the art of sporty FWD cars. FWD can be great when engineered correctly for sport and performance.I currently drive a FWD Audi A3, and can say that Honda/Acura/Audi/VW are in their own league when it comes to sporty FWD performance.I don't think anyone can touch them on Front Trak/FWD. If your goal is to be fast, FWD can work. If your goal is to do powerslides and drift, FWD is a problem.I think in the future I will prefer AWD. Absent the weight penalty, AWD rocks. "

I bought my car in November of 2008, two days before a light dusting of snow, and the RS-As proved to be as bad in the snow as the Michelin Pilot Primacys which came on my last BMW (with the Sport Package which features summer tires).Fortunately I'd been forewarned about the RS-As and already had a set of Pilot Sport A/Ss on order, and once they were installed after 714 miles, I sold the (virtually new) Goodyears for something like thirty cents on the dollar (and was happy to get that much for them).

"sweendogy","October 2011"," mark - good post-- something ive been saying for years- the acura line as we know it has not life and needs to be revived. Its been past by both lexus (luxury) and infiniti (sport) and no where near the germans. Where is the NSX, the integra, or the legend.. Cars are recycled from the parent acura line, like oldsmobile used to do with chevy cars.. olds no longer exists -for good reason. Acura needs to get the game back on, i agree, where is the passion for driving.sure they build a nice sedan that will last 10 years but.. sorry boys with the TSX and the TL's-- your cars are fine autos but not sports sedans.. (HOSTS its time for a change to this category, i mean its been 10 years, get rid of the TSX, keep the boring TL and add a Volvo, i mean do the math ELLPS its in the price range, produces more power, has awd and has been talked about for months-its 2012 not 2002) "
"sweendogy","October 2011"," why not say this a year ago when it was first mentioned ? I mean its been pretty well know by all the TSX should be moved lower in the class due to the fact that it has less power, is fwd, and has never been mentioned by magazines that we all read as being a player in the group?- the posters of the blog should be heard.. "
"tlong","October 2011"," ... the posters of the blog should be heard.Personally, I've seen it repeated many times that the TSX belongs in this discussion, yet SOME poster just can't let that lie.....I wonder why? Nobody is forcing anybody to buy the car. :surprise: "

"andres3","October 2011"," I will say that there was an Integra at the track, and it kept up with me in my A3 (with some mods too) and I'm a pretty fast student driver.Of course, I let him pass once, and then he proceeded to spin out and get about 6"" deep in the dirt n' gravel on the very next turn as I stayed right behind him, but for a lap or two, he stayed with me.Didn't Edmund's Inside Line recently show a ten year old RSX ran circles around a 2010 Civic Si.Haven't seen a TL or TSX at the track yet.

"andres3","October 2011"," test drive. I'm talking a serious test drive where you can really drive the car, probably to the point where most car salesman wouldn't want to go along for the ride? "
"qbrozen","October 2011"," Just tell them that's what you want to do. Explain you need to take it out for probably an hour or more so you can be sure. Doubt a salesman will want to spend an hour riding along with you.If they do insist on going along, I go ahead and do what I would do as if they weren't there. It is their own damned fault. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have found that LPS and ELLPS car dealer salesreps virtually never go along for the test drive -- assuming the car you show up with at the dealership is already in the same class or that the car is at least fairly new and you don't look like something the cat dragged in.If you show up at the dealership with your significant other, too, I can bump that up to ""the salesrep NEVER goes along for the ride."" Now, one thing they do, if you are a stranger to the dealership, is photocopy your driver's license.On the other hand, if you go into a Ford dealership (not picking on Ford), to drive a new Taurus, they ALWAYS go on the ride with you, ditto with Honda, Mazda and VW, to name a few.Since it has never happened -- the salesrep ride along -- with this class of car, I usually take a long test drive (about 1 CD's worth) and then almost immediately go onto the next car I am considering and repeat the same test drive (over the same roads, route, etc.) also for about 1 CD (the same CD, natch.)My wife and I have a routine for testing that permits about three (maybe four) cars to be tested back to back to back (to back) in one day (Saturday or Sunday if possible.) This most recent time we used the video capture feature of an iPhone 4G and she recorded my reactions while I drove and I recorded hers, etc -- as we drove each car over the exact same route, speeds, etc, etc. Afterwards we compared our instantaneous reactions as first I drove an Audi, then a Cadillac then an Acura (ditto her.)Frankly, and I know many here will argue that I must have been on something, we drove an Audi S4 Premium Plus, a CTS-4 Sport Luxury (with 19"" sport package) and an Acura TL SH-AWD Advance back to back to back: we found the S4 and the TL to be twin sons of different mothers they were so close in their capabilities (and the TL was the clear price winner.) The CTS4 was ""very nice"" but seemed to lack the weapons grade torque the other two seemed to have (and I admit the S4 had more, but the difference was not worth the extra premium price, especially considering the fact that the S4 didn't even have nav.)Our test drives include: acceleration runs (to 80+MPH), parking lot (empty) ""slalom runs"" (to test understeer -- be aware this causes motion sickness if you have just eaten), panic braking (with ESP on and off), freeway driving (20+ miles, one way, or so, at least) and secondary road (where there is very low traffic) ""performance"" driving. We listen to the radio (AM, FM and Sat) and the CD. We test for bluetooth pairing with a Blackberry (difficult to do for many cars) and we see how intuitive the voice command/prompt systems are, etc.If you take along some popcorn, you can make a really entertaining day of it -- and come to some rather unanticipated conclusions, too. Take me, for instance -- I thought for certain I would end up with Audi #30 or an Infiniti M37X. Acura wasn't really on my radar. I thought I would end up with a Volvo S60 T6 before I would ever go for a ""butt ugly"" Acura.DOH! :surprise: "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," The 2012 M is gorgeous. And I somewhat disagree about the salesperson going along for the ride.Honda, check. Toyota, check. Ford, no. Lexus, no. Acura, never drove it. BMW, didn't have to drive it.Im now 4 months into my g37 and that vehicle puts a smile on my face. I was going to go for the 335i but the value and sportiness and price point of the g was hard to refuse.I rented both the g and CTS for a week. The week rental of the g is what swayed my decision. The acura didn't do it for me, even though I'm a fan of Honda. Wasn't interested in Audi or Volvo. Es wasn't sporty enough. G is quick when you get on the gas and rides like its on rails. "
"flightnurse","October 2011"," A few years back my partner and I were looking to buy an SUV, we stopped in an Acrua Dealer, talked to the sales guy (no pressure at all) he got a copy of our licenses and handed us the keys a MDX, said, we close at 9pm be back before that (this was at 4pm.) When we came back we talked to the sales guy and bought the MDX (touring with Nav.) It was the best test drive I have ever taken, no pressure whats so ever. We had it for 4 years until we traded it in on a 2009 X5. Is Acura still doing these kind of test drives? "

"andres3","October 2011"," Hmmm, maybe that's why I've never got to do a test drive without the salesman present, whether it was me or my significant other doing the driving and whether or not we were together or I was alone.Of course, I've only purchased a Honda and an Audi A3 new myself. Maybe driving into the Audi dealer with a Honda made them treat me like a VW customer.Do they ever impose mileage restrictions on you? I'd imagine if someone said be back before closing and that gave me 5 hours driving time, you could drive 300 miles easily averaging 60 MPH. I'm thinking 150 miles would be a sufficient test drive. In San Diego, that would be like a drive to Julian and back; which would be perfect to test all of the capabilities properly.I don't necessarily need to be alone, but I think 100 or so miles are needed to make a purchase decision on something over $30K.

"andres3","October 2011"," I'm shocked you found the TL to be every bit the car the S4 was (well, almost). Doesn't the S4 have a 25 or so HP advantage as well over the TL?I'd always imagined the TL would have a much softer Lexus like ride vs. the sport oriented S4. "

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," All I am saying is I drove a 2011 S4 Premium Plus, followed by a 2011 Cadillac CTS/4, followed by a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. My reactions, without price considerations:#1 S4 if it were the Prestige version#2 TL, as is#3 Cadillac -- nice to look at, but too much emphasis on lux, not enough on sportWith price factored in:#1 TL SH-AWD Advance (which includes 19"" wheels and tires)#2 S4 -- but way too much money#3 Cadillac -- nice to look at, but too much emphasis on lux, not enough on sportI ended up choosing a 2012 Audi A4 Prestige w/sport package as my #1 choice since it and the TL were comparbly equipped and priced.Then, being a leasing customer, finding a 42 month lease on the A4 to be over $100 per month higher than the 36 month TL lease, I went with the Acura.The Acura does not blow me away -- but, FOR THE MONEY, the Acura is 8.5/10ths as ""good"" as the S4. The Acura continues to impress me everytime I drive it. I doubt I will have much lust for it -- the Audi seemed like the kind of ride you might consider pawning something for, not so the Acura or Cadillac.I gave the Acura a ""+"" since it is made in North America -- been a long time since I owned (or leased) something primarily ""made in America,""I am NOT trying to convice you to choose the Acura over a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or even over a Volvo S60 T6 or Type-R. I am simply saying someone, once, did a cross comparison of an S4 and a TL and found them to be able to be talked about in the same breath, sentence and paragraph.If someone would have magically lowered the term and monthly lease payment price on the A4 2.0T Prestige, I would propbably be THERE, now.Mean time, I must say one thing for sure, the TL has the best factory sound system I have ever heard. The fact that it handles pretty well and accelerates strong is nothing but gravy. :surprise: "
"andres3","October 2011"," Mean time, I must say one thing for sure, the TL has the best factory sound system I have ever heard.I have heard and read that from many people and sources. Find a DVD-A (DVD Audio disc) and put that in to be truly blown away for sound quality.However, I'm sure your tested S4 didn't have the Bang & Olufsen optional sound system which has garnered some magnificent attention lately for Audi. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," I have about a half a dozen DVD Audio disks, and you are right -- wow! My outgoing 2009 A4 Prestige had the B&O system and it was great, too, but nothing like the Acura ELS system in Dolby PLII or DVD-Audio (or DTS CD's for that matter, too.)I wonder why, in this day and age of BRANDING, that Acura chose not to have a tie in with a name brand sound system? "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," I have the upgraded bose on my G, I played ""the matrix"" and was blown away by the sound quality and separation. B&O though has a very good reputation for making top shelf products.I haven't heard the TLs sound system in person, but I've read on forums those who have and who have heard the G's system, say there are equals. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I don't know. Bose spends more on marketing than on the products.There is a saying, ""No highs, no lows, must be BOSE!""Harmon/Kardon has a better reputation in sound quality, but even they seem to skimp out for BMW installations.I think Acura did the right thing in doing it themselves with no name tied to it, but probably, they did outsource to some company out there that remained nameless, or they hunted and hired some key personnel from one of the sound/speaker companies. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," I guess it depends. I have a number of BOSE products and are very happy with them.We are talking about stock stereo systems. Based on the source I suspect there will be a lot of variability. The only thing is Acura can play dvd-a discs, which, imo is going the way of cassette. It is debateable if there is a real world difference between a DVD-A disc at 96khz and a DVD disc at 48khz. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," My wife has the BOSE upgrade in her 2011 Infinity -- it is very good. But nothing, so far, comes close (OEM) to what is in the Acura (the ELS system, is the one I am speaking of.)The B&O was also very good -- it must be the sub-woofer in the Acura, since music ""feels"" so much more alive in the Acura than either the Audi or the Infiniti.I agree DVD-Audio, good as it is, is about as popular as DIVX. I suspect that this is, once again, caused by ""good being the enemy of great!""I do find this somewhat confusing since Blu-ray seems to be a success and HDTV, too, seems to be the preferred way to watch TV these days.Some of the DVD-Audio disks are truly amazing -- and very scarce.Unfortunately, I end up listening to Sirius-XM most of the time. And, it is truly poor it is so limited in dynamic range and, frankly, fidelity. It is, however, better than most FM stations and being ""never out of signal/range"" is a big plus on those 100 mile commutes between cities I seem to make so often.I had hoped for more from Sat-Radio. But, I must admit I do like the station called Deep Tracks -- and Watercolors is pretty good too. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," Re Acura ELS, that's what I'm saying. I've read a lot of he/she said on how good it is based on what audio source.Have you tried playing a high qualify DVD with 5.1 in the thing? It's sounds amazing.I agree about XM, however and this is a big however, I'll forgo the dynamic range to have the choice of music. 40's on 4, 60's on 6, 70's on 7, watercolors, soul/r&b whatever. I listened to xm when i rented the G in the desert, miles from anything. Loved it. Not to mention I'm loading up the harddrive with all sorts of stuff. "
"andres3","October 2011"," I guess it depends. I have a number of BOSE products and are very happy with them.Have you owned comparable products to the BOSE from other companies at similar price points?It is not debateable whether a regular DVD is as good in sound quality as a DVD-A. It is not only the difference between 96 Khz and 48 khz for the bandwidth but also 16bit vs. 24bit/96Khz. I'll take the Pepsi challenge anyday with my home audio system and I'm positive the differences are noticeable and substantial. I even have a 24-Bit/48 Khz that sounds noticeably better than regular DVD's. However, you are right, SACD and DVD-A killed each other in a double suicide just like the fate of HDDVD.Blu-Ray has SACD/DVD-A audio potential along with HD video capability to go with it, so once cars get Blu-Ray players, DVD-Audio will be obsolete.

"billyperksii","October 2011"," Mark, XM is so yesterday, why pay for the services after the 3 months freebie?Streaming is the way to go these days- Pandora and the list goes on.I like Pandora in particular, it does not loose is connectivity as some of the other sources. "
"andres3","October 2011"," Not to mention that XM and Sirius are guilty of downgrading and compressing the beamed out signals so much that it negates any advantage in technology! "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," The thing is, XM is so easy to use and certain stations (mostly the ones with live announcers, it seems) aren't as badly compressed as others. I like the ability to listen to Deep Tracks for a while then switch to 60's, then classical, then Spa then Watercolors, etc.How would I get Pandora, live, in a moving car, pardon my ignorance? "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," What is debateable and what I was getting at, is can you hear the difference at 65 mph over rough, noisy pavement? Between the two formats. I'll bet not.I'm not talking about a high-end home theater system, I'm talking about wind noise, road noise, rain noise all at once. "
"kdshapiro","October 2011"," That's okay, I understood that going in. I lowered my expectations of sound quality to be able to quickly and easily listen to the music format of my choice. "
"andres3","October 2011"," Ah.. That's fair. I would expect to get top notch bandwidth if I'm going to pay for a service like radio (be it HD or Satellite or whatever). I'm already mad at Cox Cable because I've noticed that not only does HD video just BARELY get enough bandwidth to not pixilate in my neighborhood, but the sound quality coming out of HD channels is far from HD-like. It isn't even digital cable like! And I'm paying them a fortune every month! Something's gonna give soon! "
"andres3","October 2011"," Ahhh... now that makes sense. The car isn't the best medium to listen to music, but is often the one most available time and schedule wise.That being said, higher quality source and output couldn't hurt! It can only help. A Lexus is going to be far quiter at 65 MPH than your typical vehicle over rough noisy pavement, so some cars might fare better than others. Even the type of tires you buy can make a big difference with ""driving"" noise. "
"fedlawman","October 2011"," The recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate.Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" is one of the best sounding discs out there, and it's ""just"" DTS.

The Police ""Every Breath You Take - The Singles"" sounds terrible.Most of the time, I can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a Redbook CD and SACD even when listening carefully with headphones. In a car?!?! Forget about it. The best thing about the Acura sound system is the surround sound. That's definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others.Mark, do you have any Porcupine Tree DVD-A's? You must get some - they will blow you away! "
"billyperksii","October 2011"," Mark:I am guessing you have about twenty years on me (I am seventies baby) If you have the internet on your smartphone- all you need to do is go to the Pandora site and create an account (free with limited commercilas- upgrades are available), you create your own stations (artist, songs, era etc etc ) and just sync it to the bluetooth feature in the car- Its that simple- I find it good for long trips with the kids, they create their stations we hit the road and they enjoy the ride.

"kdshapiro","October 2011"," I can stream pandora, nobex, iheartradio from my blackberry through my car's speakers, but why? I have much more variety on XM, it sounds better, and doesn't cost that much.If one is going to plunk down $40+ for a TL or G37 and pay expensive dealer maintenance(at least Acura, I'll find out about Infiniti, first two services are free) and put premium in the car, then what is another $150/year for an XM subscription.

"billyperksii","October 2011"," I was with XM for several years then they came out with this Royalty Fees which I think was presumptuous for them to pass on to the customers-thats why I left.I find streaming to be the future of radio listening- who wants to pay to listen to the radio- I know I dont, considering the multiple FREE options available.Secondly, the streaming sound quality is above average through the Acura speakers- cannot attest to the Bose.

You must get some - they will blow you away!Trying to remember who told me, but from a reliable source.......the ELS sound system in the TL-Tech is made by Pioneer. Why they don't brand it, I really don't know. It might be Acura's choice. I know for awhile, Acura was using car systems by Clarion, but the current ones that come with the tech packages (not sure about the source for their standard stereos) are from Pioneer.Long and short of it, I think Acura used to use Bose, and advertised that they did (requirement from Bose, perhaps?). But, that was several years ago. Since then, they never advertise who makes their car stereos (same for Honda).It's still the best car sound system I've ever listened to. That includes the HK system in my 335i (which is no slouch) and the B&O systems I heard in the Audis I test drove.BTW...agreed on Porcupine Tree. Also see if you can find the DVD-A disk from Dishwalla called Opaline. Don't get the ""dual disk"" one, but the DVD-A version.YES-Fragile is probably the best DVD-A I've ever heard.Too bad that format never really took hold.

I drove it for a while while my Malibu Hybrid (don't laugh, I didn't choose it...LOL!) was at the shop for a battery recall.

One of the benefits of SACD and DVD-A was supposed to be that it was either scratch resistant or almost immune to sensitivity from minor scratches. They are supposed to be quite durable. So far, I have none that cause any skipping issues, but then again, I have not seen any DVD-A or SACD systems sold for vehicles yet (other than factory Acura system).Are these disks really irreplaceable?

Like the way the new sport model looks - hope they hold pricing to 2011 levels. The 4 cyl is an interesting option - I mean if they can get the performance of the current 328 - with highway Mpgs in the low to mid 30's it will be very interesting- plus it still a rwd platform so turns will continue to be fun. A hybrid will prob be in tenge near future as well. Nice to see the leader continuing to evolve - this should make Infiniti react - this could get interesting "
"carnaught","November 2011"," By ""new"", do you mean the new body style (VanHooydonk designed, rather than Bangle) ? "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," I saw that last night, the new turbo 4 is an interesting engine, in the Z4 the turbo 4 s faster then the 3 liter, so hopefully the new 3 will faster too. I like the interior of the sport model, so far one can not build the new car until it is showed at the LA auto show. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Yes its a whole new car... "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," I really liked the looks of the new 3. The specs for the turbo 4 should up the ante quite nicely in the performance arena. Making about 260 hp should put the 328 in a whole new ballgame. While it may not be the speed demon of the 335, it should hold it's own against some of the other midsize sedans that offer in the mid-250s hp. "
"shipo","November 2011"," From my perspective, the horsepower race has gotten out of hand and now even the lowest power 3-Series is more than powerful enough even if other similar sized vehicles offer more power for less money.To underscore that point, my 2002 530i 5-Speed was just about as perfect a car for my needs, wants, and desires from a size, power, feature, and performance perspective as there could ever be, and the new 3-Series will (or should) have a tad more space inside, weigh about the same, have considerably more power, perform even better, get better fuel economy, and cost less. Could it be that the new 328i 6-Speed with the 2.0 liter blown mill will be even more perfecter for me than my 5er? From everything I've seen and read about the F30, it definitely looks like that may be the case. :shades: "

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," Our first and only Infiniti, thus far, is a 2011. I cannot speak to or about what has gone before. Between my wife and I, we have had 29 Audis, 3 VW's 3 BMW's, 1 Infiniti and 1 Acura. I would say based on our ownership experiences and our many, many test drives, that your comment about Infiniti's mission statement has to be based on something you read (but not much) or some personal experience (?) you may have had sometime in the past -- or else you're just poking the fire for whatever reason.I would say, at this point in my experience, that Infiniti is the Japanese BMW (praise for the Infiniti, that is) and that Acura is the Japanese Audi (praise primarily for Acura but actually some praise back at Audi, too.)Courser engines? Well, at their RPM limits, Infiniti engines are not quite up to the BMW reputation of silky smoothness, but I would not think this is part of any kind of a mission statement. As to the comment jerky rides -- I will simply have to write that off as most likely coming from a position of ignorance or confusion. :confuse: "
"shipo","November 2011"," While I agree that the ""gotta have it"" crowd buys a car for its specifications as written, some of us still buy a car for how well it fits the mission we're buying it for. When I bought my 530i it was the first time in my life I didn't opt for the largest/most powerful engine available for the model I was buying. I considered a 540i 6-Speed, but given how powerful and balanced the 530i was, I just couldn't justify the extra $8,000 (apples to apples).Given that the F30 328i will weigh roughly 200 pounds less than my E39 530i, have (depending upon the source) anywhere from 20 to 40 more horsepower and 45 to 60 more pound-feet of torque, one might make the case that the F30 328i will be able to give an E39 540i 6-Speed a run for its money. In my mind, other than the paper specifications of the 328i and 335i versus the competition, the new baby 3er is, if anything, too powerful (not that I'm going to complain mind you). "

"billyperksii","November 2011"," The point I was trying to make is- Infiniti is spending so much time chasing BMW that they are getting left behind in the dust. Secondly, I base my buying on my own experience with the car and the features that fits my needs. Not like the gullible ones that goes by what some magazine articles states. I say this all the time, back in 2000 when I graduated college, I got a decent job in a brokerage shop making a relatively good salary. I wanted a car and saw the Mazda Millennia, every research I did gave the car thumbs down. Me and my infinite wisdom test drove the car for about 2 hours- car was incredible and gave zero problems for the 36 months that I leased it.I have no problems with Infiniti, I wanted the FX when they first came out, I went the NYC auto show to check it out and it was a big disappointment in terms of rear space accommodations. I wanted the G35x, same problem-space and in addition that awful growl that invades the cabin.The TL has been very very good in the 27 months of ownership, the next stop for me are the Germans-if Acura upgrades the RL to a V8, I will stick with the brand. Here is the short list for next car hunt-E550 4maticE63 (Depends on the bonus and incremental base pay increase)550 XIWhat do you think SWEENYDOG????? "
"graphicguy","November 2011"," fedlawman...glad you enjoyed ""Opaline"". It's one of my faves....especially in surround.While the weather is still nice (high 60s....in November, no less), I'm going to have to do a ""get ready for winter"" detail. Of course, now that the time change occurred, I'm hoping the weather holds out for the weekend, since it's too dark to do after work.After 4K miles, I'm averaging 23.4 MPG in my 335i xDrive. Pretty darn good. I'm pleased. "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I too have my copy of Opaline DVD-A. I like it A LOT. It reminds me of a mash-up of sounds from a couple of other groups, dominated by a kind of Hootie and the Blowfish sound but with a touch more of an acoustic mood.Hard to beat for the price and in the TL it is a tasty treat of tunage!Try some of the DTS offerings, if you get a chance -- also quite a treat, usually. "
"kdshapiro","November 2011"," Having just bought a G37, I spent a week with it on a trip. I'm not impressed with Acura TL, they have not really moved forward in few years. And while I did a boat load of driving and looking, my wife and I were on the same page regarding the Acura, just no interest.The cabin was too big for me along with the turning radius.The G37 is a very compelling package. A fully loaded car, except the tech package cost me what a basic 335 would have been. (The 2012 M is really sweet and the M hybrid is gorgeous.) Does BMW fulfill it's mission better, yep. Would I rather be driving a 550 yep or even a 335, yep. But there are always compromises in life. "
"fedlawman","November 2011"," I like the quieter tracks best. I love ""Today/Tonight,"" ""Candleburn,"" and ""Drawn Out."" Great songs with simply stunning sound! A couple of the louder tracks sound a little compressed/congested in places when I play them at volume.Mark - I hear some U2 and Coldplay in this album.The weather already sucks here and my M is in semi-hibernation now (battery tender all week long). That's surprisingly good fuel economy - neither of my cars (Volvo and BMW - both with significantly smaller & less powerful engines) do as well. "
"graphicguy","November 2011","  fed....mark.....glad you like my recommendations. ""Today/Tonight"" is one of my favorite tracks, too. About 3 years ago, DTS was selling their own surround music disks on their own WEB site. I suspect they were getting out of the surround music biz in favor of the more popular (and more volume) DTS HD movie blu ray disks. Some interesting titles. Haven't listened to them in a while. Don't know if they're out of print or not. Have to dig them out.My MPG is at 50-50 city/interstate. When I'm all interstate, it bumps up to about 28 MPG. All city driving is about 20-21 MPG. Pleased with all of it. Turbo 6 cyl, gobs of torque, no turbo lag, I'm liking it.I still have to wonder how the BMW faithful will react to 4 cyl motors in the 2012 vs what has been years and years of 6 cyl offerings. I've read and heard of how ""wonderful"" the new 4 cyl engines are supposed to be. However, I don't know of anyone who's driven one yet (including the trade rags). "
"fedlawman","November 2011"," I have to admit that the I-6 is intoxicating. I love the turbine-smooth power and sound it makes. It's one of the things I miss the most about my old 325i. I'm sure the new 4 will be smooth, but I doubt if it will match the refinement of the I-6. On the other hand, it will no doubt be much smoother and more refined than the I-4 and I-5 I currently own.I'm going to have to research those DTS discs... "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," To each his own- I say the opposite, TL over the G.Secondly, what do you mean Acura has not moved forward in a few years. Tell me what's so advanced on the G that the TL does not have mechanically and technologically? I am really baffled on this satement. "

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I wanted (and still do) an Infiniti product. I love my wife's '11 FX35 Premium (in black with the Java interior) -- but, I didn't want to have 2 of the same thing and I absolutely had to have blind spot indication (coming from my '09 Audi A4 Prestige where it was standard equipment.) The only Infiniti that I could get that had BSI was the M and I had to order an M with BOTH Premium and Technology packages to get the BSI (and the tech package seemed to contain expensive automatic cruise control hardware and software that I did not see -- at this time anyway -- the value in.) I also shopped for a new A6, but the lease rates and the discounts offered were breathtaking (and not in a good way)!So, I test drove the G37X with EVERYTHING on it and found it to be great fun to drive and with acceptable levels of sport and lux -- and the lease prices were fantastic. Yet, the G could not be had with BSI -- and it seems (and is) a narrow vehicle, both in the interior width and the track. The G has a track of 60.2"" and the TL is 63.8"" -- you can feel the difference; and to me the difference made the TL feel more stable and nimble (almost like my outgoing 2009 A4.)I probably would have gone with the G, despite the above, had it offered BSI.Another contender was the Volvo T6 which could be had with BSI and felt even quicker with its ""right now"" torque, thanks to the turbo.As someone said, to each his/her own -- the G just seemed cramped inside and somehow, compared to what I was used to, made me feel like I was a bug when I took it out on the Interstate (full of semi's).Drive it like you live. :shades: "

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," Didn't forget them at all . . . just thought my [subjective] point had been made. Hell, I grew up where only rich people's cars had A/C and power windows. My dad got a new Plymouth in 1969 with power steering -- but no power brakes. And even though it was the top of the line Plymouth Satellite with a 318 V8 (the 383 and Hemi were reserved for the Road Runner and the 440 was for the GTX), it didn't have factory air -- so my dad had the dealer install aftermarket A/C which meant the front bench seat could only seat two instead of three because of the ""device"" (the blowing unit) that was installed that stuck way out into the passenger area.The first time I got a car with power steering, brakes AND windows, I knew I had become a member of ""the club."" That car was a 1976 Chrysler Cordoba with fine Corithian Leather (how many remember that reference?)It still had an AM only radio though, but with a speaker in the rear deck it was ""upscale"" befitting someone of my stature (in ""the club,"" of course.)And, man o' man, when I got a car that had a rear window defroster (which was a slit in the rear deck through which air was blown by a motor located in the trunk), well, peel me a grape, Mabel. Power door locks engendered a similar reaction when I got a 4-door car with FRONT only power door locks (and, as I recall, FRONT only power windows, too.) The dome light only came on when you opened a FRONT door, on this car -- probably saved $.50 per door to omit the rear on/off switch.When I got an Audi with an infra-red remote (who's dumbass idea was THAT, anyway? -- infra-red, geesh) -- I had another grape peeling moment as well.These days its power everything on virtually every car -- and even if you didn't want these assists, well, it would be virtually impossible to NOT have them.My 1978 Audi 5000 was my first car with heated seats -- I used to take people for rides in the car and secretly turn on the seat heaters. . .why? Because back then heated seats were rare (and novel.)I also didn't forget articulating headlights, nor did I forget bi-xenons (which the Acura TL lacks, strangely.)Memories. . .memories. . . . :blush: "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," You may be right about your longevity concern -- I really don't know. What I have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when ""the light changes"" will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.Perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- I would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter MOTOR?In any case, I assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.Somewhere I read that there is a patent on a technology that ""warms up"" the transmission when the car is started COLD; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more MPG's, and, over the life of the car, this ""bit more"" adds up. It is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of cars and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)Fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell I watch too much TV) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of cars, these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)Mostly (which is NOT the same as entirely) I am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of ""older"" technologies to make them ""better"" (and greener, too, if possible). When a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, I am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward. :surprise: "

"shipo","November 2011"," Regarding the whole Start/Stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, I don't think it will affect engine longevity at all. Why? Because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.Other fuel economy related thoughts:I find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if I might be so bold, highly questionable. From my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle. I'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power assist pumps, the A/C compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).Remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. The only company which has announced such a research project is BMW; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later. "
"graphicguy","November 2011"," I know there was quite a stir when the Hyundai Genesis came out. Don't know if it fits in this discussion, but I actually had test driven one when they first came out. Nice ""first"" effort at a lux car by Hyundai (they really should change their name for cars sold in the U.S.).Well, I got my first chance to drive one for an extensive period of time. It was a rental (Enterprise). It was the 6 cyl model with what looked like the middle of the options package (everything but Nav).First, it's a BIG car.It drove fine....actually, it drove pretty good. I was in Milwaukee (OshKosh) WI with it when it snowed for the first time this Fall. It handled the snow and slush just fine. The suspension that everyone bitched about isn't bad...at least not as bad as I had read about here at Edmunds. Yes, there are some road surfaces that cause an unrefined chassis feeling, but for the most part, it was fine....similar to a Mercedes E, without the unrefined part. There were some things where hitting their price point caused some short cuts. If that's real wood in the cabin, the trees they used must have been very sick. The seats are....well....they're wide....certainly not very comfortable (and on the opposite end of the seats you'd find in the TL SH AWD or my 335i....both are great). The lighting is superb in the cabin.They spend the money on the drivetrain, you can tell. The engine is responsive and sounds uber refined. The transmission shifts seamlessly and is ready to kick down when needed.All the switches feel richer than they should, and operate with a smoothness that was unexpected.All-in-all a nice first effort. Came close to mimicking the A6, Mercedes E, Lexus LS, (not really in the same category as a BMW 5 from both a dynamic and performance category). Not quite hit the nail on the head, but relatively close for a lot less money. "

"flightnurse","November 2011"," First off attacking what a person drives is the first sign of a weak debater. The Mileneum at the time was a great car, it was to have been part of the Upper Division that mazda was going introduce (Think Acrua, Infiniti and Lexus) however Mazda has $$ problems so the 929 and Mileneum never got the support from Mazda. Which is too bad since the triple rotor Cosmos would have came here to the states.The G25 is a great car however it needs more HP, since the entry level 3 series makes more HP then G25. The G37 is no costing very close to that of the 335i when it comes to a few thousand dollars which adds only $10-30/m to payments why get the G37? The engine in the G37 isn't as smooth as the G35 was, or as smooth as the BMW. With the sport package the 3 series is a better handler.BUT it all depends on what the buyer wants, Would I like a 400hp 3 series, YES, but I'm not willing to pay entry fee into the world of the M3.

The allroad was part station wagon (the cool part?), great CAR-LIKE attributes and it could go light off-roading.It failed (in the US at least).It is often a matter of showing the mfgr the money.This is my concern about Acura.

Imagine if you had to go to the dealership with a check for the car in full - your BMW 328 would be as common as a Mazda mulenium. "
"dino001","November 2011"," You didn't undestand the actual comments:1. Putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage (which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company). If car gets totalled, the downpayment is gone, gone, gone, whereas if you put nothing down, GAP (included in lease) will pick it up. Other advantages are businesses don't need to commit capital and get better tax treatment (not really applicable for consumer). That's why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way - they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads. Doesn't mean that one has to go for it - quite to contrary, it's generally bad idea, period.2. People who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease, which means they should not lease. Lease is much more complex financing instrument with more variables that can be manipulated to create illusion of lower price. There are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing - but not because of lower payment, but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value (after return, the manufacturer's bank has to eat the price difference). One who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it, otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term, when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches. All of that has to be factored in. That's why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment, most likely they can't afford the car (""don't deserve""). It really is a simple rule of thumb - if you can't afford to buy it (loan/cash), you can't afford to lease it, either. There are some exceptions for very low mileage users, or subsidized leases, but just because monthly payment is lower, it doens't mean it's cheaper.I went through it with my recent purchase. I got 328 wagon with a few options ($45K MSRP). Correctly structured lease (0 down, 15K/yr) was about $200 per month less than 60 month loan with small ($2500) downpayment (yes - loan downpayments are making perfect sense, as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total). To me $200 per month is absolutely not enough, especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan. I made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal. Higher monthly payments, but better deal overall. Now, if somebody lives in monthly payment world, they may not really understand the concept, but that's a different discussion.  "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Go to the Infiniti dealer and ask to see the car that is advertise for that lease price. Changes are there isn't one around.. Leader Ad... We can agree to disagree, you can put down $4K on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you can't really afford. I'll use BMW's money and put nothing down on a lease and use my $4K for my trip to Germany when we do the European Delivery of our 2012 535i "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Thank you setting the record straight, there is also another factor that goes into leasing, is someone credit score, if you have less then 720 mid score forget about getting the best rate on a lease these days, it wont happen.

"smarty666","November 2011"," Leasing really was a great alternative 5-6 years ago and I used to do it, but since then, the car companies have gotten greedy and over value the residuals and make it impossible to get out of the leasing cycle once you start in it. For instance, 5-6 years ago, my leases used to have great residuals and buyouts so that if you really feel in love with the car and wanted to buy it, you could without it breaking the bank. Some companies would even work with you to lower the buyout. That is no more. Now, the car companies inflate the residuals making the buyouts thousands of dollars over msrp and put disposition fees, etc because they want you to return the car at the end of the lease and get something else from them, thus never ending the cycle. I found this out the hard way and one of my vehicles is still on lease. It is going to be my last lease as I'm switching back to financing. "

It may indicate that they either don't understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment. I don't think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they ""cant afford it"". It's kind of like the old saying that people that can't afford to buy the car will lease it. Kind of like how you took affront when, because of your screenname, people assumed you were female. They could very well be much better off than you, the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these cars.

I never mentioned anything about downpayment or anything about lease specifics - so i don't know what we disagree about. The only thing I stated was that Infiniti has better posted lease prices then the BMW- pointing to company listed current leases- not blanket statement - "
"dino001","November 2011"," I looked back at your post. At fist glance G37 looks better than 328 even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments. I looked at the websites and it appears that both have 10K/yr (so you can enjoy your car mostly in your garage, not on the road). However, Infiniti expects dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup - $41K MSRP less $2.7K due is $38.3K, yet net cap cost (including $700 acq. fee) is is $36.4K, so about 2.5 grand comes out of the dealer. BMW deal is structured around MSRP, which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from. If you take out that 2 grand Infiniti dealer contribution, prices become similar. In other words you walk into BMW and you can get your price down by a bit, but at Infiniti it's probably close to bottom line.Add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of brake pads, wipers perhaps some other things). I think it's a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost, but G37 being faster and perhaps better equipped). "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," I may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership I went for oil changes, wipers and tire rotations. Oil changes can be had for 40 bux (sometimes less) at the dealer, rotations another 40 bux - and wipers are 20 bux a year.... Now mind you I own the car (not lease), only one driver and I do not hammer it to redline at stop lights. I'm sure many people have had tl go thru brakes during the same timeline but I think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a little bit more knowing that Infiniti would not fix it on the arm. For larger ticket items the BMW program sounds great- but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard- hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away. (let's not forget the lease return fee as well) "
"dino001","November 2011"," Fat chance on those $40. There is no doubt BMW can get expensive at times. I don't kow prices at Infininti dealers, but all other lux cars (incl. Lexus or Benz) oil changes are easy north of $100 (it's both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so I find it unlikely Infiniti would charge much less. $40 are those mineral oil changes at Chevy, Ford or Toyota, not synthetic. A six pack of synthetic Mobil 1 is almost $40 at Costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car. To balance, BMW has oil changes every 10-15K miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3K miles changes.BTW, Infiniti has lease return fees. Directly from Infiniti website ""Disposition Fee due at termination of lease"". All lease companies do, no exceptions. They may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand. I get it- you like Infiniti. Fine, there is a lot to like. Just don't oversell it. It is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe. Still 40 grand. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Dino - I'm not selling anything I started this trying to clairify costs- that were posted by another who said BMW was had a clear advantage in leasing. clearly you don't totally get it. Do I think the g37 is a better car for my 40k vs a 328 sure- is it better them the 335 - nope but power and price are something I value for sure. Maintenance for a car is great but let's not get blinded by the fact that BMW does this for a reason- they want you to lease and this service helps them resell the car when it comes bac for a premium as certified- its a fantastic model of how to sell cars- and caddy has followed this lead. Oil changes - well click link, 40 bux - no that fat. Now you know. http://herbchambersinfinitiofwestborough.com/Service_and_Parts_Specials "
"dino001","November 2011"," I clicked and I was right. This is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on BMW. So it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison. This also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.Again, G37 is a good car All I'm saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe. And I know you are not selling - well perhaps just your beliefs  . All I'm doing is to clarify your clarifications, trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks. Manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage. Doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say. Again:1. Infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealer's ""participation"" in discount about $2500. Lower BMW price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled.2. Both have disposal fee.3. BMW pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance. Infiniti does not. Just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period. Add oil changes and some rubber and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy.4. Infiniti has better features and power. BMW has better resale. If you want comparable BMW, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.Altogether BMW may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much. In my town BMW dealers are far superior to Infiniti in customer service and sale experience. "
"smarty666","November 2011"," Yeah, I'm going to have to call B.S. on those Infiniti service pricing as I never was quoted any where near that from my local Infiniti dealers for oil and filer and tire rotations. Those two always ended up over $100 bucks, hence why I went somewhere else to have that done. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," You can call it what you want but again a smart shopper knowing dealers have websites and competitors will shop around and get better. Look at the link I posted. Dino, Sure it's not synthetic but the 10-15k time period between changes seems a pretty long time between dealer visits for a 40k car- I guess if its a lease who cares right ? Smarty you had an Infiniti? Weren't you the same guy talking up the TL as well?I think the with the 10 plus thou I saved not getting the 335 I can afford 3 dealer trips a year for oil. "
"dino001","November 2011"," With BMW the car tells you when to go and change the oil. Has nothing to do with the lease. 10-15K is quite normal for regular use. BTW, it is very common in Europe - there nobody uses mineral oil, even on low-end subcompacts, but they do have much longer service periods. It really is just US, where 3K is still prevailing attitude at service stations. In turn, they put mineral oil even into engines that should never see it. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Dino its not worth it, Sweeny is right we are all wrong, go back and read other postings of his and you will see a trend.If Infiniti was the better car, then BMW wouldn't be in business. However when it comes to leasing, no one wins but the banks.Just a FYI, BMW and Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, MB all drop the return fee if you lease another one of their cars, but BMW is the only one who will do it without asking. My First BMW I leased was a 325is and when I bought my 330i the fee was dropped and I never said a word. "
"carnaught","November 2011"," My son recently returned his 2008 G35 after a 3 yr. lease. Although he did not lease or buy another Infinti, there was still no disposal/return fee. Review of his lease agreement confirms no disposal fee. Has this then changed with newer Infiniti leases? "

As I scan through my maint folder on the vehicle it seems it ran between $25 and $36 all these years. Can't account for the Infiniti dealer you frequented but I'm sure some are better than others. How many links are you going to need before you basically stop calling people liars? What does one have to do....scan and post invoices?Um, oil changes at 3k? Who does that anymore. Most newer cars have a 7500 mile change schedule. If people are going to continually exaggerate to make a point what's the sense in trying to have a discussion. Service prices have nothing to do with whether one car is better than another and I don't think that was the jist of this conversation anyway. Someone was just trying to point out the lease cost differences.....not whether one car is better or not. "
"Kirstie_H","November 2011"," Pretty close to what I was paying for my G35 oil changes as well. I sure don't recall ever thinking, ""man, these oil changes are killing me!"" My VW Jetta oil changes were more expensive due to the filter. We have one vehicle that requires $90 oil changes, but it wasn't the Infiniti.I will say that some of the maintenance items were pretty high, but I suspect they're in line with other vehicles in this class.

Since I was curious, I filled the tank twice during the trip, both times at approx. half tank remaining. At the 2 fills, the car displayed 28.3 and 28.0. Excel calculates 26.9 and 27.2. Much of the driving was Interstates [ typically posted 70 MPH and maintaining 75-ish ] or divided rural routes [ typically posted 55 and running 65-ish ] &#150; with some &#145;in town&#146; driving as well.Currently at just over 2,000 miles.Car: 335iS &#150; trans. = seven speed DCT.EPA rating is 17 \ 24.Not bad, methinks, not bad at all.- RayUnable to calculate the MPG for the 1,000+ miles in Europe, because I did not realize until I returned that 2 receipts did not include the number of liters purchased . . . "
"drive4show","November 2011"," Markcincinnatithanks for the info. i appreciate it. i agree that the MPG is good for a car with that amount of power in an AWD version. I imagine the car's FWD bias is partly responsible for that, as is the V-Tec technology. I don't mind the FWD bias as long as the car moves power toward the rear in more spirited driving. The test drive I took proved it does just that. The sales rep knew that I didn't like the amount of torque steer in the FWD model I had previously driven, so he suggested an open route with a lot of curves and he had me push the car to limits beyond what I would normally do with a stranger in the passenger seat. The car was rock solid throughout. i was really sold on the handling. I have not had a BMW or an Audi, so I don't have a true benchmark comparison, but I can safely say the car handles much better than any of the cars I have owned in the past. "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I have (correction, my wife and I have had) twenty-nine Audi's, three BMW's and two VW's since the mid 1970's. We currently have a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium and a 2012 Acura SH-AWD Advance.The Acura, upon first test drive (in a day with several test drives over identical routes and speeds, etc) was ""close to"" a 2011 Audi S4 Premium+ without any additional options (that is, it did not have the torque vectoring option called Sport Differential.)Many -- myself included -- scoff or repress a scoff (that's me) -- whenever I utter or type those words. But damnit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a plumber, no wait, I'm a software guy not a professional car reviewer.But there it is -- a $47,000+ Acura TL drives and feels pretty much like a potentially $59,000 Audi S4 (if they are equipped similarly the Audi's price shoots up, big time.) A serious Automobile magazine comparison of the two cars may not convice you that the Acura should be shopped against the Audi, but the numbers (produced and recorded for both cars) are not that far apart -- and it feels as if the Acura and the Audi are twin-sons of different mothers or something akin to that.look here:http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- di_s4/viewall.htmlIn any case, I was driving a 2009 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport package and 19"" wheels and tires with Audi Drive Select for Pete's sake -- and I wanted a new 2012 Audi. A reasonably well equipped A4 (not S4) could be had for about $47,000, so the Acura, at the price, seemed a good place to compare.Problem was, the Audi came back at a 42 month lease point that was much higher than the Acura's lease point for 36 months.Bzzz. A 4-cyc Audi w/211 HP (and it seemed smaller than the Acura) vs an Acura w/305 HP with every possible do dad that Acura throws on these cars?Even the loyalty and ""pull"" of 29 previous Audis could not make me cough up the extra money (which would have been about $200 per month).In any case, given an identical deal, I probably would have re-upped for the Audi (at the time, in fact, I am certain I would have); but the dollar done me in. Hell, at the time, for the exact same money, I probably would have gone for a Volvo S60 T6 AWD with a few option boxes ticked off.Now, 5,000 miles later -- I am, I admit it -- very pleased with my decision and love to press down on the accelerator and be rewarded with great power and power delivered as if it were coming from an ultra smooooooth turbine.The Acura TL SH-AWD Advance may not quite know what it wants to be, but for the time being it is the bargain of the bunch for performance and content methinks.Still loving the Germans, but temporarily on vacation with the Japanese.-- MarkOh yea, drive it like you live. :shades: "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Glad you like the TL - seems like a nice rig and for the dollar is abetter buy then a loaded a4 but here is another review that's not as glowing. http://m.automobilemag.com/reviews/editors_notebook/1106_2012_acura_tl_sh_awd_ad- - - vance/index.htmlHere is an interesting blurb: ""I appreciate Acura's offering a manual transmission in the TL, but I was not nearly as enamored of it as my colleagues seem to be. Perhaps it felt a little out of place to me because I don't really see Acura as a brand for enthusiasts. Keep making your cars heavier, cancel the development of your V-8 engine, unleash the ZDX on the world, and it's no wonder enthusiasts are more interested in BMW, Audi, and Cadillac these days""This is similar to what I wrote 3 years ago before I got kicked out of a tl chat "

One poster says the CAR is 90% of the Audi. No arguments about the BRAND, but development of a V8, the existence of the ZDX have nothing to do with whether the TL is a good car or not. "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," The article never mentioned the TL as not being good. Infact they said ""When looked at side-by-side with the BMW 3-series, the Volvo S60, or the Cadillac CTS, the TL strikes me as mid-pack at best in terms of performance, refinement, and status and brings up the rear in the looks and sex appeal departments. Although this is a very good car, it lacks emotion and that intangible something that makes it more desirable that its competitors."" "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I have no disagreement with anything either you or the professional reviewer said -- I have found, after some 5,000 miles however, that the Acura is more, er, enthusiastic than I would have, could have, imagined.The overall brand, Acura, faces its detractors and challenges. By the time Acrua had a V8 in the market, ""everyone"" would be writing ""why bother"" as even BMW and Audi are moving to fewer cylinders and blown engines instead of naturally aspirated ones.I give nor take any points away from Acura due to its lack of a V8.It remains true, today, however, that Acura is typically not considered an enthusiast's brand. Some of this perception could change however now that Tony Stark is getting an Acura in the new Avenger's movie (who'da thunk he'd turn in his R8?) :surprise: "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," You are getting right on target for your car. How long did you have to wait for your car to return from Germany? This spring we are doing the European Del on our 535i, the last time I did the Euro Del it took 7 weeks. "

Why dont you try that the next time you are in the market, maybe some of the cars you are malicing will blow your mind.I used to subscribe to Car and Driver several years back, but I realized that if the car does not have a BMW emblem on the hood the reviews went south- hence, I cancelled my subscription.

Us 99% ers could only dream.Mark- I agree the V8 is no longer needed for the brand. "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," Granted that BMW and MB and Audi are downsizing their engines, however you will notice that in their flagship cars, all have a V8 and will stay that way. Acrua needs a V8 to stay competitive in that market or drop the RL all together "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I would assume Audi and BMW (and Merc, Infiniti and Lexus, too) will continue to offer V8's -- why not, they already have them and they are good, often great engines.My point is more to the practical notion that ""what was once a V8 is now a 6"" (either I6 or V6) with a turbo, twin-turbo or super-charger. Likewise, we are increasingly seeing these companies moving from a 6 to a 4, also with forced induction.These changes are being done for a variety of reasons, but the one that seems to get press, is they are using smaller CI engines (with forced induction) to improve the car's efficiency (without sacrificing performance.)Acura may well skirt the ""marketing need"" for more than 6 cylinders by taking the approach of further refining the current 3.7L and then breathing on it, one way or another, to get the HP and torque needed for a flagship vehicle.When I was in Germany I noted the D class cars all over the place, but mostly with smaller engines (an A8 with a V6? yep.) Maybe Acura will pull the covers off of a new ""Honda"" V8 and put it in their flagship car (assuming they can muster, or, better said, WANT to invest in a complete re-do of the RL.)At this point, I care not -- and I have no idea if I will get another Acura.I really like the TL in SH-AWD Advance trim -- but a lesser TL didn't do it for me; so who knows, maybe the next gen Audi (B or C class) will draw me back. In other words, I was passionate about Audi's, but I am much less inclined to be thus insofar as the TL is concerned.The hell of it is, the Acura TL SH-AWD advance is ""more car"" a better performing car (gulp, please forgive me oh Ingolstadt gods) and a more efficient car. Add to that ""everybody"" says Acura's are both reliable AND durable (especially when compared with Audi's, eh?) ""Everybody"" says so, anyway. But this claim, at least, is left to be seen. At 5,000 miles the Acura feels ""new"" (actually better than new now that the engine is a bit looser); but, so did my last 10 Audi's and my wife's last BMW (a 2008 X3 with all the toys on it.)I would tell you my Audi's were reliable (for 50,000 miles), but damn, out of warranty they were breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair. I have only an opinion as to their durability, and, well, I assume Audi's are simply not as durable as some other cars, once the miles climb well above 50K.So, will Acura survive and THRIVE as an LPS or ELLPS without a V8? Beats the heck outta me -- customer's memories are short and most shoppers will probably be unaware of the lack of a V8 offering (if that is what happens) if there is a buttery smooth, powerful and quiet engine that responds to the touch of the accelerator. Any of these companies is now capable of doing that with 4, 6, 8 or more cylinder engines.Acura needs, more than anything, to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up -- the current ""Advance"" campaign is pretty good, but the entire product line needs a refresh and to keep and build a marketing campaign that imbues the brand with a positive image. Currently, the image, if you asked me, is ""We're the Bucky Beaver Brand"" -- with the exception, perhaps, of the ZDX and who knows what the hell that thing is and who it is supposed to ""speak to.""The current TL is a band-aid -- the upcoming generation of all of their vehicles needs to refine the styling cues across the board and update the technology offered.Hopefully the budget and the will to do this becomes evident.In any case, I'm sticking with the ""who cares about offering a V8?"" theme for them.Drive it like you live. :shades: "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," Sween- its actually E63 AMG or the E550. I only have 13K miles on the TL with 3yrs of payment to go. The Mercedes is not on the radar as yet but you never know when the new car itch sets in- maybe next week.:) "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," No doubt that in Germany (Europe) you will find D class cars with 6 cyl's that to me is a given. First time I was in Germany (1981) I had a 520i. However we all now that a 520i wouldn't sell here in the US. If I could afford it, our next BMW would be the 740i (will settle for a 535i for now) with the ( twin turbo I6) to me that is the uber car to have. For less then 3K, that engine can make 400hp with no problem (with the factory turbo) and be stone reliable, no need for a V8.The RL has been the problem child for Acrua, and why? For me, no flagship car should have a V6 as its only engine, and second, the styling doesn't say Flagship. Yes, we all now the factory;s can make lots of HP from a good 6 cyl but many people want a V8. If I'm off base, I would love to hear why..Tony "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," I think you are on-base for some (perhaps many); but, the number of folks who want a V8 is on the decline. I don't know how long it will take for this decline to be big enough to really make a V8 irrelevant, but I do believe it will, eventually, happen.I believe most folks care more about the way the car feels when the accelerator is pressed down (a little or a lot.) If the car feels as if it has weapons grade torque, is smooooooth and quiet (except at full cry), and does not require frequent fill-ups or fill ups that rival a car payment, well what the heck. If the car has a 6 and an electric motor and it is able to meet the requirements noted above -- to hell with what is under the hood.In my observation, which is just that, mine, folks that buy the big buck luxury cars (like the A8 or 7 series, or Lexus barges) are often not enthusiasts.I'd take a 5 series for the most fun over a 7, any day -- especially if I were footing the bill to care and feed it.So, no, to repeat, you are not TODAY off base -- but your statement strikes me as being dangerously close to becoming an historical observation, not a current event for too much longer -- now cut a buck off the price of gas, well, maybe.I remain: Often wrong, but never uncertain.Drive it like you live. :shades:  "

For me the TSX is a great car, however it needs a new engine, take the engine from the RDX and detune it to about 220hp and have it run on regular gas, this would transform the TSX in the car Arcua needs.If Acrua is going to follow other companies, then the TL needs a turbo I4, if BMW can do it, so can Arcua, at the current RDX turbo and add some HP to it.

"flightnurse","November 2011"," Sweeny you have stated that I could have had a 335i for extra $10-20/m if I leased the car, since you assumed I leased it.

Use someone else's money to lease a car and take that $4K and use it for something else.. Lie maybe the stock market..BTW, you asked how do people pay cash for cars... Three ways, they saved up to pay cash, second, made a killing in the stock market or third mommy and or daddy gave them the money. For me it was #1 and #2. When I got out of college, I kept the car I had, a 65 Mustang coupe for about 10 yrs post graduation, at that time I would place $300/m in a savings account, Then bought Harley stock before the stock split (doubled my money) then split again (double it again) and finally split again (doubled it again.) I was able to buy my first BMW cash, and a house in San Diego (this was before the big boom in housing prices) Since then done very well in the stock market and flipping houses (stopped flipping houses for now.) People can buy cars for cash, but there are sacrifices one needs to make to do it. So my 2011 BMW was bought cash as well as the 2005. I take what the money payment would be and stick it in the bank so in 6 years I'll have enough to pay cash for the next one. This is how people pay cash for cars.BTW, the stock market has been very good to flightnurse the past 2 days, got to love when an airline files Chp 11... "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," Nice story- wow - I'm out "
"Kirstie_H","November 2011"," Not everyone can afford to pay cash for each vehicle. However, the key, as in all financial decisions, is to manage your debt. My goal has been to never be upside-down in a vehicle regarding value:debt ratio. Why does the amount have to get bigger? I financed my last car for 5 years (due to unknown future financial circumstances) and paid it off in 4. When that was done, I had a nice downpayment that I chose to use to pay for an entire vehicle in cash. My SO, on the otherhand, has a vehicle he financed for 5 years, almost 4 years into it and it's almost paid off and he intends to keep it. If you're not upside-down and don't have visions of getting the most you can possibly afford, financing is a reasonable solution to not having the full whack.(Stock market was nice to me too, especially Ford, which our stock club bought for something like $4 and sold a few months later for $7) "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Interesting - what if finance rates were 10% ? Would you have financed or looked for a lesser car?

Sween - buy me a G37X & I'll gladly dump my TSX. If the G37 X would have gotten 1 more stinkin MPG (combined), I would've bought one back in '09. I bought my TSX using a $3500 cash for clunkers credit. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," I would not call the tsx a clunker but again congrats on the baby girl. They are the best. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," The clunker was a 1990 E30 BMW 325iA coupe. It only had 82,000 miles on it, but was neglected. I had a new radiator put in, a new set of tires, & an alignment. The car drove great as a BMW should, but it had trouble passing New York State inspection. After it passed, the mechanic said to me that I should either find a donor engine or start paying him to rip out things & replace them with new parts. I knew it was time to ""throw the towel in."". Cash 4 Clunkers came out & I had a 2007 X3 with 38,000 miles (with a year to go & 45K miles allowed for the lease). I loved the 3 series, but it was out of my price range & too small.I drove a Mini Cooper S w/ a 6 speed & didn't like it at all. The G37X which I really dig didn't meet the gas mileage requirements for me to get the $3500 credit.I drove by the Acura dealer & drove the TSX. I thought it drove like a big, 4 door version of my beloved 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH. I didn't like the electric power steering, but the car was to be my wife's daily driver. It has a huge trunk, room in the back for child safety seats, had thickly bolstered seats, a great engine & transmission combination, transmitted some road feel, I was impressed with the suspension dampening. I bought the car and am extremely happy with it.Is a 328i a better driver's car? Absolutely. Is the G37 a balanced handling road rocket? You bet.Is my TSX 75-80% of those cars on public roads? I certainly think so. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," When I bought my BMW I was talking to the sales guy he told me that BMW will finance without stellar credit of a score of 640, but you pay, he quoted me about 8%. However used cars are higher. People will buy just to keep up with others. Now an on interesting note, the same sale guy told me that when it comes to the 6 and 7 series cars, he will have more people pay cash for those car then fiance them or lease them. 5 series its a 50/50 split buy vs lease.3 series is 70/30 lease vs buy.

"kdshapiro","December 2011"," Leasing a car is like renting an apartment. Neither is bad and both have their place. Buying on credit is a personal decision.But one has to be responsible whether it is a house, car, work of art, etc. And I don't think people spend money irresponsibly to keep up with the jones'. People just spend money irresponsibly. Just look at the foreclosures. "
"dino001","December 2011"," You're right, there can be many motivations. ""Keeping up"" is just one of possibilities. A lot of it may not be linked to particular Jones's, but rather to media image of a successful person. When you looked at lifestyles of characters from many shows and compare with real-life earnings power of their jobs, there is often a large disconnect. However, many people would take that as a validation for their acquisitions. And of course commercials.Finishing on lease - it's not the lease itself that is a giveaway, it's the terms. If somebody leases at 0 down for mileage they are actually driving then that's a choice, when they put 4 grand down, 10K miles/year and their commute is 15 miles each way, you know that having car on the driveway was more important that actually driving it. Don't get me wrong - it's their money (or in some cases - it's their not having the money) and their choice to make. But if they wanted to borrow 10 bucks from me, I would automatically assume the likely actual choice here is losing 10 bucks or losing their graces. "

"shipo","December 2011"," ""BMW doesn't use V6, it uses I6 (six in line).""My point exactly. Unfortunately it seems this is about to change as BMW will start using blown V6 engines for the next generation of M3s. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," A friend of mine frequently uses the phrase: ""There's no replacement for displacement."" He is appalled at the number of cars that may offer more than 6 cylinders but rarely sell (or stock) anything other than ""blown"" I4's, I6's or V6's (both naturally aspirated and forced induction.)I tell him that there IS a replacement for displacement and that it is ""volumetric efficiency.""The 211HP 258 pound feet I4 in my 2009 A4 was both quick and fast -- with a 6spd automatic; in the new A4's the engine's rating remains but the car is even quicker, faster and more efficient due to an 8spd automatic. In favor of the V8 S4, Audi switched to a super-charged V6; in the S8 Audi has elected to drop 2 cylinders (from 10 to 8) and produce an engine that is both more efficient and more powerful -- considering its size the S8 is a sipper, not a guzzler.Only one Acura engine is boosted (the I4 in the RDX), and as far as I know there are no Infiniti engines that are either super or turbo charged.The V6 in my 2012 Acura is, frankly, pretty much a basic (but buttery smooth) fuel injected V6 of the modern era. I was wondering what would happen if Acura (Honda) would change to FSI (fuel stratified injection) and super or turbo charge it? Seems to me that with very little effort the engine used today if brought to the current state of the blown art, would put out at least 20% more HP and 10% more torque all the while showing perhaps another +2 MPG's. Then, if they would upgrade the fine 6 speed auto to a current gen 8 speed, any Acura so blessed would go from its current potency (which is very good and is, at this time, Acura's most powerful engine [the 3.7, i.e.]) to high output potency -- in the engine department -- coupled with always being near or at the operating sweet spot due to the increase in the number of gears.Think if Infiniti, currently without any forced induction engine offerings, were to begin offering their engines with a super or turbo charger (and also keeping their 7 speed autos) -- makes my head spin.The Germans (and even the CTS-V) would have something more to worry about, with all these G's, M's, TL's and RL's armed for bear.Will Acura or Infiniti ever up their engine game to this level, or will they take down-tuned engines and alter their breathing and computer maps to get them slightly better than they are now with a touch more grunt in the 0-60 dept? BTW, Infiniti already has a V8, so its creds don't need much engineering brain-power to at least be able to claim ""we have V8's"" even as they are bested by their very own 6's and 4's.I used to assume the car mfgrs read the engthusiasts magazines and the postings here on Edmunds and elsewhere. But, apparentely they don't. If they did and if they were swayed by what is said in both places, well you think they would pay attention and respond (even if only a little bit) to some of the legitmate critiques made by the authors.Audi and BMW are unlikely to loose credibility from a ""sporting intentioned"" family perspective. If someone want's to be certain their car hails from a lineage that includes ""winners"" and a widely accepted high performance heritage, look no further.Acura, perhaps standing all alone, may be shooed from the ELLPS (a.k.a. Premium) board and ""chat room"" based on its historic but currently all but gone lack of focus. Yet the perception that Acura is a bit fuzzy in the perception of premium department remains for them. The ZDX certainly didn't help and allowing the RL to, more or less, atrophy away hasn't helped either. Of all of these car brands, Acura is in the most peril of losing its way.Infiniti and Lexus are mostly safe bets to perservere as players in the ELLPS and LPS field, from what I can tell (although Lexus seems much more the luxury choice than the performance choice, but they are doing a yeoman's job to make this perception go away somewhat.)Mercedes, too, a safe bet if what you really want is a bonafide member of the LPS club.Volvo is, for the most part, doing what I think Acrua should do -- and that is building a performance image to go hand-in-hand with their safety image. They are about in the same position as Acura, the primary difference is Volvo seems to be really trying to put on a performance face these days.Finally the iconic American brand, Cadillac, has demonstrated, these past 3 - 5 years, a penchant for creating an image that may not quite be able to stand toe-to-toe with BMW or Mercedes, for example, but they do keep sneaking up on it with ever more interesting designs and power plants -- including volumetrically enhanced (super-charged) models like the CTS-V.We are in a time of inflection -- 2013 model cars are right around the corner and they continue to excite and delight (with the possible exception of Acura). So here I sit a guy with a history of 29 Audi's, 3 BMW's, 3 VW's and 1 Acura -- wondering why in the hell I got the Acura. But, truth be told, the Acura is not a boring drive, quite the contrary in fact; however, it is somewhat boring to look at and, that more than anything, may be the crux of the matter. :confuse: "
"dino001","December 2011"," New fuel efficiency standards pushed German manufacturers into new areas of smaller blown engines. It's probably both US and Euro driven. I don't think BMW is going I4 turbo because they want to. They do it because they have to.It makes me wonder if lack of such moves on part of Lexus, Infiniti and Acura is because they are considered parts of their parent companies' fleets. If this is the case, it would give them distinct advantage, as lux customer doesn't care about fuel efficiency to same extent as non-luxury. It's not completely non-issue, but it is not a big one. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," My thoughts on my 2010 TSX sort of echo some of your feelings toward your TL SH-AWD. The engine/transmission combination is very smooth. They feel perfectly matched together. I don't oogle over the styling of my TSX like say a 335i w/ M Sport Package, but its design is handsome & far from boring.Could my TSX use more power via DI, FSI, Turbo, or Supercharging? Yes, but then how much torque could the front wheels handle? Would Acura's SH-AWD add too much as far as weight (& price) to its current entry level price tag without stealing sales from the base FWD TL?I'm happy with my TSX. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," The TL should only be sold in AWD trim, IMHO. According to my Ohio dealers, most of the TL's sold are Tech SH-AWD's anyway. I think Acura should do what Audi does in the US -- sell AWD cars (99% anyway) period.Content and price them with options and packages that make sense, but don't push massive amounts of technology in one package. In other words, offer a basic version of the cars (but ONLY in AWD trim.) SH-AWD is damn near magic, it totally transforms the basic FWD car into a really believable ELLPS car. My dealers claim they sell mostly MDX's anyway, so Acura already seems to have at least the possibility of being all AWD all the time like Audi.With the FWD models clouding the message, it seems Acura's sometimes are more like VW's than Audis, yet Acura has essentially stated it wants to be in the Premium class and that it wants to model itself on Audi.I assume this makes sense since VW begat Audi and Honda begat Acura. Audi morphed (in the us) to the ""quattro"" company and claims to be the reigning champeen of AWD cars (with the most history, don't you know?) Audi has essentially eschewed FWD cars (in North America) in favor of AWD cars in order to be taken seriously as a contender in the Premium class -- where only RWD and AWD are taken seriously, it's in all the papers.Acura keeps hanging on to its Honda roots where it's good AND where it's not so good, premium perception-wise. Audi, morphed from FWD to FWD and/or AWD to AWD, period. They entered and won contests and races and Wards awards and other awards, but these awards and the spoils of winning were all accomplished with their AWD versions. Although I guess you could buy an FWD A4 or A6, I don't know where you go to actually find one in the flesh for sale at a dealer.And Audi did wonder ""how much power can one put throught the front wheels"" -- its answer was ""not enough, so we need to put MORE power through the front AND rear wheels."" And they are where they are now by taking the risk of virtually dropping FWD from the NA market.And what happened next? BMW brought out the 325 (in 1988 (?) as I recall, since I had one) with AWD; then Mercedes started offering AWD here and there. Acura, Infiniti, Lexus, Volvo, VW, Cadillac, Buick and, and, and, the list goes on to cover every LPS and LPS wannabe brand and product. As to the price impact -- I think it would be pretty easy to keep the price of an all SH-AWD fleet at about the current FWD models + $1,500; for the safety and performance this would offer, to say nothing of an image enhancement similar to that which Audi enjoyed, it is probably not a show stopper for the company.And, most of us shopping in this class will probably not reject a new Acura that is exclusively offered with SH-AWD. For most, it ought to be a no-brainer.I have nothing against FWD, btw, I just think it would be very helpful to Acura if it has the goal of remaining a serious premium class brand, to completely ditch any and all FWD offerings from its lineup.  :surprise: "
"shipo","December 2011"," Funny thing, for my current needs, wants and desires, the ""perfect"" car for me right-now-today would be an Audi A3 RWD (sacrilege I know, but I want it none-the-less) with a hotted up 2.0T and a 6-Speed manual. Of course no such a critter will ever exist, but one can dream can't one. :blush: "
"dino001","December 2011"," I think Acura should do what Audi does in the US -- sell AWD cars (99% anyway) period. That's not entirely accurate. A3s and A4s are sold here mostly in FWD (Tampa). I asked a salesguy about it once. He surprised me. To Audi without AWD is like nonalcoholic beer or worse. "

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," I think that's an excellent idea. Definitely a great way to differentiate Acura from its Honda roots. Buyers here in the northeast & new England will buy anything and everything AWD. Give my TSX a turbo, SH AWD, & excellent brakes (the oem brakes are pathetic) & I'd give it another look. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," If my message somehow went too far, I apologize -- I do not believe that moving to an all AWD line-up (or 99%, as in the case of Audi -- and in the case of Audi it is 100% of their advertising) will alone re-position Acura in the minds of the intended customers.As I mentioned in my earlier post, the crux of the issue is not how these cars drive (if the 2012 TL Advance SH-AWD is any indicator), they are not a boring drive, not an incompetent drive, nor lacking in performance. The thing is the cars are pretty much not very attractive -- even if they do get bonus points for trying to look different.They have the driving thing in pretty good shape as far as I'm concerned -- they need to modernize the engines and look at the content that is offered by every car brand/product they wish to emulate and be guided accordingly.They need to consider making themselves perceived solely as an AWD company and they need an across the board styling transplant or upgrade asap.Probably more than any other step they could take, styling is the one that will bear the most fruit. For, no matter how much they up their game in the performance or content arena, people need something to draw them to the showroom and something to feel good about after they buy.My '12 TL is ""better"" in so many ways than my '09 A4 -- which was the first year for the change to the B8 platform for Audi. I would not expect this to remain thus -- a refreshed A4, most likely, will again be more attractive (in all the above ways) than the current TL (from a design perspective mainly.)You don't have to agree with the magazines, but the current A6, which looks very much like a larger B8, A4, is winning friends, awards wise. No Acura is on any list I can find. BMW, too, remains a repeat top choice amongst those who award wins for being great.Acura simply needs a style-ectomy, soon. :sick: "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Style I agree - I also think they need to go cheaper to find youth buyers. We have heard from owners that the TSX is a great value - but it's still 30k an bulk of the buyers are older people- make a 25k coupe with a power 4 that gets youth in the door. All in you can't pick a car under the Acura nameplate that says look at me - ""I'm rediculously good looking"" - and that's a major problem. Love the traction this is finally getting - its time to release the TsX from this Elpps chat once and all as a lesson to Acura you can't stand around for 10 years and do nothing in an evolving car biz. (sorry for typos, iPhone) "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Sween - I agree with you & Mark that the Acura lineup definitely needs a makeover. You are right that none of the models scream ""I gotta have it.""Like I said, my TSX is handsome (IMHO) but its styling doesn't compare to BMW, Audi, MB.Practicality, Luxury, & Technology are driving people into Acura showrooms rather than style & performance. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," Isn't the upcoming RSX supposed to come in at a lower price point? Of course then there's the issue that the TSX is supposedly a cancelled product and that the TL will shrink in size.But if you can at least suggest that you can offer a lower entry point, price-wise, you may find you attract more and younger customers. Truth be told the TL is actually much bigger feeling than my outgoing A4, which did, technically, have a longer wheel-base, but the TL is wider.Again, we seem to be in violent agreement, Acura needs an overall styling cue that is spread across all cars and, first and foremost, is attractive.You may or may not like the look of an Audi, but the entire line from the lowest cost A3 to the big buck A8L or R8 all have cues that they are Audi's.BMW, ditto.Acura is trying with their beak front end, but it obviously wasn't working for them, considering the plastic surgery the TL just underwent.C'mon let's make some good looking cars -- at all price points!

Just look at latest Civic and Accord. The ""sportyish"" DNA is all but gone, virtually no trace. I recently a rented Accord (yes, I was surpirised myself - Hertz had Accord in their rental fleet). Mechanicals were adequate, but the car did not impress me at all. Really cheap interior, barge look, even some ergonomics were not so great (always strong suit of Japanese cars).

I'm also really impressed with the sub 6 second 0-60 time. I can't wait until BMW puts this thing up on their build your own on their website. "
"dino001","December 2011"," I still rather have NA straight 6. Perhaps if (when) gas goes to 5-6 buck a gallon, I'll change my mind. I basically decided to jump in and get one before new 328, exactly because of the four cylinder replacing base six in 328 (got the wagon, so no 335i on that, plus 50K+ after some options still too much for me). Boy, what a sweet machine - drove it in Germany on Autobahn, got to 138 mph before traffic stopped me. Now waiting for delivery in Spartanburg - probably in January. Don't care about lower gas mileage, don't care about lower weight, higher power/torque. I just wanted that NA straight six - it's probably one of the best engines in the history. And I bet BMW would never have changed, if not for the new CAFE.I had enough four cylinder turbos - 2002 WRX and 2008 WRX STI, which are boxers, inherently better configurations that straight four. Fast, great handling, in some aspects may better than 328 (allows faster corner entry and maintains that speed throughout). Still - I just wanted more ""adult"" car than my STI, was ready to give up some power and even some handling. To me BMW 3-series was always about two things: weight distribution (50/50) and straight six. The 328 I just bought had interior that is just OK, but it looks like it was designed thirty minutes before the car was to be released - give some nice leather and wood inlays, add dashboard from 1989 and you're done. The car overcomes that in those mechanical aspects, but take of of them away and other choices become very compelling. Audis are so much better looking(by a mile) both inside and out, have better equipment, cheaper. Or being a little on frugal side, I may get even lower to TSX (not sure about that, but would give it a try) or even Volvo V50. To me BMW voluntarily gave up something they had over their competition. They better make it up in other areas - or else. "
"qbrozen","December 2011"," Not all engines are created equal, though. You can't condemn all 4-cyl turbos based on your subaru experience. The turbo boxer 4 is actually quite coarse compared to, say, the 2 liter VW turbo. That same 2 liter is also smoother and much more flexible than Volvo's I5 turbo. So you should really withold judgegment until you try it. "
"dino001","December 2011"," That's not what I meant. Actually Subaru boxers are great. Exhaust note is almost as intoxicating as that on the BMW's six. But I have not met I4 that I was impressed with. To me they all sound like sewing machines. They may be quiter (some) or more powerful than those from Subaru (not many, esp. STI), but it usually comes with high cost (counterweight balance shafts). Boxer is naturally balanced, just like straight six and offers low CG. No, I'd rather have the H4, or even I5 before I would get I4. But more important - I got I6, which is what all I wanted for now. :shades: "

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," According to the web-zine, Winding Road: their review of the new I4 turbo makes me feel that one would not feel slighted having a BMW with this motor, quite the contrary. Their comments about the new larger 3 series, also encouraging. "
"shipo","December 2011"," Agreed. All else being equal I'd opt for a normally aspirated I6 over a blown I4, however, all else ain't even close to being equal. Specifically: - The I4 Turbo has more maximum power and torque, and a substantially wider/flatter power band. - The I4 Turbo weighs significantly less than the I6 which will aid in handling and fuel economy. - The I4 Turbo is shorter (albeit wider by virtue of the turbo and its requisite plumbing) than the I6, and as such is easier to package which should in turn make service easier. - The I4 Turbo returns significantly better fuel economy.This is not to discount the fact that I6 motors are naturally balanced and have virtually no torque reversal events (of which there are two for every rotation of a 4-Cylinder/4-Stroke engine), and as such are naturally smoother both in operation and in power delivery. That said, the portion of the roughness of an I4 which is attributable to the engine's natural imbalance is A) relatively minor due to its 2.0 liter displacement (the threshold beyond which balance shafts become increasingly necessary), and are easily cancelled via a relatively small/light weight set of balance shafts.Long story short, take a drive in a late model GTI or A3 (or A4 or A5) 2.0T and try and find something objectionable about the power delivery vis-?-vis a late model 328i. I've now had two I6 BMWs; the engine in my wife's new GTI is easily on par with the unit installed in both of my mounts from Munich. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Mileage I haven't heard yet from anyone who has a new 528i or Z4, but in theory it should get better mileage, however its a realitive thing if you are always in the boost then mileage is going to suck. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Shipo this is encouraging to hear, but when your friends say high 30's they can't mean 37 or 38 on highway.

"shipo","December 2011"," The highway MPG number that I've heard bandied about is just what you suggested, 37 to 38. That said, I don't think it will be much of a show-stopper for the new 320d (either version) because, while the numbers are harder to squeeze out of those in the know, very high forties or low fifties are what I'm led to believe. "
"busiris","December 2011"," According to info posted about the new Z4 sDrive 28i on www.fueleconomy.gov, its estimated to get 33mpg hwy, with the new 8 speed transmission.While I would never say never, I don't see how a larger car will use the same, or very similar running gear and do better than the Z4. I can't see the high 30's... At best, the very low 30's, which is still nothing to whine about, IMO. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," When I go there, I normally put 50'to 100 miles a day on my car. If I worked in Phoenix I would commute 80 miles r/t. To me that's piling on the miles. "
"shipo","December 2011"," The numbers I've been quoted are for RWD and Manual Transmission equipped F30 328i models; in the case of the Z4 this configuration yields 34 mpg on the highway. That said, my understanding is that while the engine in the 2012 Z4 is the same basic engine, the unit which will find its way into the F30 has a few changes. As I understand things, the new engine should deliver slightly more power and better fuel economy.Time will tell.  "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," With the added power, better Mpgs and it being a little bit lighter - question will be why would anyone buy a 335 ?

Tune the suspensions for comfort rather than handling prowess?The Acura statement says something about getting away from Honda -- yet two of the 5 cars will be tarted up Hondas (which may be a good thing since the price will, apparently, be low -- but no SH-AWD?) Bummer.Well, I think the performance of the '12 TL 3.7 SH-AWD Advance is very Audi-like -- will Acura hold the line and NOT improve this, or will the new TL (whatever it may be called) be tuned for a more Buick like ride and not be granted direct injection or a turbo or super-charger (option).Stating that you WANT to be the best second tier car you can be seems akin to (almost) throwing in the towel.My wife, lusting for an MDX to replace her FX35 (for the SH-AWD) is rethinking this now.I am wondering if my '12 is my first and last Acura?32 months to go.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," We can talk about ALMOST anything we want on this particular forum -- and unless we wander too far off subject or get rude and crude or start making ad hominem statements to others, well, it seems to be tolerated.At the moment, my interests are somewhat of a strategic or future nature; I am wondering what in the wide wide world of sports Acura means by its statement that it will ""de-emphacize""performance (at least that is how it read to me.) Sure, we're talking about ELLPS cars here, but I don't think that suggests that we're not interested in performance.I am interested in these cars, at this point in time, due to the fact that they give their owners most of the """"L"" of the LPS cars and almost all of the ""P"" (or at least they seem to have up until now.) If Acura wants to no longer persue ""P"" does that mean they will focus more on ""L""? I mean how can you remain in the Premium class if you are not either heavy on the ""L"" (Lexus and often Mercedes comes to mind) or heavy on the ""P"" (and Audi and BMW -- and sometimes even Cadillac -- spring to mind).It seems Acura is attempting to prep me (if I can be prepped, that is) to accept ""good cars,"" since we're no longer going to even try to make great cars (insofar as lux and/or performance is concerned.)The 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance seems to embody a lot of performance and a lot of luxury (in the ELLPS world, I mean) at a good price. My TL's content for the dollar seems high -- considering, too, that Acura seems more willing to deal on the selling price than, say, Volvo or Audi.As I read the variety of ""press release"" type of communications coming out of Acura these past couple of days, they seem to be saying -- we're going to have 5 really good cars and 1 super car to choose from. We are going to build, mostly, ""really good cars"" -- we're going to focus on value, green-ness and that Acura DNA (whatever that is). They continue by saying, ""Our customers tell us they don't buy our cars first and foremost for performance -- and even a great sound system is #5 on our surveyed customer's list.""I am interested in hearing from you on this topic and others and about other manufacturers. Hell, I'd bet I've had more Audis that the vast majority of folks and I would be glad, damn glad, to chat and opine and bloviate on that subject too.Let's get back to talking about the cars.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," I am guilty of being:Often wrong. . .but. . .Never uncertain.My ""take"" on Acura is based soley on what I read (in the present tense) and what I have read (previously.) I read, with a dubious eye, the Automobile magazine article wherein an Audi S4 was ""tested against"" an Acura TL SH-AWD. No way you say?I recall my initial reaction as, ""yea, sure the two cars finished neck-and-neck, pull the other one."" Read the article for yourself -- just google it.Sitting there on my couch reading the Automobile article as a person who was at the time driving his 29th Audi (that either my wife, my company or I had either leased or purchased) since 1977 and also knowing that I was soon due to turn in my 2009 Audi A4 2.0T quattro sport, I thought, ""I'll test drive all the ELLPS cars that I can, and that includes the TL.""It didn't hurt any that Motor Week also had a favorable take on the 2012 TL 3.7 AWD as did most of the automobile magazines I subscribe to (Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend and Road & Track) and read (add to the list European Car and Popular Mechanics.)My wife after 3 BMW's (and many Audi's) had leased an Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium last December; and, since we had spent some time at the Infiniti dealer here in Cincinnati, I had taken several G's and M's out for at least four test drives to see if they really were the ""Japanese BMW's."" For the most part, they are, I discovered.So you see, I had read all the magazines, participated in the Audiworld and Edmunds forums for years and had started test driving cars in the ELLPS and LPS class. I was um, an ""amateur expert"" on the subject matter. The confluence and influence of all the above events got me to test drive an Acura MDX, RDX, ZDX and TL SH-AWD [Advance], an Audi A4 2.0T [Prestige], S4 ('11) [Premium Plus], A5, A6 ('11 and '12) and A7, a BMW 3X, 5X, X3, X5 and X6, a Cadillac CTS/4 3.6 Performance Luxury, a Honda Crosstour, an Infiniti G37X and M37X, a Volvo S60 T6 and a VW Passat CC with the VR6 engine/AWD and a VW Toureg. I probably test drove some other cars like a Taurus SHO, a Genesis and a Jeep Grand w/a Hemi, but they were never really something I took seriously.What got me off the ""I GOTTA have another Audi"" mind-set was the back to back to back to back test drives of a pair of Infinitis (the G and M), an '11 Audi S4, the Cadillac CTS and the '12 Acura TL. As I recall the order of the tests, the only fact of significance was the fact that I reluctantly, more or less, tested the TL after I had tested the S4 and the CTS.Other than the lack of interior grab handles for the front seat passengers (which I consider a very important feature for Cadillac to have overlooked), the Cadillac was, er, sublime -- an American Luxury Performance Sedan; the S4 was also very impressive and typifies the German Performance Luxury Sedan -- and the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (which had the ""benefit"" of my low expectations) which, from the driver's seat, actually seemed ""about as quiet as the Cadillac"" and ""about as HOT as the Audi S4."" What?!? Blasphemy!If you've taken back to back to back test drives --over the IDENTICAL route, playing the IDENTICAL CD on the sound system and pushing the cars into corners at IDENTICAL speeds -- you will understand how it is possible to see cars you might only have test driven for a lark in a whole new light.Standouts in the entire bunch (w/o regard to price): the TL, S4, A7, BMW 335 w/x-drive, the M37X w/Technology Package, and the S60 T6. The CTS and the CC get a ""quite nice"" rating. If money were no object, I'd probably go for the A7 Prestige or S4 w/sport differential (think of that as the German SH-AWD -- aka torque vectoring.) If money were REALLY no object, I'd probably wait for the upcoming Audi S8 and learn to smoke cigars and swill cognac or grappa.Money being an object, I narrowed my choices down a bit, but was able to strongly consider an M37X (due to fantastic lease deals) and a '12 Audi A4 2.0T Prestige w/sport pkg. I also considered the Volvo but found them totally unwilling to budge off of sticker (or $1,000 off.) Just because the '12 TL SH-AWD Advance was the sleeper of the bunch (in terms of performance), priced right (at $47,000 as I wanted it) and had enjoyed the Automobile S4 vs TL comparison article, I kept it on my list.Well cut off my legs and call me shorty -- the TL came in at 87% of MSRP, a low money factor and no-wait for it to be shipped from Europe (it is made here in Ohio) -- no other car even came close to the ""value"" the TL presented.I, at the time, ONE time (so far), turned my back on Audi and took the plunge into a non-German car. The Acura TL does NOT blow me away like the S4 or A7, for instance. Yet, like some wines, the TL does seem to be impressing me more as it ""ages"" (miles). I do not consider it to be an Audi S4 clone, even though the Automobile article is very complimentary of the TL's performance vs the Audi's. The TL is, as I have written elsewhere, ""close to fine"" (as if ""fine"" is a destination.)I now am at a place where I will probably consider Acura again based on my current experience. Yet the recent press releases about the upcoming Acura line-up is a cause for concern. They seem to be saying, ""we're giving up on being a tier-1 Premium Car Company."" Time will tell.If you have not test driven (i.e., a good long test drive) the TL Advance SH-AWD (and ONLY the Advance SH-AWD, not the lesser configurations, and certainly not the FWD version, period) and you are looking to purchase a new car from the ELLPS line-up, I do encourage you to take the long test drive -- even if the somewhat beaky styling puts you off -- of the TL Advance SH-AWD, back to back to back with the cars you are more seriously considering. What can it hurt?The TL's styling may be too much for you to overcome and perhaps the price I got was a fluke or a once in a lifetime deal -- hence the TL will remain unattractive to YOU no matter how impressively it may perform. Perhaps too, you are a cash buyer and then the Volvo may merit more consideration (I was interested in the lowest lease price I could get and the Acura's discount and money factor were compelling.)In any case, as I have said, what could it hurt to spend a day test-flogging, or, test-driving three or four very nice cars, including, just for the fun of it, the Acura TL Advance SH-AWD.Drive it like you live. Often wrong, but never uncertain,Mark :shades: "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," http://drivetofive.wordpress.com/im guilty of being honest and speaking the truth.Above is an article about a man and his car- we all talk about current cars belonging in the group, some very clear, others not so much- but its pretty clear to me reading this blog and knowing the car he rides and talks of - this was one of the pioneers for this group- and to see what the brand has become over those 500k miles disheartens me. I remember once I got a license 16 years ago the car I wanted was a legend coupe 6 speed, with the souped up Type2? Engine. I settled for a 89 maxima which in itself was a great car but not the looker the Acura. My first new car was a 2000 Acura integra gs-r coupe- redline was almost 9k Rpms and I took it to that level every day- loved the car and the service.

Many posts have been written to the effect that the TSX is something of Yugo in terms of its deserving to be discussed here. Oh well. . .Funnily enough, I used to give him a lot of jazz about the substandard (at least perceived) reliability of Audis vs., well, just about anything else, but particularly Asian vehicles. That he and I share a brand at this point is well beyond surprising.Times change. "

I had 1 Infiniti Q45 (second year of Infiniti) love it, too bad it too Infiniti so long to get back to their roots.After my Vigor, I went to BMW, and haven't looked back. "
"fedlawman","December 2011"," I wanted a Legend so badly when it first came out. And the 2nd gen Legend Coupe - still gorgeous even today.When I was in college my girlfriend's dad had a Vigor. I thought it was very nice at the time too.The TSX is very much like a modern day Vigor - only it performs better in every way.It's not that Acura has lost it's way. The TSX, TL, RL were a very logical lineup for a near-luxury brand. Time has simply marched on and Acura hasn't kept up. They cannot use the Accord as a platform for their entire lineup any longer, and they cannot market any Civic-based car as an Acura.A three-car lineup moved upmarket is what Acura needs to compete. Make the TL the entry-level sedan with a choice of engines (base car would be FWD 240 hp I-4 turbo from the RDX, top would be AWD with the 3.5L V-6). Next the RL should be a RWD and AWD 5/7 Series competitor (base engine the 3.5L V-6 and top engine a V-8). Finally, introduce a small RWD luxury-sports coupe/convertible (think M-B SLK or Lexus SC). Same engines as the Legend, but smaller and lighter. "
"wireless","December 2011"," They need to work on their styling first. That's half the battle. I saw a new Acura TL coming and going with the beak/grimace fore and aft. It's ust cringeworthy. No one in that entire company had the nerve to tell them that it looks awful before it was released. Poor Honda. "
"dino001","December 2011"," If Audi can its sell Golf-based A3, so could Acura sell Civic-based RSX, RIP. The problem is packaging and pricing. There has to be enough separation between the vehicles.I think TL is a nice vehicle. Don't really care for its nose styling, but that can be fixed. Same with TSX. The problem is at the top - RL is on verge of being irrelevant. I have not seen one in months. However, their main problem is the line - it's just too short. Their ""all inclusive"" approach is great for people looking for a good trade-up deal, but does not impress people with money looking to be awed. No coupe, no convertible, no buzz-creating (albeit not necessarily profitable) supercar, no exciting supersedan - that's a big problem for an aspiring luxury manufacturer. Too little choice - premium market likes choice. People with money like to be different from others. Even Lexus has long lines on different packages on their cars. I think biggest problem for Acura is Honda'a accountants - they probably don't give them enough to develop a real luxury lineup. To understand why one has to look at Honda as a company, where automobiles are just a part of a much bigger structure, within which Acura is just a small line in corporate balance sheet. "

"fkong","December 2011"," I recently leased an IS350 F-Sport. Before making this decision, I also looked at a few other cars, and will let you guys know why I went with the big L. Even my brother was excited that I got the IS350, versus any of the other cars.Acura TL - I did consider this car. I actually do find the car to be quite attractive. But, I find that it's a bit huge. Plus, why this car isn't RWD is a whole new story, and I don't want AWD. I can accept the front beak problem.Audi A4 - Audi's never really appealed to me. Don't get me wrong, they're nice. My brother has an A6 that I do find some beauty in, but they just aren't my cup of tea. And, same situation with the Acura, why isn't it RWD?BMW 3-series - Cost more than my IS350 F-Sport to begin with (almost $47k for the 328i w/ M-Sport package, Nav, auto, parking sensors) versus my car (F-Sport package, Nav, Backup camera, auto, NO parking sensors). Chances are, if I want the 335, it'll be more than $50k. Plus, I don't want to look like every other guy on the street. I'm in So Cal, and the 3-series are more popular than Camry's here.Cadillac CTS - I wanted to buy American, but America's definition of luxury involves the use of low end materials. I do like the car, though.Infiniti G37 - If I were to get the Infiniti G, it would be the coupe (I had a G35 coupe a few years ago and love it). Therefore, I won't be getting a ELLPS. I find the G sedan to be absolutely ugly, plus the fact that it's so big. At least it's RWD.Mercedes C-class - I do like the way the C-class looks, but the C250, after configuring, costs as much as my IS350. I do believe that Mercedes finally decided they wanted a piece of the ELLPS pie, and seriously upped the ante with the C-class. The previous 2 generations of C-class were, IN MY OPINION, bad jokes gone wrong. BMW, at least, had the right formula with the 3-series.With these points, I decided to go with the IS350, and absolutely love it. Perhaps when the lease is up, I might step up to the new 2013 GS.  "
"shipo","December 2011"," Agreed on the Civic versus Golf thing. Three years ago I needed a new inexpensive commuter car and after test driving both cars (in addition to the Corolla, the Focus, and the Mazda3) I had settled on a Golf (called a Rabbit back then); the Civic simply wasn't in the same league. Unfortunately due to the Mark V to Mark VI model change-over, all of the Rabbits with manual transmissions had pretty much been sold and the only cars left were automatics; I ended up with a Mazda3 instead.Fast forward to this year, my wife was looking for a new car, and while we didn't drive a Golf per-se, we did drive a GTI, and once again I was impressed with the vault like feeling of the car; after thirteen and a half years of driving exclusively minivans, my wife now has a new 2-Door black GTI 6-Speed sitting in her garage bay. Can't wipe the silly grin off of her face.  "

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," So my driving a TSX V6 (no tech pkg) loaner car has got me thinking about our board's Acura debate, argument, disagreement, thing. The TSX V6 has got some guts to it. I don't think it gives up that much fuel economy compared to my 4cyl. I do feel the extra 200 pounds in the nose though.Acura's lineup right now has too much overlapping. There is a mere $885 difference between the TSX V6 w/ Tech Pkg (a small percentage of TSX sales) & a TL w/ Tech Pkg (FWD). The difference between a TL (FWD, No Tech Pkg) & a TSX (4cyl) w/ Tech Pkg is $2695.Sween & Mark have both made some excellent points regarding the TSX, the TL, & the future of Acura.Here's what I have to say:Acura wants to be a sport/luxury division of Honda. The TSX is a good entry level starting point. Ditch the 4cyl & make the TSX V6 the base model. Acura constantly offers $4000 incentives on the V6 model anyway, so just make that the base engine. Offset the nose heaviness with Acura's SH AWD.Now this is easy for me to say. It does have some problems though. The TSX V6 w/ Tech Pkg weighs in at 3680 lbs. Add another 241 lbs for Acura's SH AWD system. You've got a grand total of 3921 lbs. That's a big pill to swallow for sween who thinks the base TSX is too heavy.The other problem about making SH AWD available on the TSX is its cost. $3550 per car is what Acura charges now on a TL.I really do LOVE Mark's idea of making SH AWD standard across the line. More on this later. "
"tlong","December 2011"," I just can't see going 6cyl on the entry car as making any sense. It destroys the handling and further bloats up an already bloated TSX relative to the original. And even BMW is going 4cyl. Just seems like a bigger bloated entry boat of a car isn't the way to go. "
"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Acura doesn't have a weight trimming budget like BMW does. You are also forgetting that the enthusiast community as a whole makes up such a small percentage of the car buying public.Did I notice the extra 200 lbs in the nose of my V6 TSX loaner? Yes.

"tlong","December 2011"," Do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider AWD a luxury feature? Yes. Do they pay a price premium for it? Yes. Do they care that AWD adds weight? No.I understand the needs for AWD in certain climates.Acura was successful for a long time with the Integra and Legend. Then it was the TSX and TL. And now it is the fat TSX and fat TL and useless RL. The fuel economy regulations are getting tougher and tougher. BMW is going 4 cyl in the US on smaller cars. BMW and Infiniti sell a LOT of cars based upon sporty handling, which is something that Acura has lost much of in the TSX. Adding a fuel hogging 6 cyl, then throwing 200 lbs. of AWD for the *entire market* seems like the wrong direction to me for an ELLPS.Acura must decide what it wants to be.A luxury Subaru? - then perhaps your suggestion makes sense.A cheaper Lexus? - keep numbing them up and improve dealer service even more.A bargain BMW? - Sorry, they were more in that camp before the latest refreshes.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," Market the AWD for winter needs in the snowy climates & as a performance advantage in the areas where the weather is nice.TSX 4cyl Automatic - 22 city / 31 highwayTSX 6cyl Automatic - 18 city / 28 highwayDriving my 4cyl & the dealer's 6cyl back to back gave me a good perspective on the strengths & weaknesses of each.Steering - One thing I truly dislike about my 2010 TSX 4 cyl is the lifeless electric power steering. It transmits no road feel at low speeds and artificially firms up at higher speeds.The 6 cyl is equipped with hydraulic power steering. While a little over boosted for my tastes, it is progressively linear and very smooth. I totally prefer this setup to the electric unit in my 4 cyl.The V6 has an obvious edge in the acceleration department. Jump on the accelerator and it keeps going. I was traveling at triple digit speeds this AM berore I backed off and returned to a much more sedate 70. Passing is never a problem. My 4 cyl's acceleration is adequate. It never feels strained. I also know how to use the engine's high RPM power band. Merging onto the highway and cruising at 80 - 90 mph aren't a problem. I have to admit that getting back into my car tonight I was disappointed after driving it's V6 cousin for a day.Both cars ride nicely without feeling isolated. The handling edge goes to my 4 cyl TSX hands down. While far from a dedicated RWD chassis, the TSX makes the most of its Accord platform roots. There is a lightness to it. You can feel the weight transfer going around curves.The V6 is 200 lbs heavier & you feel the boat anchor during spirited driving. The VSA (skid control) is constantly fighting with this giant weight over the front wheels.The TSX is definitely (IMO) a luxury, performance oriented vehicle. Having driven both the E90 BMW 3 series (in both 328 & 335 flavors) as well as the Infiniti G37X, I think there's NO argument from anybody they are the true driver's cars of the group.I've read up and am impressed by the new Mercedes-Benz C-class reviews, but will reserve judgement until I actually get behind the wheel of one.I think even though it is FWD, the TSX stacks up against an Audi A4 2.0T (not the $50,000 prestige with Audi's Sport Differential).I've told you guys before, I originally bought the TSX for my wife using a cash for clunkers credit. I inherited it from her when we decided to buy a Pilot in anticipation of our 3rd child (Whitney is 3 weeks old today). Would I have bought it for myself if I went out car shopping for my daily driver that didn't have fuel economy restrictions? It wouldn't have been my 1st choice, I'll readily admit.Driving Dynamic wise, I'd pick the E90 3 then the G37XS sedan, & a distant 3rd would be the TSX.I'm happy with my TSX. "

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," I agree that a large majority of folks probably don't know if their 2WD cars are front or rear drive. I believe that folks who buy AWD are aware that all four wheels are driven -- they may or may not know if the bias is F or R, however.With virtually every Audi and BMW now or soon to be NOT naturally aspirated and likely 2 cylinders less than previously, I suspect many folks won't know if their A4 or 3 series or A6 or 5 series is a 6 or an 8 (respectively.)The fuel costs are probably more noticed than the # of cylinders.It may not be accurate for the whole country, but the Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Mercedes and Volvo dealers (and the sales of CTS Cadillacs) sales are -- well over 50% AWD these days (speaking as one from SW Ohio.) The Infinity dealer, in fact, sells some 90% of the EX, FX and M class vehicles as AWD (I suspect the same is true of the G's, I have simply not bothered to check on them).AWD for the non-purist, non-high-performance buyer is the performance option. And, of course, the two local Audi dealers basically ONLY sell quattros, to those in the know and those who don't care, period.We long-time Audi mavens also believe that quattro is THE performance set-up, wet or dry. Locally, I can't recall the last time I saw more than a few RWD Bimmer's either (but remember we are talking about SW Ohio where we ""sometimes"" have a snow fall that lingers more than 24 hours.)I have taken (four times) the Audi driving experience in Seefeld, Austria and (once) the BMW X-Drive school (here in the US -- in South Carolina), and although the ""purists"" who attend do proclaim RWD is the best, even they admit that BMW's are not very much fun on anything other than dry pavement, hence their purchase of an X-drive BMW and their attendance at the BMW X-Drive school.Overall, even the driving instructors (in both schools) are converts to AWD and Torque vectoring rear diffs, since we all drive our cars on both normal and low coefficient of friction surfaces often in the same day. In the ideal world, so many speak of, ""RWD rules,"" but perhaps since it ""never rains in Southern California"" RWD cars are seen as handfuls for the proletariat (those not living in SoCal.) In terms of preferences then, it seems that a lot of (the majority) folks -- if given the choice (and care) will opt for AWD, FWD and RWD in that order.Of course, to be crystal clear, I am speaking from the point of reference of those who care to comment who live in SW Ohio, SE Indiana and Northern Kentucky.Drive it like you live.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," In my garage are two cars, one Acura and one Infiniti. For over twenty years that would have read two Audis; then for six years that read one Audi and one BMW. My wife and I have had twenty-nine Audis, three BMW's and two VW's.Prying German cars out of our hands was a major accomplishment for the two Japanese mfgrs noted above in the first sentence.The latest news on Infiniti products pertains to the new JX crossover. But if you are an enthusiast this vehicle will hardly light your candle. FWD bias, CVT transmission and a sub-300 hp 3.5L V6. Although the vehicle impresses visually (and yes I'll grant that is subjective) and has gobs of passenger room, it strikes me as Infiniti's Acadia. Yawn.I have been searching for an update to the ""aging"" (my words) G line, but have found nothing that even smells like a future product direction. I would hope, however, that the G grows in width to, say, A4 dimensions. It strikes me as a bit odd that the TL from Acura has a shorter wheelbase than either the A4 or the G37, but only the G feels cramped inside. If I can sit in the driver's seat and reach across to the passenger's window, I feel the vehicle is too narrow (for its length) in the ELLPS class. The A4 has grown in wheelbase, length and width (with a slight increase in legroom), as has the upcoming BMW 3 -- and the TL is damn near 5 series or A6 size. The G, for me, makes me feel like a bug.When I get behind the wheel of a G, I feel like I did the first time I got into a Ford Econoline van, I mean I feel like I am sitting on the front bumper.Now, the Infiniti in my garage is a 2011 FX35 Premium in black gloss with a java interior. I feel like I am piloting the hulk when I drive it. It feels big, powerful, broad shouldered and nimble all at the same time. I also got that feeling from my many test drives of an M37X. I would have had an M were it not for the requirement to buy a $3,000 option package just to get blind spot warning.I would suspect little will change for a few more years in the M's, since they are only 2 MY old. The corporate grill that has been added to the FX's makes me believe that the FX line will be refreshed perhaps in '13 or '14 MY. And, I assume the G's are due for a refresh in less than or equal to 24 months.Driving Audis, BMWs and Infinitis, I can tell you that the phrase Japanese BMW is an appropriate descriptive term for Infiniti. Infiniti seems to be striving for that certain something that makes a BMW stand out. Acura, based on my limited experience with the brand, on the other hand, seems to be -- sort of, kind of, er, a little bit like -- the Japanese Audi (from a few years ago) in that they don't hide their Honda-ness any better than Audi used to hide its VW parentage. If Acura were to ditch the Honda ""tells"" ASAP and make the Acura brand ""stand alone"" (as Audi has done from VW), they would be making great strides in establishing some kind of unique brand identity (which is largely lacking, currently.)Of course, it also wouldn't hurt one little bit if Acura would hire a designer or three away from one of the companies that make real purty 'sheens.Hardly the ""latest news"" since it is difficult to get news out of Infiniti from any reliable source, but, that's it!Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, etc.Drive it like you live. :shades: "

"sweendogy","December 2011"," billy your joking right?? 1) infiniti G was the class leader in hp when they redid it in 07.. 2 years later they blow out another 30 hp into the engine- they have added a sport package in 08 , new coupe they added in 08 - a convertable in 09, a cheaper G25 (which i hate) plus now the IS line - thats just the G we are talking about--lets not forget about adding the 7 speed transmission in 09 which acura just added a new transmission this year ... Infiniti made a gamble with the G and it turned out - Please look at acura sales numbers and tell me again they are not struggling..

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," After 11 months with an Infiniti product, I have become a believer that they are producing cars that do warrant consideration especially if your other choice is a BMW. Of course, this Great Recession may be partially the cause of my ""conversion."" Despite the fact that I find the G too small (narrow), I believe it to be a bargain when compared to a 3 series. Max one of the G37X's out and it is, perhaps, $45K. Content the 3 as close as possible to the G and the price will be a lot higher.BMW's are breathtakingly expensive to repair (and sometimes even maintain) after the 50,000 mile BMW bubble expires. The Infiniti we own -- FX35 -- seems to be pretty inexpensive to maintain, and the 7 speed transmission has been trouble free (and we are now at about 18K miles).Everyone here is certainly entitled to not find anything attractive about a given brand or model within the brand -- and that is fine. However, if you have not recently taken an Infiniti (or any other car listed here on the masthead) out for a long test-drive, it seems unlikely that you can make a factual statement about the brand or specific model.I know, for instance, that I have not driven a Lexus -- my opinion is that they are sofa's on wheels -- but that is only based on car magazine comments that I have read. I probably have my head up my nose in thinking that they are not ""performance"" cars. I plan to not opine any further on the brand since I know very little about them.I really don't care if anyone test drives an Infiniti or an Acura -- I do care, somewhat, if a specific model is criticized but never driven. I participate in these boards to learn and to share experiences and opinions.I do enjoy being regaled by owners' (or even car mavens who have tested so many cars it almost seems a career) stories about their experiences.Keep 'em coming!

They are nice cars, beautifully crafted, reliabile and a ton of tech.I, however, wanted more toward sporty aspirations. TL was too big, turning radius too big, not convinced of the value of SHAWD. G37 has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. I didn't even want to look at the TL 2012.As you aptly put it, outfit a 335 like a G37 and you are at $50 large.To each their own, everybody has their own priorities of what they want and/or dislike in a vehicle.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," OK guys, we've been doing a lot of bickering disagreeing on the board lately. Let's try something different. If you've got any kind of driving experience (whether via test drive or ownership) with one of the ELLPS cars share with the group. I'll go first. Go to the bathroom & set your DVR, this is going to be a decent sized post.Acura TSX: As you all know, I own a 2010 Acura TSX with Technology Package. It's the 2.4 L 4 cylinder mated to a 5 - Speed Automatic transmission. I originally bought the car for my wife when we had 2 kids and were 2 years into leasing a 2007 BMW X3. After 2 years we already had 38,000 miles on it (and were only alloted 45,000 for 3 years). On the last day of cash for clunkers I bought the TSX using a $3500 credit.I think the TSX is handsome. Not head turning gorgeous like a 911 Turbo or 458 Italia. I definitely don't think it's ugly.I like the engine/transmission combination. The engine winds all the way up to 7000 RPM very smoothly. Transmission shifts are crisp. The transmission will hold a gear and not upshift at the redline. I love the thickly bolstered seats & the well crafted interior. It rides fantastic. Comfortable, yet far from isolated. Handling for a FWD car is very good.My main gripes with the car are it's lifeless electric power steering and it's crummy, straight from an Accord brakes.Infiniti G37X: My Uncle had one and he let me drive it. I took it on a really nice, 45 minute drive. I came away extremely impressed with this car. kdshapiro hit the nail right on the head when he said: G37 has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. This car's 326 horsepower make it a bona fide road rocket. Handling is truly amazing. Excellent balance. I got in the car and found pefect seating right away. After 5 minutes, it felt like it was MINE. The car feels like it is turning on an axis. If it had gotten an EPA estimated 2 mpg more, I'd have one sitting in my drivewy right now. It didn't qualify for the $3500 C4C rebate though.Lexus IS 350: I drove one at a Lexus event when this body style came out in 2006. I happen to like the car's styling. The interior was well crafted and well thought out. Acceleration was blazingly quick. I thought the suspension was too isolated, the brakes were instant on and had no pedal feel to them at all. The back seat was tiny too (this coming from a guy who drives a Prelude).BMW E90 3 series: I have extensively driven an E90 328xiA & E90 335xiA. The 328xiA was my Mom's car that she leased for 3 years. Even the heaviest E90 sedan (AWD & Automatic) with the 240 hp NA I6 is a blast to drive. Handling was unbelieveable. The engine is so smooth. Brakes are fantastic. Very progressive and linear. I'm madly in love with this car. It is everything people rave about and more.I had a 335xiA as a loaner a few times. It's torque is seductive. Pulls like a small V8 rather than a turbo 6. Amazing car.My biggest gripes with the 3 series is its cramped back seat, small trunk, and hefty price. I know it is a BMW and you get what you pay for. flightnurse, you happened to find a ""perfect"" driver's car sitting on a lot and got a helluva deal on it. My Mom's was an '08 328xiA with premium, cold weather, automatic, metallic paint, parking sensors, & manual sunshades (no sport, nav, or comfort access). It stickered for over $46,000. It is very easy for a 335 to get in the $50K range.Questions? Comments? "
"billyperksii","December 2011"," Mark, I dont just blabber about a car and read some article in a magazine. I actually test drove the G35X for an extensive time. The salesperson actually gave me the keys and said have fun but be careful.I wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 TL Type S, the G just did not do it for me, I tried to force myself to like it but I just knew it would have been buyers remorse.Here are the deal breakers and I have said this many a times-1).Too cramp (mazda millennia interior size)2). Intrusive growl (could get annoying a long road trips)3). I just felt beat up after the test driveI have nothing against the brand, maybe the next generation G will sway me but from what I seen with the new styling cues on the M, G coupe and FX-I think I will step on my accelerator when I go by an Infiniti dealership. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Finally some substance. I agree the G could be a little cramped when compared to a TL or Buick- infact there have been complaints from bigger drivers that the cars seats are a problem. The growl is something that older folks have also complained about- the coupe does have a very intense growl when pushed in the city. The 07 and 08s sedans for sure also make sounds - this is something that can be heard when screeching from red light to red light bit not at 70mph on the highway- the newer g37 sedan has toned down the rear sound to make it more of a cruiser and to accommodate the older folks who complained. As I type Im getting ready for an 800 mile was coast tour which I'm dreading because we are not taking my g- we have to take my wifes cr-v because its roomier- the g is not a problem at all on long trips, I mean it's not a 89 covrvette - its a great highway cruiser when asked.Styling is subjective so can't argue.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," The original IS300 was a great 1st entry into this segment. Razor sharp handling & excellent brakes. It's 215 horsepower I6 was outgunned by the BMW E46 328i (and then by the 330i) and it got not so great fuel economy (and this is when gas was cheap). Lexus owners complained about the ""rough ride."". Lexus brought the car in to compete with BMW's E36, but the E46 was already on its way by the time the IS300 hit our shores. They brought brass knuckles to a gun fight.They brought the 300 hp IS 350 (automatic only). Toyota Corporate V6. 0-60 in the mid 5s instead of the low 7s. Brakes that provided excellent stopping distance, but with not much pedal feel. Lexus was very high on their 300 hp number vs. 255 in BMW's recently released E90 330i.I drove the Lexus IS350 back to back with a 330i at their event. The Lexus out accelerated the BMW, but just felt very artificial compared to the very athletic BMW.The IS250 had no power. The problem with the IS350 was that only a year after its release was sent packing by BMW's N54 twin turbo 300 hp I6. I think Lexus is waiting to see the next 3 series to finalize the next IS. They might just hit one out this time. "

When I was looking for a new 2005 ELLPS, I looked at the G35 along with the TL. The G35 was noticeably a bit narrow, but not a show stopper for me. I actually like a bit smaller cars. I thought the TL's interior was nicer. I drove the G35 and noticed the major power, along with a major growl. I didn't like the lack of refinement. The TL was smooth and quiet. I then drove the G35 on a transition ramp between two freeways that you can take at about 55mph. There is a perpendicular concrete seam with a bit of elevation difference on this ramp, so going over it, the car jolts a bit and it is on a fast curve. On the TL, the car was steady over the bump. On the G35, the steering wheel jerked pretty hard and I really had to be holding it tight or it would have jerked out of my hand. Not so on the TL. Based upon that experience, the TL won. I just turned 115K on my TL today, and I've only had to replace a window actuator along with normal maintenance and an outside air temp gauge recall. No other mechanical issues. "

"savetheland","December 2011"," All mainstream cars are pretty boring so I looked at premium sector. I can hardly call it luxury cars since any sub-prime mortgage holder can afford one, so if you are rich consider something different.BMW 3-series - the best engineer car in segment. Comfortable, crisp, precise, good steering ans so on. As some say - fits as a glove. The only problem I had with it - unnaturally heavy steering at parking lot speeds, compact size and small trunk. It is a personal performance sedan, not luxurious but worth every penny. It is more expensive than other cars because of engineering effort went into its design.CTS - pretty refined except of engine. Steering is the most balanced in the group, good handling and unlike Infinity - comfortable and is not cramped. Next choice it you do not want BMW.Infinity G-series - I felt like I do not belong to interior - difficult to find comfortable position. Good handling, good transmission and engine and steering is very good also but ride is too harsh. I felt like beaten up after test drive. If you are going to commute every day - it is not for you - you will get tired soon. Unlike BMW it achieved good handling not because of superior engineering but because of making it harsh. It might be more reliable though than both CTS and BMW.Buick Regal - steering is very light - like in Acura - but unlike Acura it is precise. Engine is week and interior is high quality but not luxurious. May be not as reliable as Acura though. But it is certainly better handler and has considerably better steering. Reliability might be a concern - it after all is a German car made by GM.TSX - steering is numb, numb, numb. I felt scary because lack of any feedback from steering wheel. Engine is certainly better than in Buick. Ride is comfortable but does not feel as solid as in Buick. Might be reliable though but keep it mind troublesome transmission - Honda is famous for engines but have problematic transmissions.MKZ - it is a Fusion. It feels like Fusion, looks like Fusion and has too many cheap bits in interior like Fusion. I did not insist in seriously testing it. I will wait to see new 2012 to make final judgement.Audi A4 - it is superior to both TSX and Regal and I suspect new Fusion/MKZ too. Has to buy AWD version to really enjoy it. But reliability over years proved to be disastrous. As with all VWs I know that after warranty expires there will be a lot of very expensive repairs. No matter how I like it and I always liked it very much - it is not practical car for working people who have to make living by commuting to work every day. It may work if you lease until warranty expires. I wish I was a rich dude, but I am not - my money are hard earned. BTW I would prefer Audi to BMW. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," Disagree on the g. While its not Lexus vault like, it's a very good commuter car. I drive less than stellar roads and feel perfectly comfortable in it. I do agree it drives like the tires are nailed to the road. "
"carnaught","December 2011"," I agree with your opinion and assessment of the Infiniti as a commuter car. Although reliable, it (G37 Coupe) was uncomfortable for me, and its boy-racer sounding engine and hard ride were tiring on a daily high mileage basis. (No offense to Infiniti enthusiats.) "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," Again the new 4 door g37 (non-sport) has been tamed a bit due to old folks making comment on its engine noise. At highway speeds under no duress it's as quiet as my moms accord. The 2 door I cannot speak of. This class is both Lux and performance- if you are looking for an entry level lux car that is quiet go with the Es350 or Acura Tl. Cars that are well built but for the most part won't excite you on the onramps. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," No offense taken. Different strokes for different folks. "
"savetheland","December 2011"," Accord is actually quite noisy. Better idea is to compare it with Cadillac and BMW - direct competition. I found G to be not as civilized as CTS or BMW. It is more in muscle car category. I forgot to mention Mercedes and Lexus, but those are off my list. I drove Mercedes E-class before and felt it to be too quiet and refined - not for me. I suspect Lexus is similar. Both Mercedes and Lexus are probably for very old folks (even though I am not a young dude). I mean they are what Lincoln and Caddie used to be. Most likely along with Toyota they will take replace of Lincoln, Buick and Cadillac as preferred transportation for retirees. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," The e class should be more refined - its a level up. I think you are on o something with the g - it does sound like it has more grunt because it does then the others in the conversation. The cts is a nice rig when given the big engine, lets not forget the V class, the 335 is the standard for sure- but throwing dollars in the conversation the muscle car can go toe to toe- dispite the louder notice going from standstill to 60 in under 5.5. Think about all the ear plugs you can buy for 10k, or better yet just turn up the Bose- the black keys sound terrific during those on ramp bursts "
"savetheland","December 2011"," C-class and Lexus IS are too compact for me to consider. And besides IS like Corolla and VW Beetle is driven mostly by ladies. I mean I would ignore car-for-ladies factor it if I liked it but I do not. Therefore E class and Lexus ES. But I cannot force myself to seriously consider ES and E-class is out of price range anyway. IMO Infinity G is for young people. When I was younger I cared about performance more than about comfort. But still premium car at least must be comfortable. "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," This class is not premium- its entry level - now if the criteria is lux, performance and price - hard to argue G vs any car here. Some are quieter, one is a better performer and few have the piece advantage "

"sweendogy","December 2011"," Thats fine I prefer performance and 10k (if looking at a 2011 335 comparison) .

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," My experience exactly -- so far, nothing beats the German car driving experience within the $40K - $55K price range. And, come to think of it my one and only Audi A8 (which was north of $55K by a five figure number) would be my preference over any Lexus, too.My friend's 5 series came off lease. He looked at a new BMW (5 series, I presume); he seems to have the money to get what he wants (within reason), he got a new Genesis sedan (which I have sat in but not driven). I am not sure if he will get another Genesis next time, but so far he thinks it was a great value and at least a very good (if not great) car.Although the exterior look is somewhat derivative, the interior is a great interpretation of lux from any country. The transmission has 8 cogs and he claims tons of power.I think he said the lease turned out to be $299 per month (wow!)Anyway MY point is to agree that, so far, the Germans make the best car if driving is of interest to you. "
"flightnurse","December 2011"," Interesting that you talk about the Genesis, I travel for work a lot, and the only company I rent from is National, I have Emerald Club Executive Elite status with them, on my last rental with them in Indy I was able to get a Genesis, I was highly impressed with the car, it was quite, road well, very comfortable car, however the over all experience was just bland no personality to it at all, which is typical for an Asian car. I have seen the Genesis Spec R which would be a great car however the reviews continue to day, not sporty enough. Jan 3rd I'm back in Indy again and will try and get the Infiniti M37X. "

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," I have to assume that AWD is in the Genesis pipeline. I suspect they need another year or two to refine their ""house made"" 8-spd transmission. From what I read it is a notch lower in refinement to the ones used by Audi and BMW.BTW, is it true that Infiniti sources its 7-spd from Mercedes? And, is it true that the first year the 7-spd had some software problems but that they have since been corrected?Our late 2010 build 2011 FX35 AWD has the 7-spd and it has presented zero problems and zero recalls in 18,000+ miles. The only thing I do notice about the FX35's ""character"" is that the engine makes coarser sounds than the Acura 3.7L engine, but this trait is really only evident at very high RPM's and/or when the accelerator is floored. It should be improved by Infiniti, no doubt, as the Infiniti engine refinement is not quite up to Audi, BMW or even, Honda, er Acura smoooothness. "
"kdshapiro","December 2011"," To me it doesn't matter how the engine sounds at wot. The G37 will almost beat the 335 and is a rocket. For $45K if one stays away from the coupe models, you can get a fully loaded vehicle for a family of two is big enough for most occasions. (The occasions it's not big enough, neither is the Audi or Acura either)A 335 will cost $50K+ for the same equipment level. Having said that I don't think I would necessarily buy a fully loaded 335, but there are those who compare feature to feature. "

If the G37 sounded like a turbine powered sewing-machine at WOT, nobody would mention it.And your power argument only holds sway if you value being 0.2 or 0.3 secs faster than the Volvo or Acura next to you at a stoplight (of course, if the road is wet, that's a different story, huh?). In the real world, on real roads, the difference in power is insignificant.Again, it's not my intention to bash the G37 - it's a great car. For the shopper who values bang for the buck and doesn't mind a little roughness around the edges, it's a terrific value in the segment. But for many buyers, regardless of features, the fact that the G37 doesn't do luxury as well as some of the other cars here is a deal breaker.

Woah, what a nice car!It's not a sporty sedan so it doesn't qualify for this segment, but it's not bad. It feels nimble and corners pretty flat but the steering is numb. The VR6 has serious guts though, without significant torque steer. It's also got a beautiful, elegant, simple, airy cabin with a very high quality leatherette (!) interior and a well designed touch-screen infotainment system. The cockpit compares well with the best of this segment, and the back seat is huge with unbelievable legroom and a cavernous trunk.MSRP was $29,000 for the V6 with sunroof, and it comes with pretty much all the features anyone would want. I honestly would have a hard time justifying spending $10K more for one of the subjects of this thread. I'm not ready to buy yet, but I was sorely tempted to take it home.

So, how is it on me that Infiniti bundles key features within bloated and overpriced packages? They do it on purpose to FORCE the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they don't want. Do you think it's an accident that in order to get the Sport Package, you also have to order the Navigation Package? That's $4000 for a laundry list of stuff you probably don't need and wouldn't have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your G37 to handle and stop a little better. :confuse: So, if I were to buy a G37, I would have to pass on the Sport Package and simply get the Journey + Premium Package for $39,245. That's only $2000 less than the Mercedes. Every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the G37 (which is it's strongest asset) has been significantly diminished.So how did this happen? Mercedes offers the C350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. This serves the customer - if the customer doesn't want leather or 18"" wheels, they don't have to buy them. Yes, if you want metallic paint on a European car, you have to pay for it, but at least you don't have to order the Shiatsu Massage and Curb Feeler Packages to get it.And enough with the annoying ""left lane"" remark. In this era of 300 hp family cars and 400 hp pony cars, 328 hp is nothing to brag about. If you really spend that much time in the left lane, I hope you have the decency to check your rearview mirror often. :P "
"sweendogy","December 2011"," guess im in the spin zone.. only 2k less- well yes lawman-(after you option them out the way you want it,)- its 2k less but again i guess i get the leather, the standard keyless start and yes the 700 paint job for free as well-- do i guess the spread is a little more then the 2k you speak of=- o wait i also get xenon lights which are standard on most as well.. please spare me on the ala cart stuff as if you add them up - you want leather well that will cost you, you forgot your previous arguement when you said the G fails to give standard features -- you want paint, you want leather, you want keyless start..your value being diminished is a joke- dollar for dollar-- its 7k in savings as equiped-- hello - thats some decent coin.

"tlong","December 2011"," I also found this interesting post courtesy Google:""In almost every comparison test where there has been a G35 tested against the E46 3 series, it has lost. You stick to thinking that your mad horzepowerz yo! is where it's at. All I gotta say is, I regret not test driving a 328 before I got my G37. I test drove the 335, and that car was utterly amazing, but for an extra 12k more, I decided to stick with the Infiniti. I got my bike for my speed fix. And that is what I should have thought about when I was buying the car. I thought the 328 would be disappointing after the 335 and the G37, but I was wrong. I test drove one a year after I got my G37 and the car drives amazing. The engine feels a million times smoother than the VQ and the throttle is not as abrupt. The clutch is a million times better. It absorbs bumps and imperfections on the road better as well. Other than the obvious lack of horsepower, which any adult really would not miss nor exploit on regular roads, the BMW, in any range of the 3 series, is a dynamically better car.Every time a comparison is done, same complaints come up for the Infinitis....too much NVH from the engine, disconnected steering, non linear braking, poor clutch engagement...and what do they do every year? Up the horsepower....go figure. And they do aim it at a certain audience that buys into it that believes that horsepower matter more than anything else."" "

"dino001","December 2011"," MB and BMW are more expensive for comparable equipment. One could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to G or TL, as long as they can let go some of those luxuries. However, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and C-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon). There is really no excuse for that - 12K Kia and Hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse. It's all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" BS. I know, I have 328 - fortunately it's a wagon, so it has folding seats and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. What makes it worse, I see dealers actually ordering those without folding seats in large numbers. I can only imagine a brand new owner of 50K 335 trying to fold his/her seats and discovering the car doesn't have it. :sick: :lemon: On many other options, I'm more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling). I tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or variable speed steering), but bundling sports package with Nav is a little too much, even if I would order both anyway. To me it's OK to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all tech, or all sports. But cross-bundling does sound a little like making a run on customer's wallet, even if some customers would take them both. For value-oriented people probably nothing beats Acura - you get everything except Nav/technology. I like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose :lemon:. We still don't have it so bad here - you would have to see a price sheet on BMW in Europe - it's actually a book!!! Proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional. Of course, they also have three times as many engine versions, which creates many more permutations, but that's a different story entirely. Not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50K+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there). "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," FWIW, I don't have a personal stake or emotions tied to this discussion because I don't own any of the cars in this segment. Also, I can research (and maybe eventually purchase) a boring Passat or Subaru Outback for my wife without craving more excitement because I already own an honest sports car that gives me more driving and ownership pleasure than any car in this segment ever could.M-B C350 Standard features missing on the G37 Journey:*Sport suspension with electronic control adaptive dampers*Adaptive brakes with predictive brake priming, auto brake drying, and hill start assist*14 way power driver seat with power lumbar adjust*Power steering column*Driver memory with settings for seat, mirrors, and steering column*Auto dim rearview and driver outside mirror*Moonroof*Wood trim accents*Rain sensing automatic wipers*Split-fold rear seats*Harman Kardan Logic 7 450 Watt audio*9 airbags including pelvis and knee airbags*Attention Assist to detect driver drowsinessG37 Journey standard features missing on the C350:*Xenon headlamps*Leather seats*Keyless start*Free metallic paintPlease let me know if I've missed anything... So, my assertion that the G37 lacks quite a few features seems to be valid. But more importantly, did you notice that most of the C350 features are performance or safety related while the G37 features are basically fluff? But to even things up as accurately as possible, let's load them both up as closely as we can...So, a C350 with added Xenon headlamps, leather seats, Navigation, metallic paint, 18"" wheels, and Keyless Start costs $46,440.Now, a G37 Journey with wood trim, Premium Package, Navigation Package, and Sport Package costs $45,045.It looks like the Mercedes is $1400 more expensive than the G37. But the G37 still lacks electronic adaptive suspension, adaptive brakes, and attention assist. Also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams, curve assist and headlamp washers, split-fold rear seats, knee and pelvis airbags, and rain-sensing wipers.The C350 lacks DVD playback, Zagat Restaurant Guide, aluminum pedals, magnesium shift paddles, and a Viscous Limited Slip.Draw your own conclusions - I'm exhausted... :sick: "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," I discovered an error in my research. I'm not sure what I did, but the above described C350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440. (Edit: the $1750 leather seats didn't get added in)I also just noticed that when I added the wood trim to the G37, it automatically added the $1200 Technology Package, which includes rain-sensing wipers and pre-crash seatbelts. Since these are standard features on the C350, this doesn't change the math in my previous post.The increase in the price of the C350 raises the gap between the Merc and Infiniti up to about $3150.However, something else occurred to me... Take the well equipped C350 described above and remove the metallic paint ($720), 18"" wheels ($1040), and leather interior ($1750) - options which affect appearance only (barely, if at all) and have no effect on performance, comfort, safety, or functionality.The same C350 now costs $44,680 - a savings of $3500!Now do the same thing with the above described G37 and remove the wood trim...oh wait, the Technology Package requires the wood trim. OK, lets remove the 18"" wheels...nope, they're part of the Sport Package that includes the upgraded suspension. Leather seats are standard, so that's not an option. OK, I hate to lose it, but what about the moonroof? Sorry, it's part of the Premium Package which includes driver memory settings and Bose premium audio.The C350 now costs $350 less than the G37.

I would never actually buy one though - too much technology to fail a few years down the road and too expensive to fix.I am excited about the upcoming 328i though. I've never really liked the E90, but this F30, with significantly more power (torque!) and less weight, has the potential to be a real game changer. I predict it will steal a lot of 335i sales and be THE sales and value leader in this segment. I also think it's much better looking than the E90. And following current industry trends, it should also be less expensive than the E90.

"markcincinnati","January 2012"," Maybe it is just the congestion caused by all the high-school and college students home for the break, but here in our somewhat small city, Cincinnati, it is approaching impossible to be able to actually DRIVE (meaning the car is moving at a speed higher than 20MPH) unless one seeks a rural route.Now, me, I go to and from work 5 days per week, travel the 200 mi RT between Cincinnati and Columbus once per week and sleep late the other day. I do not (and really don't plan to) ""track"" my car (never have).So I go through German and now Japanese ""luxury performance sedans"" one after another -- ordering upsized wheels/tires, sport packages, sport seats, sport suspensions, whatever has sport in it. I used to fight the good fight and order cars specifically so that I could get manual shifters. I chipped my turbo cars, changed out the air filters and BPV's to squeeze out any additional power I could (from the turbo's of course).For what?A quick dash to 35MPH, before I had to abruptly mash the brake pedal or rear end the guy parked on the highway in front of me! That's what.I read the reviews of the new BMW 328 (with the turbo 4), and I really got excited (for about 9 minutes) when I saw the acceleration figures -- but then I thought, ""I probably can't even use that much power on the entrance ramp to I-71S"" (I'd rear end someone.)Nevertheless I continue to want more -- I want my cars to be ever quicker (they're already fast, even the puny ones can go 130MPH, which is where many of the Germans place the ""limiter"") even though it is hard to imagine regularly (or frequently) being able to enjoy the ever quickening acceleration from the Americans, Europeans and the Japanese.I want ever larger and sticky-er tires, firmly sprung and electronically controlled suspensions, the whole enchilada -- and for what, the one time I can carve that corner (without fear of hitting a deer in the headlights -- literally Bambi.)I have become irrational about the performance -- I want more more more, whereas traffic and circumstances of urbania and even sub-urbania allow less less less -- of the cars I drive. Perhaps that is why my fondest memory (and my all-time favorite car) is of a 1995 Audi S6. At least, way back then, I could actually slip the car into first gear and rapidly release the clutch and floor the accelerator without rear-ending the guy in front of me being my first and foremost thought.Now I am driving a car that is as fast as any on this board and faster than many. Moreover, the thing is capable of holding its own in quickness too. Good luck in being able to actually enjoy the performance.Yet, with 31 months to go on the lease, I am wondering -- what will be quicker, sticky-er and have more technology next time?Completely irrational.I'm thinkin' the evolution of the new BMW 3 (in the next 30 months) or the G from Infiniti (and possibly another Acura) or maybe back to my old love, Audi will provide more more more. By then, however, I'd imagine that an occasional sprint to 55 or 60 will seem ""freakin' awesome!""Drive it like you live (or rather, as you would like to live). :confuse: "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," Mark, great post (as usual). We're all in the same boat, but we're enthusiasts so we want the potential, even if we can't use it.We live for the occasional empty decreasing radius onramp (and we know where all of them are located within 12 miles of home), and we want to have the torque to squirt through a gap in traffic when we're stuck behind a LLC. Like owning a jetski or an airplane - we can't use it all the time, but when we do, it's a blast.But your reasoning is sound. That's why I would even entertain the option of owning a Passat or Subaru - ELLPS power and cockpit, but without the brand cache and chassis prowess that I can't use.BTW, my company car is a Chevy Malibu, so M-F, onramps and the occasional bare stretch of road don't have anything to offer me but temptation. When I'm on my commute and happen to see someone in a 993 or worse, an E30, it just makes me wish I was in my personal car...which I do drive to work occasionally just for the fun of it. "

Yes I have attended a few HPDE's, last one was at Firebird (which BTW isn't my fave track) but its a blast to be able to get the 330 sideways without worrying about the local police. "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," Very cool Flightnurse. It's great that you have owned the cars you wanted to own (and bikes too!). I love the NSX - looks and performance still hold up. I see one on the road every now and then. Another car I love seeing but is pretty rare now is the 300ZX twin turbo. Not an NSX, but someone in my neighborhood has a cherry one and my heart skips a beat whenever I see it. I went through a bike phase (Honda Hurricane 600) when I was in the Army. Then when I lived in L.A., my friends and I used to ride Mulholland and go to the Rock Store. I was a pretty good rider at 8/10ths, but I never got good enough or brave enough to go faster. I got hit by a car in 1990, sold the bike for parts, and never rode again. "
"busiris","January 2012"," Sorry I was late to the party, but my special order experiences mirror those of NYC and Shipo.Often, it's actually cheaper for a dealer to sell the same car special order .vs. from stock, as the dealership has no $$$ directly tied up in the special order vehicle, as he may have in one on the floor.IMO, I have always done better negotiating for a special order than a floor model. Obviously, the dealer understands you are more educated about the potential vehicle, and that you are less willing to settle for something less than what you want.The big drawback, of course, is the waiting period, and the uncertainty of the trade in value at the time of actual delivery. "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," Ordering a car is ""always"" less money than buying one in inventory.Why?#1 Dealer has a buyer and will not have any cost of borrowing or at most a very small cost of borrowing -- meaning the discount can be larger (""can be"" doesn't always mean ""will be,"" but hopefully you get the point.)#2 Many of the LPS and ELLPS cars are ""on allocation"" -- as it was explained to me, ""the more cars I sell, the more cars I can get."" So, your order will potentially increase the total number of cars the dealer will be able to get, especially if the brand is from Europe, more specifically Germany.Dealers love ordered cars -- I would bet, overall, that dealers would love to have only demo's in stock and have 50 or 60 cars on order every month. As far as I know, this is the way it is done in Germany (mostly). You research your car, you go to the dealer who has a demo -- if you like it you order it.No instant gratification, but the buyer gets EXACTLY what he/she wants, not ""close enough for jazz"" as we do in the US.I wanted a pearl white TL (check).I wanted it with the Umber leather (apparently not possible this year and not even possible as a custom order like the Germans allow -- for $2,500 over the normal cost).I accepted Pearl White with a Black Leather interior.

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," Excellent posts guys.How fast can we really go on our public roads? How much power do we really need? We're car enthusiasts & that's what we want.I live in Connecticut & Commute to The Bronx 6 days a week. The roads I drive on have mostly 50 mph (in NYC) & 55 mph (Westchester & CT). There's even a 3 lane (each way) parkway I take sometimes with a 45 mph speed limit! 2 of my cars (Prelude & TSX) have 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engines. Guess what? I seriously have trouble keeping the speedos under 80. If I slide my TSX shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.I've got my Prelude Type SH as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance ramp attacking, awesome handling, stick shift car that I drive to work once a week now.The TSX is my daily driver. As much as I love driving my Prelude, the thickly bolstered, heated leather seats, automatic climate control, & bluetooth, & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic. My wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids. She prefers driving the TSX solo as opposed to her 2011 Pilot which she chauffers the kids around in all week. It is nice to have 2 automatic transmission cars.I do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different cars in this class. No way would I even consider a G25X, only a Sport/Nav/Premium G37X. With a BMW, the only way I could even think of affording a 335Xi is if it is a CPO car. Then I'd have to really think, is it really worth it to get this CPO 335xi over a brand new optioned as I want 328xi? With the upcoming 320i w/ X drive 328i 2.0L Turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of torque & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.When the time comes, I'd have to check out the C350 as well. Who knows, BMW may have botched the electric power steering (it is LIFELESS in my TSX)? Maybe MBs 7 speed auto transmission & 3.5 L V6 would be a better fit for my daily commute. I might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too. MBUSA's headquarters (as well as BMWUSA's) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an MB Executive Demo car that's RWD instead of the run-of-the mill C300 4Matics that every dealership stocks. Maybe if I LOVE the Mercedes that much, I could live with a RWD car in CT. I'd be willing to live with MB Text instead of the full leather.There's been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the G37's engine. Fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their G37 Sedan.It is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their cars & have been to driving schools too.

"dino001","January 2012"," It is funny, because the dealers would make you believe they're doing you such a favor by ordering a car the way you want it. Germans aren't so bad, but they always start their negotiations from ""if it's an order, it'll be at sticker"", like it was a rule or something. Even though, as you mentioned, an ordered car is lower cost to them, they want actually a larger profit on it. Classic reverse psychology: you came it, you want it just like it, you must be very motivated, so I'm charging you for that desire - if you walk away, no harm done to my bottom line, yet, as long as there are enough people to come and get something else. On the other hand, the one on my lot is sitting there, if you walk away, I'm still having a car to sell, so I better price it to sell now. It's all instant gratification. When I ordered my 328i SportsWagon for ED followed by Performance Center delivery (yes, you can combine the two), many people at work could not understand why I would wait for a car for four month, just to get it right. Isn't that easier to go there and just get a red one off the lot? They're asking. Well, yes, but to me a deal on something you don't really want is not a deal at all. "
"markcincinnati","January 2012"," I have been to three Audi (in Seefeld Austria) driving schools and one BMW driving school (here in the US in South Carolina). Both schools teach you how to brake, steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at speeds faster than you are probably able to imagine yourself going ""comfortably.""I drive my 305HP TL so slowly on Interstate 71S on the way to downtown Cincinnati, I rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.We had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our State Highway Patrolman du jour about how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the Audi and BMW driving schools even if they never use that term). The first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is NOT equipped with ABS (or stability control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in braking with ABS vs non-ABS, the interview was cut short.As I watched this interview unfold, I grew angry since the response from the cop was to NOT press hard on the brakes without ABS and I knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have ABS . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your brakes with maximum pressure on the brake pedal.""If anyone was about 75% paying attention, I would think they would press on their ABS equipped car's brake pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal. Of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!What is the % of ABS equipped cars? I've had it in all my cars since 2000 for pity's sake -- 11+ years.Why not talk about getting out and cranking the engine with the hand crank?Oh crap, I'm way off topic.Hmmm, let's see -- OK, I've got it.All ELLPS and LPS (and most other cars on the market today) have BOTH ABS and Electronic Stability Control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!Whew, hopefully I saved it. Sorry for going off track. I panicked.Burma. :blush: "
"busiris","January 2012"," I live less than 10 miles from the BMW Performance Center and have been on their track many times.I agree with your comments about confusing the drivers about braking practices.Its one of the 1st things you're taught by the Performance Center trainers when you pick up your new BMW car there, and I would guess well over 75% start out the day not knowing the proper procedure for braking in wet/icy conditions.BTW, I never tire of spinning out on the skid-pad at the Performance Center track....

"rayainsw","January 2012"," Long post &#150; fair warning . . .I do recognize that even a quarter mile blast [ to well over 100 MPH from a standing start, in my current BMW 3 ] is something I am unlikely to do anytime soon &#150; or anywhere but a race track. However, I use [ and I appreciate ] the ability to gain speed when I want or need to. The deep well of Torque available at most any RPM, in any gear, allows acceleration with a degree of ease, an effortless surge that I find quite satisfying. Though I relish those occasions when I can apply WOT for more than a few seconds, I also appreciate the times where much less than full throttle accomplishes the task at hand [ passing, merging, etc. ] with no flash or drama. There is [ to me ] a strong feeling that this car [ in some ways like the Corvette I drove for over 2 years ] will do anything asked &#150; all day long &#150; and accomplish the assigned tasks without breaking a sweat.This applies to the handling, as well. Though I never purposely approach 10/10 in my [ street ] driving, the feeling of precision and my sense that there is capacity well beyond what I will intentionally use results in a level of security that I value. Within the performance envelope I use, this feeling that I am always well inside the car&#146;s limits is of value &#150; to me.So &#150; in addition to the quantifiable performance aspects [ acceleration rate, cornering Gs, etc. ], for me, that feeling or sense of capacity beyond what I can comfortably tap in my typical driving is one reason that I am willing to pay the price for something like the BMW 3.I use the aspects of the performance that I think I prudently can, when and where I can &#150; and this other &#145;sense - touchy, feely&#146; stuff sustains me from one such occasion to the next. And helps keep my frustration in check.- RayHappy BMW customer . . . "
"flightnurse","January 2012"," Mark for me its not how fast I can drive my cars, but the pleasure it brings. For me, the BMW 3 series is a complete car, the seating position, the shifter, the feel of the car when driving. Can't get that with the G or the M (I currently have a M37X as a rental), Audi comes close, MB does have it. There are a couple of off amps and on ramps that really brings a smile to my face in Phoenix. "
"flightnurse","January 2012"," NyCarguy BMW CPO is truly the best way to get your BMW, it comes with an extended warranty and you should be able to get the BMW with more equipment then you want for the same price. "
"sweendogy","January 2012"," Off and on ramps are straights - best left to cars that get up and go. The g and the M do have that. "
"nyccarguy","January 2012"," I plan on waiting until my TSX is paid off and beyond anyway, but will definitely entertain the idea of a CPO F30 328i w/ XDrive when the time comes.I too love pretty much everything about the current E90 3, including all the little details you listed. It is just too small for my needs. With 3 young children, in addition to wonderful driving dynamics & rapid acceleration, I need a decent sized trunk & a spacious interior. A stroller would take up 90% of the trunk space in an E90. A child safety seat attached forward facing in the rear of the car literally touches the ceiling. A rear facing infant seat would render the front passenger seat useless.We had an '07 X3. It had tons of rear seat room for child safety seats (forward or rear facing) without impeding on the comfort of the front passenger. Reliability wise, the car was perfect. Only went to the dealer for scheduled service visits & 1 other time. With 42,000 miles (3,000 shy of lease allotment), my wife swerved to avoid some debris in the road and whacked a center median high curb. She took out 2 tires and a wheel. She also needed an alignment to go with it. The service advisor told me that the 2 remaining tires wouldn't pass BMW lease end inspection and that I should replace them. I also callled him at 11:30 am, arrived with the X3 on a flatbed by 12:45 pm, and there was a loaner warmed up & ready to roll for me.I should have bought the X3 at its lease end with it's brand new tires and stellar reliabiliy record. Plus I LOVED driving it. I had the TSX which was just a year old with 17,000 miles for it that I didn't want to get killed as far as depreciation goes, then take out a loan on a 3 year old BMW with 46,000 miles. I had just taken a bath selling my apartment and had bought a house so I figured keeping the Acura was a safe bet. Plus I wasn't thrilled with the X3's cargo room. The Acura actually has a longer & wider trunk.Like I've said before, I like the TSX. A lot. It just isn't a car I picked out to be my daily driver. I inherited it from my wife after we found out we were expecting our 3rd child and bought her a Pilot. When the time comes to replace the TSX, I'm most certainly going to replace it with a BMW. "

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," shipo: My Aunt & Uncle live in Southern, NH (Salem), very close to you. You also know I have a tremendous amount of respect for your opinion and vast knowledge, especially when it comes to all things automotive. You guys get some serious snow. Much more than we do here in Stamford, CT. I've lived in NY all my life (Rockland, Ithaca, Manhattan, Westchester) and much like MA & NH, they plow & salt. Early and often. I thought the weather here in Stamford would be exactly the same as in Southern Westchester (Hartsdale, White Plains) where I had moved from. I was very much mistaken. Now I will admit that we had a ""bad winter"" last year as far as snowfall goes. Here in Stamford, I live off The Merrit Parkway and many people have well water, so they DO NOT salt the roads. They also don't send the plows out like they do in NY. I've got to be at work at 7:30 AM. That means leaving at 6:30 on normal days and between 6:00 & 6:15 when it snows. Last year I saw a few times that they had done a few passes on The Merrit, but didn't plow the entrance/exit ramps. I actually followed a plow on the the parkway thinking I'd be able to get off at the next exit and turn around. Well, I had to drive 10 miles North to Norwalk before I could turn around and come back south. This was all in my 2001 Honda Prelude equipped with a set of Michelin Pilot Arctic Alpin winter tires. I think AWD with a set of 4 snow tires would have helped me plow through some of those unplowed on ramps and made my life easier.For years I thought AWD/4WD was not needed in the ""tri-state"" area. That RWD and a set of winter tires would be all my whatever bmw I was building online would need. AWD adds weight & cost. It hampers fuel economy & performance for the other 355 days a year that it doesn't snow. AWD helps you start, but the added weight can be your enemy trying to swerve around something and increased your stopping distance. After spending 1 (bad) winter here in Stamford (southwestern CT for those who are unfamiliar with the area), my tune has changed.I equip my FWD Acura TSX with 4 Michelin Pilot Arctic Alpin winter tires. My next car will hopefully be a BMW. I'd love an X1 (gas or diesel), a CPO X3 (N55 Turbo), or an F30 328i w/ X drive. "

"dino001","January 2012"," Diesels feel quick until you reach the revvs above the band and it ""dies"" very quickly. This means you have to shift a lot very precise shift points - this will impact acceleration number like 0-60.

"markcincinnati","January 2012"," I loved your post, but I must take exception to something kind of buried in your prose, to wit:""It hampers fuel economy & performance. . ."" I don't really want to get into a discussion about the merits of AWD vs RWD or FWD or the difference between 2 driven and 4 driven wheels -- however, therefore, notwithstanding (and any other lawyer-ly sounding thing), I do agree that AWD done poorly can hamper performance. I agree that typically (meaning virtually always in fact) the added weight of AWD does decrease fuel mileage.Yet we don't live (or at least most of us don't live) in a perfect world with respect to driving -- if we did, I suspect virtually everyone would agree that RWD at least ought to be the best.Assuming we all accept the premise that our driving world is imperfect, I would submit that AWD generally speaking (and with the qualifier that I am speaking about AWD done well, such as by Audi, BMW and Infiniti, wherein the AWD is rear biased and may include torque vectoring or what is sometimes called a sport differential) performs better in the real world.My premise is that AWD is not just about driving in the snow and on other low coefficient of friction surfaces.We can, if you like, agree to disagree and be done with it -- I just couldn't let the ""hampers performance"" remark stand since it seems too broad and perhaps would lead a newcomer to this forum to come to believe that only RWD is good and AWD sucks gas and decreases performance. For a lot of folks, even in warmer areas of the country, AWD means the potential for greater perfomance in everyday driving circumstances. Drive it like you live. :shades: "

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," Ok all my friends out there who track their cars on a regular basis or have driven cars on a track. I understand the basic idea of why RWD rocks (especially on the track). The front wheels steer the car while the rear wheels drive the car. RWD is lighter and less complex. You can oversteer the car if you want to. How does the AWD car have such an advantage if it is heavier and has a tendency to understeer (although not as much as a FWD car)? I also know there are different types of AWD systems out there. BMW's X Drive is RWD based, Subaru's Symmetrical AWD (50/50 Split with a WRX Manual Transmission), Audi has 2 types of quattro (50/50 & the Rear Biased in their performance models). "
