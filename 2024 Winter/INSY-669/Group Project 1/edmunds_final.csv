"primetime79","May 2006"," let me preface my post by unequivocally stating the mere fa cadillac . i am not an automobile professional. i have no loyalty to any automobile manufacturer. i enjoy a exhilirating driving experience.three years ago (2003), i was in the market for a sedan that had a certain level of sport and  comfort . i narrowed my search to four  car . 1.) bmw 330i 2.) audi  audi  1.8t 3.) lexus is 300 4.) infinity g 35 . quickly this search was down to two as the lexus is 300 had   safety  olutely nothing to offer in the form a  comfort  offering and the infinity was much of the same although not to lexus extreme. the ""feel"" of the steering wheel and all other components of the inifity made it quite apparent that the build quality of this car was not up to par. so it was down to two  car , the bmw 330i and the audi  audi  1.8t. the 330i was much   performance  er than the  audi , but to me it lacked the    performance    prowlness of the  audi . maybe it's me, but the 330i was not impressive at all. i felt like it was a regular family sedan. i have nothing against bmw, but sometimes i wonder if sometimes their maybe a lit acura e bit of brainwashing or speaking something to ex toyota ent, with the over hyped driving (   performance   ) experience. for me it came down to the getting the best car for me. the  audi  exemplified te best    performance    (feedback), the best   design  . the build quality on this car was impeccable. unfortunately due to circumstance beyond my control (wife) i had to trade in my audi a year ago for a suv.   performance   forward to the present, and i have been blessed to make the same purchase decision again. again it came down to the eact same 4  car  with a lit acura e thought given to the acura  acura . but after a close up encounter with the  acura  , while the car is a phenomenal value it was apparent is was nothing more than that a ""phenomenal value"". so i test drove the same 4  car  again. the infinity now with the  infiniti  was a nice car but lacked in the same area   design   refinement and the short throw clutch felt like my brothers 95 mitsubishi eclipse (cheap). next on the l toyota  was the audi. the new audi  audi  had undergone some minor changes most notably hp improvement. overall the car was better than the one i once had, but suprisingly was 6k more similiarly equipped. this posed a problem. it was then down to two  car  the is 350 and the 330i. lots of people do not like the new 330i   design  . but i think while it may not be a sporty as the is per se, it is definielty more profounding and un toyota ue. as usual when i went for my test drive of the bmw i walked into the dealership and was treated as an outkast. i guess this car either sells itself, or i did not   design   like the typical bmw client ready to make a purchase. in my usual car shopping attire i wore shorts, flip flops and a white wife-beater shirt with my bling bling on. finally someone came to help me and i was in the bmw 330i. first glance of the 330i   design   i did know what to think. after 30 seconds of   design  ing at it, this understated   design   started   design  ing growingly bland. once on the road, i could not figure out what all this hoopla was about. immediately i went straight to lexus dealership to figure out what changes lexus made to the is. at first glance i fell in love with it's beauty. i then told the sales person order me a black on black with navi, but it has to be manual. it was at that time my heart was broken. no manual for 350. never had i ever thought, i would own a sports/ comfort  car that was not manual. but the sales person was adamant that i at least try it out. the rest is h toyota ory. i am a proud owner of a is 350 crystal white navi. this car is not only super quick but handles excellent. i have driven it several times with the vdim off and it makes a huge difference. around corners with the vdim on it cuts the throt acura e to quickly. i must advise the average driver to be careful, because this is a rwd car and they tend to spin out rather quickly. but after two weeks of owning it i am extremely ecstatic about my decision. i personally think bmw might be overhyped, audi are under  performance  ed, infiiniti are built with less   design   refinement and overall build quailty. lexus is 350 for me at least is the perfect blend, if you do not want to buy the car do not test drive it!!!!!!!!!p.s sorry i am a lit acura e long winded "
"pgsmith","May 2006"," my experience @ bmw was similar. obviously i did not conform to their image of a bmw owner having worn a t-shirt and shorts into their showroom. they wasted no time in  buick ing stories of who they knew when i explained where i worked (ho-hum, i was there to see the vehicles). after we spent (too much) time in the the salesman's cubicle, i learned they did not have a car with the equipment they learned i might be wanting, but they would happily order it for me.i  toyota d great, but i wanted to actually drive a car to see if the car was really what i would like. i was told that:1. they did not even have a car that had an automatic (wife's requirement, not mine) i could test drive (which i saw later the same day on the lot). :confuse: 2. they would not let me test drive a red car since i was not interested in red and that would put miles on a car someone else would buy. :confuse:3. they had a blue one waiting to be prepped. when i indicated that it might be ok to accept blue, the vehicle was not prepped even within a week, at which point i had to ""make them"" let me test drive the red one. :confuse: end results:1. i was offended by their arrogance. :mad: 2. i was not very impressed by the vehicle.3. i bought a competitors vehicle (c280), which i am happy with.4. i will continue to vehicle shop in the future in shorts, jeans, t-shirts, flip-flops, running shoes, as this will help me decide about they ability of the dealership to be confident in the car not try to sell the ""image"".5. i will leave immediately any dealer who gives me this type of treatment in the future.

"redsoxgirl","May 2006"," i respect your right to have the opinion that the is350 is the right car for you, but i strongly disagee that it is even close to the ""best  comfort /sport sedan"" on any objective basis.clearly you have a different definition of ""sport"" than i do as it pertains to how a car accelerates, handles, steers,    safety   , performs - as well as how connected to the road and driver it is. as evidence:the 330i was much   performance  er than the  audi , but to me it lacked the    performance    prowlness of the  audi .how anyone could conclude the ""   performance    prowess"" of a 60/40 imbalanced fwd  audi  is superior to that of the 50/50 balanced rwd 330i is an enigma. are you sure you weren't overly enamored with the   design   of the  audi  to forget to put it through a serious test drive against the 330i? never had i ever thought, i would own a sports/ comfort  car that was not manual. but the sales person was adamant that i at least try it out. the rest is h toyota ory.again, perhaps having come out of a 170 hp  audi , you were enamored with the 300+ hp is350. but that automatic transmission removes any ""sport"" there might have been in the car for me. sorry, drag racing doesn't fit my driving   design  . i have never owned a bmw and i am not sure i ever will. but in searching for a compact to mid size sport sedan to replace my boxster s this fall, the is350 doesn't make the long l toyota , let alone the short l toyota  on the ""sport"" criteria. great lit acura e  comfort  car, perhaps. true sport sedan compared to the  bmw , no way. at least not for me.

"primetime79","May 2006"," just ought of curiousity. have you ever test driven the is 350 before. because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter  comfort . the car has excellent steering feel. my only complaint is the vdim killing the throt acura e to early when the wheel starts losing    safety   . i guess i am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the is wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the bmw handles/feels/   safety    better and declare them a winner.

"redsoxgirl","May 2006"," just ought of curiousity. have you ever test driven the is 350 before. because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter  comfort .yes, i've driven the is350. my cousins own a lexus dealership and they will sell me one (or any lexus model) for their cost, so i had hoped to like it. the is350 is a decent automatic. but it's an automatic. it's probably better than bmw steptronic, comparable to the mercedes/amg ""manumatic"" and not as good as the porsche tiptronic. and i would never own one of those. i wouldn't even be happy with the bmw  bmw  ""smg"" transmission. it's not an ""objective""   performance   thing for me, it's a subjective feel, control and driving enjoyment. if you are enough of a ""driver"" to have tested the limits of the vdim and don't like that interference, i am surprised you don't agree, but that's your perogative. i am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the is wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the bmw handles/feels/   safety    better and declare them a winner.i think your curiosity stems from thinking that 2 or 3 objective   performance   measures capture the entire essence of driving feel and enjoyment - and even true   performance   - for everybody. gross oversimplification. as a management consultant, i spend 60 hours a week boiling down complex business strategy and financial issues to a few spreadsheets, graphs and   performance   point slides. but at the end of the day, i can immediately tell you what executives ""get it"" and what ones don't, by how much they go behind the numbers rather than  ford  on them. so the last thing i'm going to do is pick my next car by   design  ing in the back of car and driver or road and track at a bunch of stat toyota ics without spending a lot of time in the drivers seat froming my own subjective opinions.

"primetime79","May 2006"," apparen acura y we have a few things in common as i too am a financial/management professional (senior investment analyst). i hones acura y felt exac acura y the same way you did about automatics before i test drove the is 350. this is the first automatic i have ever owned. the reason i don't have any significant issues with the vdim is because it only comes into play when i feel like driving the car to it's limit (2% of the time). and besides as i mentioned you can easily turn it off in 15 seconds by starting the car with the parking    safety    then tapping the    safety    twice then the park    safety    twice then the    safety    twice. this takes no more than 15 seconds.i love my 350 dearly, however my first choice would have been the  bmw  if i was only patient enough to wait for the new  bmw  to come out.

"cdnpinhead","May 2006"," it's not just bmw.i was put off, long-term, five years ago when i stopped in at a lexus store during my lunch break. i didn't come in wearing flip-flops or a t-shirt, but endured indifferent treatment all the same.even if the i250/350 was worthy (which it isn't, for me), i'd think (at least) twice about ever darkening the doorstep of a lexus dealer again.i'm sure most are better.mine, here in phoenix, wasn't. that lexus service thing is something i read about -- i certainly didn't experience it.

"neko608","May 2006"," i don't think it has anything to do with the make, but it's all about the dealership. i went to motorwerks bmw and woodfield lexus (both in chicago area) and they were all great. "
"v_lad","May 2006"," i was searching for a sedan in 30-35k price range recen acura y and got to test drive lexus. the dealer talked me into trying automatic (i was very surprised they don't have manual with this   performance  ). after getting into it i saw nice pad-shifters and was prepared for a good impression. but after a minute a realized that you can't control current gear of your car - you only limit your maximum gear. you don't even know the gear that's curren acura y on! my current automatic subaru  subaru (165hp) is more sportier in that aspect (it always shows the actual gear that's on). i can't say anything about    performance    - i simply hadn't got that far with a test drive. it's a  comfort , but not anywhere near sport regardless of numbers. someone at lexus should be fired for that type of   design  .

"blueguydotcom","May 2006"," just ought of curiousity. have you ever test driven the is 350 before. because the paddle shifters in sport mode on this car is butter  comfort . and molasses slow. try a double downshift at 65 with the tranny in 6th. that move - i'd really go triple most of the time - takes 5 seconds in the is350. it was excrutiating. i wanted   performance  ...the computer didn't want to give it to me.the car has excellent steering feel.if you like numb, then yes, it's excellent. if you want to feel the road through the wheel, the is350 is too isolated. i guess i am just curious how 9/10 reviewers can say the is wins in 95% of objective measures and then say the bmw handles/feels/   safety    better and declare them a winner.because they like to drive. i find the e90's   design   bland. doesn't matter...i don't buy for how it   design  s on the outside. the   design  's okay - but it's not driver centric enough. the place where the e90 shines against the current competition - balance,    performance   , driver-feedback. driving, there's no other sport sedan that feels the same right now. or better. bummer. at 140+ on the autobahn my e90 feels buttoned down and lets me know everything going on. that makes the car worth owning. drive the is350 hard and it becomes really clear it's not a sport sedan. it's a  comfort   chrysler  with a big   performance  .the 07  pontiac 5 may finally be some competition for the 330i. of course the 07  bmw  with 300 hp and 300 ft-lbs of   performance   from 1400-5000rpm will be hard to be in any fashion.

"corvettefan427","May 2006"," what do you all think of the cadillac  cadillac ? "
"laurasdada","May 2006"," having never driven one because of the following, imho:credit to caddy for beginning to define/redefine itself with the  cadillac . however, the overdone, unattractive   design   and cheap   design  ing, disjointed in   design     design   along with the window sticker sent me quickly on my way the first time i encountered the  cadillac . now, i may be missing a great ride, but i truly enjoy a nicely   design  d   design   and an   design   that suits me is a must. while the   design   does not have to be of the ultimate in materials, i do want a logical and attractive layout (as a reference, audi and lexus do   design  s right in my book) as, of course, that is where i spend my time driving. the  cadillac  (which may have been upgraded since last i   design  ed?) i found quite lacking, especially given the asking price. but, i find all cadillac models a bit aggressive in their prices. hence rebates and ""employee pricing...""i chose the acura  acura  as fwd is not a four letter word to me. i grew up with fwd (saab, honda, mitsu, renault!,  volkswagen ...) and appreciate the snow country advantage (new englnader & avid skier). i believe that honda/acura produces the best    performance    fwds out there (and i know some rwd afficionados would consider that statement an oxymoron!) which suits me just fine. i may lose out to rwd at 9 or 10/10ths, but that is really just not an issue to me. in my comparison shopping, the  acura  offered the best combo of   design  ,  comfort , sport, economy,   performance   and value.maybe the next  cadillac  will be a more suitable candidate.

"davids5","May 2006"," i am not sure that most people are on the same page here. most people may have their own definition of what a sport sedan is and what sporty driving is. working for the usaf in europe, active duty and civilian duty i feel that i have a good idea of what sporty driving and what a sports sedan is. have almost 23 years of driving experience in europe and 20 of them in germany.to me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races,probably most of these so called sport  sedan  are not even equipped with the proper tires for high   performance   sporty driving. while most americans come over here for the first time with their so called sport  sedan  and wagens and think 80mph is   performance   when driving well over 100 mph is a daily and normal ocurance over here.you dont see american ford, gm,honda,toyota,etc burning up the track.many ruin there vehicles or even kill themselves trying to keep up and prove something against the real high   performance   and sport vehicles like mb,bmw,audi- volkswagen  (vag)and of course porsche.i feel that most have been brain washed and are easily sold on bells and sirens,dodads and smoke and mirror tricks that really dont do a thing for true   performance   and true longevity of a vehicle. i dont give a damn if one car has a better dvd-cd changer than the other car or has 20 cup holders.our american car industry needs to start building good solid dependable vehicles starting with high   performance  ed   performance  s that dont spend most of its time at the garage or at the gas station because its such a gas hog.off base here in germany a gallon of gas cost $6.86.they build   performance  full   performance  s over here that use very lit acura e gas and last and gives you years of satisfaction......

"redsoxgirl","May 2006"," sorry, but after another test drive late yesterday, i am even more convinced the is350 is not for me. in my opinion, if lexus were serious about ""sport"" they would have a manaul 6-  performance   or at least   performance   shifting smg. blueguydotcom is right, this is a painfully slow downshifting transmission for anyone who really prefers the control of picking their own gear at any time.but even with a manual transmission, i still think the suspension and steering feedback are a couple of rungs down from bmw. i hate to say it - because i don't like the car - but the  pontiac 5 was better in that regard.las acura y, re-read your ""15 second solution"" to overly interfering vdim. porsche has a button. bmw has a button. this is not a solution from a comapnay that has any serious intention of backing up their ""sport"" marketing with the real thing.the lexus is350 is a nice car for someone other than me.

"fedlawman","May 2006"," ""to me sporty driving isn't 0-60 spurts or 1/4 mile drag races""i tend to agree with you for the most part, but i don't think you can generalize ""americans"" as a whole. h toyota orically, europeans have placed a higher value on    performance    than straight-line   performance  , but things have changed today. american  car  today handle as well as they accelerate, and todays european  car  have placed an emphasis on 0-60 and 1/4 mile   performance   - why do you think that is?the roads here are different, as are the laws (because our society is different). as a result, driving is different here. so, while i agree overall that european  car  tend to perform better than american  car , let me play devil's advocate here and consider some current american  car  - although they're not my cup of tea personally, i could go to a dealer tomorrow and purchase a 2006  chevrolet  or cadillac sts for less than $40,000. are they as good as the european ""equivalent?"" not likely, but they are outstanding  car  in their segment and cost 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a ""comparable"" european car. the  chevrolet  may not have the elegance and refinement of a porsche 911, but on a tw toyota y road or racetrack, they're pretty comparable. both are rewarding to drive and own in their own way - a personal choice. the cadillac vs. mercedes is a similar comparison. i've been driving an  mercedes  mercedes for 2 years now (company car) and, while it is a very substantial car and suprememly  toyota able, it's not at all rewarding to drive from a   performance   perspective. it floats over the road with light, overboosted steering, and rolls hard in corners. i haven't driven the cadillac, but i can't imagine it's significan acura y worse than the m-b.so, while i personlly prefer and own european  car  (i have an e30 bmw  bmw  and a volvo v70), i can understand why someone might enjoy the   performance   and personality of american  car  for what they offer the driver - especially on our poorly maintained, poorly   design  ed american roads.

"fedlawman","May 2006"," ""it doesn't bother me to have to swap them twice per year.""i couldn't agree more. i can't fathom buying a bmw and not getting the sp (ok, if they plan on aftermarket bilsteins and eibachs, i might forgive them  ).the   performance   sacrifices of all-season tires are not worth suffering for the convenience of not installing snow tires in the winter. i probably swap my 15"" and 17"" wheels back and forth at least a half-dozen times a year. it requires a jack,   performance   wrench, and about 15 minutes of my time - what's the big deal?

"gordonwd","May 2006"," i moved from a '98  audi  1.8t  audi  to a '04 (non-sport)325i, so feel qualified to make a comparison. the 325i, imo, is superior to the  audi  in most every way that counts to me (except for driving in the snow on stock all-season tires). it's not nearly as much contrast as what blueguy says, but we all know that he tends to be somewhat -- shall we say? -- strong in his opinions. first off, the difference in horse  performance   was very evident. the 325i is no hotrod at a rated 185 (?), but i think the  audi  was only rated at 150, and we all know that bmw's horses tend to be larger than most. the    performance    on the bimmer is definitely crisper, and brought an actual ""wow!"" out of me the first time i took it through some real esses. i had never felt turn-in like that before, since i'd been driving fwd for many years, and detroit rwd sleds before that.other than that, the ride and road manners are very comparable, and both are very  comfort  and  toyota able out on the highways. but the  audi  could definitely run out of steam in some passing situations on the two-laners. the   design   of the  audi  was very nice, and it definitely had better  comfort  control logic, but now i'm so used to the 325's cockpit-  design   dash that i was disappointed in the   design   styling of the e90.as for styling, i really think that the  audi  peaked out with the model that i owned and that the later revisions and new models have gotten steadily worse. that latest grille is scary and reminds me too much of an edsel (if any of you out there remember those days). i also think that the  bmw  styling peaked out with the facelifted e46 (just coincidentally the model that i happen to own), but styling is always a matter of opinion.so i really don't think that drivers of either brand have cause to throw stones at the other, especially when there are so many other brands more worthy of being thrown at.

"shipo","May 2006"," i don't know, maybe it's just me or maybe my detroit roots showing through, however, even though i hated the   design  s of the 300 when i first saw it, it's kind of grown on me. i was out for a run a month or two back and went by a chrysler dealership that had a new 300 srt8 all done up in a black metallic sitting out front, and i have to admit, i was sorely tempted to at least ask for a test drive.regarding mileage, true the srt8 mileage is something like 17 at best on the highway, however, the 300c (with its v honda ble displacement   performance  ) isn't half bad, more like mid twenties on the highway  honda ing to the folks that i work with that have one.in the end, it really isn't my cup-o-tea, but if i needed a large   performance   sedan with lots of goodies, i'd certainly consider a virtually loaded 300c for under $42,000 (with every option except rear seat video and ash trays) as opposed to an  bmw 5, which when comparably equipped weighs in at nearly $55,000.best regards,shipo "
"dhanley","May 2006"," actually, the  bmw 5x gets 17/24 mpg, same as the 300c, but the 300c has a much more potent v8. aside from that, it's not clear that the  bmw 5 has much of an edge on the  chrysler . infiniti's comparator doesn't make a very strong case to buy the m over the 300c awd, especially considering the $8k price difference.

"ivorypearlg","May 2006"," so sorry for the comparo... i should have did some research about the gas mileage. but in comparison the chrysler does not have vehicle   performance  -sensitive   performance   steering, does not have  comfort  trim on the doors,does not have memory settings for the steering wheel or a   performance   adjustable steering wheel, does not have front-seat active head restraints, and does not have a rear-center seat head restraint. all these are standard on the infiniti, and none of those things are standard or optional on the chrysler.options that you can get on the infiniti you can't get on the chrysler include, heated rear  seat , reclining  seat , cruise control d toyota ance   safety  s, a rear heater, rear seat controls for the audio  technology , bose audio  technology  which in my opinion is much better then a boston sound  technology , which are the speakers on my computer.things that are standard on the infiniti that are optional on the chrysler include an electronic sunroof,and side curtain   safety   for front and rear passengers.infiniti  bmw 5x- 3.5 ltr v-6 280 hp / 270 lb-tq chrysler c awd- 5.7 ltr v-8 340 hp / 390 lb-tq chrysler c awd- 41,051.00 includes cd navigation  technology , sirus sat radio,   performance   sunroof, high-in headlights,protection group 2,and hands free communication,rear back-up   safety  s and a few other small options. to see: http://www-5.chrysler.com/vehsuite/dispatch.doinfiniti  bmw 5x- 49,090.00 includes dvd navigation  technology , sirus sat radio,  comfort  controlled front  seat , 8-spkr bose audio  technology  6 disc auto changer, rear view monitor with   safety  , and pre-crash seat belts. see here -http://www.config.infiniti.com/dispatch.jsp?state_token=2%3 audi 9%3ainfiniti%7cm45%- 7c2006%7c1%7c8zhw/a//7d%7caaaaqaejia%7caaaaqaebia%3a19020&lc=true&seq_id=39&.cur- rentstate=config&.newstate=configvehiclesummaryso there is a $8,039 price difference.also infiniti offers a better warranty then chrysler.personally i still stand with my advice about the infiniti  bmw 5x. the   design  s of the  bmw 5x are also much more inviting and sexier.

"dhanley","May 2006"," no sweat. i've made statements i've had to retract lots of times. there are some options on the infiniti that you can't get on the 300c. and, doub acura essly the infiniti   design   will be higher quality. just saying that   performance   and economy and the majority of    technology nology nology s aren't really differentiating factors. and, it is impressive to me that chrysler puts that thumping pushrod v8 in a car (390 lb-ft!) and matches infinti's mpg. heck, a subaru  subaru  gt gets 19/25 with it's 2.5t and manual tranny. i'm not too big on bose, but i'd have to hear the  technology s back to back to judge. the stereo in my (aging) bmw sucks. my old saab se (harmon-kardon) was much better. a good sterio is on my l toyota  of must-haves for the next davemobile. as for my choosing between these two  car  and the 8k price diff, my preferences run to stick shift & smaller & sportier. i've been considering boxster vs z4. maybe if i needed to haul things i might consider a mangum? dave "

"mikeinmd","May 2006"," regarding pricing and value, specifically between lexus is and bmw 3 series, here is an example (from a reviewer) worth noting:  ""the is 350 i drove, with $8,000 worth of  comfort  package, 18-inch wheels, nav, and mark levinson audio, was $44,000. this suggests that lexus is going toe-to-toe with bmw.  but this isn't really the case, because it doesn't take into account the significan acura y higher level of content on the is. even the base is 250 with a price of $30,580 has leather, 10-way   performance    seat , keyless access and ignition, a cd changer, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and metallic paint standard. all of these are optional on the bmw 325i. adding just the leather, keyless  technology , and metallic paint to the bmw boosts its price, already $1,000 higher than that of the lexus, to $3,400 higher than that of the lexus. adjusting for remaining    technology nology nology  differences boosts that gap even further, to $4,400. the gap is even larger, about $5,000, with the uplevel   performance  s.""

"blueguydotcom","May 2006"," like i  toyota d, i ordered an 06 330i with 6   performance   manual, leather, sport package, xenons,   performance    seat /roof,  toyota  access (keyless ignition/entry) and pdc (park d toyota ance control) for less than 36k - msrp of 41k. the exact car and   design   i wanted. now, try going to lexus and ordering an is350 with the sport package and xenons. best of luck on getting that car. when i visit the lexus site it won't even show me a sport package equipped car. i called dealerships and they all offered to order the car for me - with a deposit and zero info on its delivery time. better luck still getting that car in the exact   design   you want and for less than msrp. you're   design  ing at over 39.7k - assuming a dealer will try to ""order"" (can't really order a lexus) an is350 for you that way. of course he's gonna demand a deposit, it may take from 4-8 months to get the car and service isn't free (add at least another $1500 for service -    safety   , oil changes, tune ups- over 45k miles).so, no the lexus is350 isn't in the same ballpark as a 330i as i wanted one. it wasn't even close. my 330i cost considerably less than the is350 with sport/xenons, which if it ever arrived would have been crippled by an automatic transmission.

"habitat1","May 2006"," with all due respect to those that might shop both the is350 and 330i and make the decision based upon price, i think you're in the minority.neither of these  car  are inexpensive and the purchase decision is likely to be based upon personal preference, not a couple thousand dollars. with respect to the is and 330, at least to me, they are very different in their driving character. i really don't think these  car  are seriously cross shopped as much as this forum might suggest. casually cross shopped, maybe. but if you prefer bmw    performance   , steering and driving  toyota mics, it's unlikely that 300 hp stuffed into an automatic sedan with a lexus suspension is going to get you to switch your preference. and if you prefer lexus   design     design  s and ample electronic do dads, along with exceptional relability, you're probably not going to switch your preference to a more spartan drivers car.so, my guess is that the price/value debate is more of a friendly joust than a real factor for 90% of buyers. lexus could sell the is350 for $20k and i won't buy an automatic sport sedan. not picking on lexus - i wouldn't even buy the $85k  bmw  smg for a similar discount.

"maximafan","July 2006"," the  acura  is definitely a vehicle that gives you a lot of ""bang for the buck."" now, if only acura would offer some better lease support on the  acura . i know here in my hometown in florida, i just want to laugh out loud when i'm perusing the saturday ads in the auto section for the various leases, i.e., acura, infiniti.  for instance, the local ad in town for the acura  acura  for a lease on a non-navi right now is $354 a month, but they want $4,000 down. $354 a month might sound nice, but after reading these forums over the past year,  there's no way i'm putting $4,000 down to lease a vehicle. the infiniti ads are the same way. they want ridiculous amounts for a down payment on a lease. i get so p.o.'d when i see this every weekend. i have to admit, i have hardly seen any really decent lease offers that anyone has been getting even on these forums, and i check the other forums besides acura. i'm always checking out the lexus forums, the infiniti forums (granted some people, particularly in california, seem to get some outstanding deals.) it always seems like slim-pickings when it comes to leasing these days. just my rantings!

"jzalkin","August 2006"," ""the reality for many of us is that we want a 4-door rwd car with a manual transmission, good    performance   , good   performance   and a back seat that isn't a joke for adults to ride in (the back seat in the is is such a joke that my kids couldn't even fit)."" i agree that the is is not for you, but i would argue that lexus and many other manufactures are willing to give up those sales. lexus can do it - they choose not to. it makes their  car  better for some and worst for others. clearly the is is not for people who carry 4 people often. it is for people that prefer coupes, but want/need the benefit of a sedan. i rarely have anyone in the back seat (one every few months), but it is nice to have it as extra storage. the rear doors help with utilizing the  comfort  for many reasons. think of it as a roomier execution of the  mazda  concept. if one needs a full family car - then lexus offers the es and gs. i have had multiple people in my back seat as everyone wants a ride in the new car so the backseat is just fine for lunch trips, etc. i think people make too big a deal about the size unless they need a full size sedan. a lot of single or married (no/small kids) professionals that do not need a roomey back seat. why would lexus make the 350 have a manual? retool and add the extra cost for maybe 5% more sales. does that make economic sense? time will tell if lexus has judged the market correc acura y. if they have solid (does not have to be industry best) sales then they have targeted correc acura y. early results are positive. keep in mind, car makers are in business to sell  car  - not satisfy a minority of posters. that is why the is250 automatic will be the best seller in the lineup. i believe as stated in a previous post (reinforced by edmunds article) that manuals are a dying breed. i had several through the years and have no desire to use a clutch ever again.the great thing is that there are a lot of good choices. if manual and a large   performance   is your thing then you can have a great car. lexus will not mourn loosing you. i also believe (don't have the stat toyota ics) that automatics have a better resale since they are more desirable. same as having leather.enjoy whatever car you choose.

"jzalkin","August 2006"," here it is. i will call you out as an idiot and you will be ridiculed by all if you argue against the basic points.point 1: all of these  car  (3 series, is,  pontiac 5, c class,  cadillac ,  acura ) belong in this group. some are newer and some are getting long in the tooth, but they all are competition. if a lot off people cross shop a model then it is competition. if only a few then it is not. i bet almost everyone   design  ed at a few of these model before selecting their car.point 2: different is good. it leads to choices and ability to get the best fit for them. some difference help and some hurt. sales will determine if a model is a success. point 3: just because you want a    technology nology nology  - does not make it the end all be all definition. just because you think a car should have a manual does not mean everyone else does. just because the  acura  is not rwd, does not mean it does not belong. get over yourself - you are not the resident expert. you are just like the rest of us posting nothing more than your opinion. if you will only drive a manual then i guess that matters to you. since the vast majority of people (bmw buyers included) do not drive a manual - that is not a criteria for selection. i could not see anyone saying ""i want an automatic, but i won't   design   at the is since the 350 does not offer a manual."" does anyone else see the   safety  urdity of this argument?point 4: berating others is childish just makes you   design   like and idiot. enough  toyota d.point 5: no one car is the overall best. one may be best given certain criteria, but another criteria will put another car on top. -----------i picked the is for me. came down to the bmw and i just didn't like it as much. i had the  audi  and just didn't love the bmw with i-drive (nav) in it.

"blueguydotcom","September 2006"," in the realm of   performance  s that get 20-30 or 24-32, i'd expect to compare the low ends the same way.07  pontiac 5 - (15k miles /19 mpg) x 3.30 = 260506 is250 - (15 k miles / 24 mpg) x 3.30 = 206206 330i - (15 k miles / 20 mpg) x 3.30 = 2475so yeah the is250 gets great gas mileage but it's a really lousy car, imho. it's easily worth $400-600 to me per year to not drive an is250.

"jzalkin","September 2006"," i did not say that you cared about the difference, but many people do. the difference in real world driving will most often be bigger. i would expect a real world mpg difference of 6-7mpg. since lexus sells more is250s than 350s (audi sells more 2.0t vs 6cyl, etc) it leads me to the conclusion that most people do not care about overall   performance  . ps - how is the is a ""really lousy car""?   performance   on par with the smaller   performance  s of other brands audi, mb, bmw, etc. you may not like the car, but calling it lousy looses you credibility. i chose the lexus over the bmw, but i can see how people like the bmw. there is really no lousy car in this segment; just choices with different attributes. for example, what car matches the ""lousy""   design   of the lexus?

"kernick","September 2006"," well my definition of a manual is a transmission with a clutch-pedal. anything else regardless of whether it has a clutch a ru toyota er-belt (cvt), dsg, a   performance   converter or whatever is an automatic. they are just different v honda tions of automatic operation. imo, an automatic transmission is one that you don't have to intervene with, unless you want to. in general: if a person can do anything better than a machine, it is simply a matter of time until that machine is evolved (  design  ed) to be better. a person may enjoy shifting a manual and controlling the car in general, but more and more functions of a car can be better handled by the machine.on the  car  being discussed here, i think either transmission is acceptable. i wouldn't worry about 0.2 sec difference or whatever in ""optimum launch""   performance  , when this class of vehicle is not optimized for   performance   anyway. the  car  being discussed here are too big, too heavy, and too small of displacement (at least without forced induction) to really qui toyota le about their   performance  .i'd take the '07  pontiac 5x as the pick of the class for having adequate   performance   combined with all-weather awd, at a decent price.

"robertr","September 2006"," agree with your definition of what an automatic is. i dislike automatics (=anything without a clutch) for a number of reasons. one in particular is i like to control how and when my car shifts. i hate it when you want to accelerate suddenly with an automatic - you floor the gas - then there is a delay - then it downshifts with a big jerk - then it finally goes with more   performance   than you want but too late when you could have finessed it with an anticipatory double-clutched  comfort  downshift to the proper gear with  comfort  throt acura e application in a manual. a skillfully driven stick is still much  comfort er and more controlled than an automatic in all driving conditions despite automatics having gotten much better in recent years. the 2007  pontiac 5 automatic rev-matching    technology nology nology  on downshifts is the latest interesting improvement - i wonder if it will eliminate the jerk on the downshift that i experience everytime i get a loaner when my car is in for service. nevertheless it will be a long long time before i want to give up the fun and satisfaction of driving a true manual.

"louiswei","September 2006"," the bottom line is: lexus is not out there to satisfy the so-called enthusiast. they are simply out there selling  car  no matter how you going to spin it. the sales number for the is is around 5000-6000 units per month and compare to  bmw 's 10k+ i think so far the is is doing a pretty good job sales-wise. the rome is not built in one day, so does not the  bmw  nor the is. it took bmw many decades to establish the  bmw  as the benchmark and it's likely that it'll take some time for others to knock it off (if they ever will).one thing that frustrated me the most is that many lexus owners can understand why others went for the  bmw  (pure driving  toyota mics) and why we went for the is (balance between luxurious and   performance  ). however, on the other end, the so-call pure enthusiasts (you know whom i am talking about) can never acknowledge that the is is a capable competitor in this segment. i am going to say this one last time: driving  toyota mics may be the ultimate factor for you but that may not be the one for many other people, you know? lighten up,   design   outside your own box then maybe you'll have a better perspective.y'all have a good day  "

"jzalkin","September 2006"," lexus has stated the goal of the new is is being exceeded so i would call it a success. how many version of the 3 series is there ( sedan , m, coupe, convertible). the is has only one version (sedan). it is selling 5k-6k a month - not bad for one v honda tion. lexus has even learned to stagger versions to keep interest up. how many bmw (current or potential) owners will visit lexus when the is500 comes? would it be better for some if it had a manual for the 350 - yes. electronics can be turned off now - so it is a non issue. would the bmw be better without i-drive and enhanced   design     design  . what about better reliability - sure.here is a question - how many bmw 3 series did they sell in its 2nd generation in the us? not sure of answer myself, but it is amazing what lexus (and infiniti) is achieving in a short time f dodge e. here is a statement i think holds true. the lexus satisfies  comfort  owners and is also bringing in enthusiasts as well. considering gen 1 was not a sales success - there are a lack of repeat buyers. most are from other car makers (like audi for me). imagine what will happen in gen 3. considering it came down to the bmw & lexus for me, i would say both have good produ cadillac  and that lexus achieved its goal. i have never owned a lexus (audi, ford cobra, 300zx, rx-7) and lexus struck the right balance of  comfort , driving fun, and overall ownership experience with the is. ps - go read club lexus if you don't believe that enthusiasts are also buying it.

"habitat1","September 2006"," i have no doubt that the vast majority of is owners are enthusiastic about their car. as they should be.but it appears to me that lexus, with the is and gs, directed a lot of their marketing towards the ""driving"" enthusiast. they even advertised the new gs with a new ""6-  performance   transmission"" (no reference to automatic) and showed a glimpse of somebody appearing to shift gears in bmw   design   winding bav honda n road commercial. stupid me stopped by a dealership between meetings and learned that it was nothing more than a slushbox with a manual shift capability. i still drove it. dissapointing is an understatement. i have   safety  olutely no problem giving lexus credit where it is due. the make a superbly crafted automobile, with great reliability. mercedes got a  suzuki  kick in the [non-permissible content removed] and we have all benefited by the increased competition. to that, i say ""thanks lexus"", and i mean it.where i part company with some lexus enthusiasts, is my belief the is and gs could be significan acura y better at delivering on their marketing theme of going after the driving enthusiast. like honda did with the $32k s2000 that gave the $60k porsche boxster s a run for their money. it seems that some would like to forgive lexus their sporting deficiencies and substitute   technology nology no-goodies and   design     design   for driving  toyota mics in the comparison with the  bmw .   design  , i understand trade offs. i bought a  acura  6-  performance   because of the balance of attributes - at a great price. but you won't find me touting that it's comparable to the  bmw  in driving  toyota mics. and, the  acura  comes with a 6-  performance  , brembo    safety   , and a sport suspension that, in spite of fwd, apparan acura y beats the is350 in a the slalom.so i'm not here to bash the is350 for what it is. but i will continue to call a spade a spade about what it isn't. and i hope lexus doesn't try to use a 1,000 watt 32 speaker mark levinson stereo to bribe more driving enthusiast's into succumbing to  comfort  as a substitue for what a serious sports sedan should be.

"killerbunny","September 2006"," regarding the msrp of a is350 and bmw bmw  are equal right here in canada. that is why i bought the bmw bmw . i waited years and years and years for such a relative bargain like the bmw bmw . interesting. i live in canada too.msrp for is350 is $49,000. including auto transmission and heated vented leather  seat .msrp for 335 is $51,600. with only mannual and fake leather.auto costs $1700 and leather belong to a $4,200 package. i suppose they aren't giving a huge discount, since 335 is a new model. (correct me if otherwise)btw, the bmw site l toyota ed 335's 0-100km   performance   to be 5.6s for manual and 5.8s for auto. you can argue it handles better than is350. but the   performance   won't obliterates is350. you still got to use  bmw  for that purpose.

"dandrews1","October 2006"," well, an xke is a great car, but this thread was about entry level - the bmw 5 series is a bit above what could arguably be called entry level (it starts @ 58,600$ ca toyota n up here, with the 525i @ 215 hp, and pretty bare on the accessories.)equip the 5 series with a decent   performance  , some good packages, and you're starting to   design   at it in the ca$80k + range (for the 530xi model)compare that to a jaguar x-type 3.0 sport, which comes pretty much loaded @ ~ca$53k.if you're   design  ing at the s-type, i am kind of iffy on the   design   queues on that one... but can't argue with what it is - a marketing device meant to fill the void between the x-type and the xj / xk level. (apologies to any s-type lovers out there, but that's just my personal opinion.. i don't see the point in getting the s-type with the x-type available.. from my perspective, either fork out for the xj, or keep your pennies with the x-type).i'll eat my words for one exception to the s-type family - the s-type r. it's a monster. 400 hp, and  comfort  as silk. i had the pleasure of getting to take a test drive in one of these... pretty much no words to describe how much i love driving this car. but, i would rather have the xjr for about ca$15k more, or the xkr, whenever that becomes available up here.in the end, it may all wind up being a matter of personal choice. i see bmw's everywhere (i live in the same town as bmw's ca toyota n headquarters) and nobody   design  s twice because they are so common now. imho, all their  car    design   alike (the 3, 5 and to some degree, 7 all   design   like sligh acura y longer, or shorter versions of the same car) and i'm getting really sick on them... but a jaguar turns heads everywhere it goes - resale value notwithstanding./da "

"rockylee","October 2006"," rocky, i'm not going to give you a lesson on economics and try to convince you to buy a bmw.thank-you. i guess habitat, i'm partial pal with gm, because most of my family has worked for them and delphi.dad, and a few remaining relatives took the early buy-out at the end of july after 27 yrs. i still have a few family members left on the gm and delphi payroll. i'm not on bmw's marketing payroll and i don't care what you drive. vice- nissan  i'm sure.that is correct again. i'm just glad you aren't interested in  car  made with cheap labor by child slaves. at least bmw's for the most part are made by people that are paid a livable wage and most are union-made and i can respect that pal. but i will share my personal experience and why i don't ever see financially soph toyota icated buyers flocking from bmw (or lexus, or acura or..) to cadillac.for the most part you are correct. cadillac has rebounded itself. i agree they need get that   design   down to european levels to have a chance at regaining market-share.from 1987 to 1995 i owned a acura  acura . initial cost $12,600. retired to salvation army in 1995 w/ 127k miles.  those were fun to drive  car . like a go-kart, my buddy had a gs-r coupe a mid 90's model  ifrom 1995 to present i own a nissan  nissan . initial cost $20,500. retired from primary duty in 2004, but still alive and kicking at 155k miles. nissan 's are nice. they were a big player in the mid-90's. they have redone the   design   very nicely, what last year ? perhaps there is a gm/cadillac model that you would find attractive to own for the next 10 years.i used to swap  car  often, but now i like to hold on to them for at least 3 years. i'm going to buy at least my wifes grandma's 2000 buick  toyota  for $4k. she passed away a couple of months ago. it has like 70k on it. it will be my future work car. my grandmother has a 2002 oldsmobile aurora, with 43k and she is willing to sell it to me for $10k. i think i'm going to buy it also for the wife and kids. that's below trade in value. i'm going to pay cash for both. i have a seriously difficult time renting a gm for 10 days on business.getting the low-end models must stink.for me, the value of a  bmw , or any number of other really well built and well   performance  ered  car , is that they can last 10-15 years - and still be enjoyable to drive at the end of that time.i completely understand. gm, in the past they built some very horrible  car . i know why you are so skeptical about the future. in my eyes i'm finally seeing action, instead of just promises from gm. i as you know post alot. i spend alot of time gathering the newest inside secrets i can, and like posting links on edmunds. especially when it has something to do with gm.if you buy high quality that lasts, at a fair price, you will almost always be ahead of buying low quality at a cheaper price. agree gm has a long h toyota ory of producing vehicles that, after 5 years, hardly anyone wants to own. they might have the ability to last 150k miles, but if they weren't already killing you with squeaks and rat acura es when they were new, they certainly will by the 5 year mark.agree. however i'm beginning to see changes. the 2004'  pontiac  was the beginning of change and signs of quality. it didn't sell well because of   design  . the lucerne is another nice piece of quality. now we have the new suv's cuv's trucks, and you gotta agree that was a huge quality jump from the previous generation. habitat, take a saturn  saturn  sometime when you get a chance for a test drive. it's not like you are obligated to buy it. how bout those kappa twins ? i seriously doubt even you would find a 5+ year ownership experience desirable.off the top of my head the aurora's, 95-99 riviera were both rock solid. my former 02' cadillac seville sts was rock solid also. but yeah, for the most part you are correct unfortunately.i'm sure gm would have something with another 100 lbs of   performance   to get your blood going. and you'd be stuck trying to find someone who finds a 4-5 year old caddy an attractive car. they may be out there where you live, but they sure aren't in my neighborhood.yes cadillacs, are very popular around here. lots of conservative people around here. they like domestics especially the trucks and suv's (mainly gm) michigan, otoh the conservatives like japananese, and domestics, kinda weird to me. :surprise:so in summary, i don't fault you for liking gm. that's your prerogative. and, i certainly don't fault you for thinking $40k is expensive. i made the same as you when i bought that  acura  and thought, at the time, that a $20k  honda  was too much.$40k i think is alot of money, no matter how much you make. if i was a millionaire it would still be a good chunk of change. i hope gm, can make a car that even somebody like you would like to own someday. but i would respectfully suggest that true build quality and long term value are not things that should be dismissed in favor of leather and   performance  . and that's where imo, bmw will continue to shine over gm. they do shine, and have a huge fan base. people who can and can't afford but both desire them the same. i've always respected bmw's  car . it's not like they are pos's. they are true-blue german   performance  ered. even i was close to pulling the trigger on a very low mileage 97' black  bmw  sedan last year.  got a question, i sat in my buddy's 97'  bmw  sedan in the back seat. is the  bmw  as  comfort  as it in the back seat ???? how much will the 400 hp  bmw  be ? will the sedan be the same price as the coupe ???? (if you know by chance?)p.s. in 1988 i bought a fixer upper house in a good neighborhood that i stretched for. this month, i'll send in the final mortgage payment. it's current market value is about as much as our 911s ... plus a 911 turbo, cayenne turbo, and carrera gt combined. hey rich guy, if you ever come to texas, you need to   design   me up and give me a ride in your 911s :p ne ways congrats on paying your home off. i bet that felt good.  too bad my generation will never be able to get a ""affordable"" home. they are so out of line with prices. :mad: dad, and grandpa told me it use to be that the rule of thumb was to not buy more house than 1-weeks net pay. now they say 2 weeks and if your spouse has a job 3 weeks. :surprise: i know i'm much younger than you, but is my generation insane or what habitat ????so don't feel too bad for your friends that put money into a house instead of a caddy... or a bmw... or even an acura  honda . that is true, but some of them are buying the cadillac of houses.... one's they really can't afford. i think if you   design  ed around you'd agree. house + car doesn't=job :confuse:rocky "

"captain2","October 2006"," entry level  comfort    performance   sedan? don't know that you can classify 'entry' without also talking price - is 50k+ for a 530, e350, or a gs meet all defintions of what most folks consider a ' comfort  sports sedan' sure -- entry level not for most folks. is even the small 330 pushing the price envelope. probably. so really what you are left with are a few suitably   performance  ed fwd  car  and a notable exception, the  pontiac 5. and then, the dilemma, how can any car with 60% or more of its weight over its drive wheels be a true   performance   car. acura has tried hard with the  acura , ending up with ride sacrifices while still not eliminating the understeer endemic to the weight imbalance and the   performance   steer common to many well   performance  ed fwd  sedan . ditto for things like  nissan s,  chevrolet  ss/gp.for my part, ending up with an  toyota  touring after shopping both the  acura  and  pontiac 5, the  toyota  and  acura  both at about 30k the  pontiac 5 a few thousand more. the  pontiac 5 definitely the only one that i would define as a   performance   car, it is a hoot to drive but at the price of the fit/  design   and  comfort  levels found in the  acura / toyota . the  acura , a muuch rougher ride - the  toyota  the surprise i didn't anticipate - a car that will run with either of the other two (until the road gets really curvy), much larger and more  toyota able, trading off some of that '   performance   ' for a far better ride. the touring model definitely the trim line of choice, more tigh acura y sprung and perhaps a lit acura e more 'fun'. not sure though that 6 second 0-60 or 100 mph quarters necessarily makes it a '  performance  ' sedan though - don't think that is possible in a fwd car.

"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," still don&#146;t get why you use 44k as price if you buy and 39.9 if you lease.if buy you pay taxes. if you lease you pay taxes on the portion you use. so, when i compare the two options, taxes play a huge role. buy the car, you're down 44k, lease the car and you pay only taxes on the portion you use.taxes aside and lets say the selling price after 3 years is 24, would make the difference of 15.9 (39.9-24).no. you have to pay the taxes. no way around it. not sure what planet you're on but if you buy a 40k car, you're paying those taxes up-front. p.s. i too prefer to lease but found it more expensive then buying for cash and then trading the car in for a new one.no way. if you negotiate a crappy lease, sure. but given bmw's propped up leasing model, i come out ahead easily on leasing. bmw overvalues their  car  residuals and usually gives you a decent mf. bimmers lose about 20% of their value in year 1 - taxes included because you can't avoid paying them on a purchase.secondly, trading in a car you lose even more. that's giving thousands away. trading-in a car you're talking about another 2-3k difference in price from private-party resale. trade-in value of my 03 330i was hovering in the low 20s. i woulda taken a bath: as will any person who trades-in a late-model car to a dealership.

"pg48477","October 2006"," well, i guess we are on two different planets. if you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference, therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in. second, the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in, for bmw that is. and please don&#146;t quote me k toyota  or edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes. i spend my share on dealers auctions and i can assure you bmw in a good condition will bring good money. i can see you are very passionate about leasing and ed, there is no need to get upset if you perfect deal is not so perfect. just go back to planet earthjagain, if you lease you always pay more, at lease the money factor if you are good negotiator. "
"captain2","October 2006"," you point out a few of the reasons why leasing a car is very rarely if ever reflective of the actual price paid. other factors that allow for an 'apparen acura y' good price include finance charge buydowns, something relatively new called 'market equalization' fees, adjsutable mileage allowances and fees, residual adjustments relative to the anticipated 'damages' done to the car at lease end. there is a reason why dealers prefer leasing - it is easier for them to get approved and much more profitable for them. not to mention all those low mileage 'prog dodge '  car  they get back to make even more of a killing on!could never understand the logic of leasing unless, of course, you really don't drive much or really want a new car every 3 years or so. many of my friends have  car  on leases and will usually brag about that fictious lease 'sales' price, and then find halfway thru the lease or so that they can't use the car nearly as much as they want to, and ultimately are hit with mileage and/or damage chargebacks at lease end that forces the refinance of the residual on an actual purchase for several thousand more than what the car is really worth. or is all rolled into another lease - a self-perpetuating problem, that sooner or later, has to be bought out of.in any event, although a good lease can minimize your monthly out-of-pocket, it will never be cheaper than an actual purchase, and a cash price remains really the only way to determine a car's actual sell price. and you are right, the only thing that dealers like better than late model trades is the service depts. - this is where they really make their money. "
"pg48477","October 2006"," just one more point, in case of the lease bank owns the car not the dealer. in most cases the bank will sell the car on the dealers auction, the price they get will eventually make up residual % you get at the purchase. so, in real life residual value equals the price on the dealers auction (or in other words &#147;trade in&#148;). in case of bmw bank, they usually charge low money factor, therefore their residuals are very accurate, otherwise they&#146;ll lose money, and trust me bank will never loose their money.not replying direc acura y to you captain2, just continuing the trail. "
"jtla","October 2006"," also not replying to you, p pontiac 8477, just continuing this thread.the true financial advantage on leasing comes from, as blueguydotcom pointed out, the saving on sales tax. unfortunately, even this saving is often largely offset by the so-called acquisition fee ($600-$900) up front and termination fee ($350 to $600) at lease end. in some states, sales tax is levied on the selling price of the vehicle.leasing can be a better deal than purchasing only when there is factory subsidy that is not available/applicable to purchase (for example, artificially high residual). otherwise, lease is almost always more expensive than purchase. the reason is plain and simple: no dealer or bank would share with you the cost of ownership of a vehicle. "
"mikefm58","October 2006"," one more note here on this, where leasing is a definite advantage is if the vehicle is used as part of a business, such as a realtor or other sales person. there are d toyota inct tax advantages of leasing versus an outright purchase for commercial vehicles.but for individuals, leasing is ""virtually 100%"" more expensive in the long run over a purchase. "
"circlew","October 2006"," i agree that lease is cheaper than the depreciation hit in re-sale value. my lease is 12,000 miles/3yrs. and will probably go for $800 for extra miles 4 months before lease end. the extra cost for lease vs. buy is because you need to lease twice vs. buying and keeping 6 years.if you buy and keep the car over 6 years, you probably are flirting with 100k so depreciation levels out in the later years but basically the maintenance/repair costs increase   performance  . the resale is low and hit is high vs. original cost.the savings in buying comes after year 6 but the car is basically getting tired in at least some major drive train parts. but if the car stays sound, you start saving in repair costs.

"blueguydotcom","October 2006"," well, i guess we are on two different planets. if you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference, therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in.that's dependent on state. in ca your trade-in does not count for squat on taxes. trade in a 40k car for a 40k car and you're still down 4k on taxes. second, the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in, for bmw that is.i've owned a couple  bmw  now. there's a pervasive myth they don't lose much value. and please don&#146;t quote me k toyota  or edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes. i spend my share on dealers auctions and i can assure you bmw in a good condition will bring good money. not from what i see.  bmw  lose insane amounts of value quickly. after year 3, like everything else, the slide slows.again, if you lease you always pay more, at lease the money factor if you are good negotiator.ba toyota le that's just ignorant. i've proven you wrong already... you're talking but not making any sense. you're using terms like ""always"" and yet you don't seem to understand them. my last lease, i saved thousands leasing.  chevrolet ly because the car took a huge hit on depreciation and the tax savings.

"louiswei","October 2006"," oh, blueguy, i am pretty sure the  bmw  are flying out of the dealer lot with price below msrp. like i  toyota d, usually the edmunds' tmvs are off for some reason. i wouldn't be surprised to find out that the  bmw  are selling for about $1000 under msrp. i know for people like you that's not that great of a deal but compare to many suckers whom are paying msrp that's not that bad at all - especially for a hot car like  bmw .i agree with you on that if people truly want to land a great deal they should shop around the coutry. when i bought my is350 back in april i found out that i can get probably another $1000 to $1500 off the deal i got in a acura anta if i buy it from dealers in cali. however, with the school and many interviews lining up back them, a trip to cali to pick up the car just seems not logical to me. also, since i was planning to finance my car for at least 4 years, $1000 difference (about 20 dollars per month) is just not that significant after all. the bottom line is: would i want to get a better deal than the one i got ($1500 off msrp)? yes. but after taking everything into consideration, it seems more reasonable for me to buy it from my local dealership.

"habitat1","October 2006"," two comments:(1) i agree that you need to draw the value line somewhere when it comes to saving money. my business partner, with a net worth in the solid 8 figure range, considered importing a honda  honda  from canada a few years ago to save an extra $1,000 on the exchange rate. needless to say, he's a great lawyer and investor in our company, but i handle the financial decisions. that example aside, i have found it unnecessary to go accross country or outside the country to do a lit acura e arbitrage bargaining.(2) leasing vs. buying: blueguydotcom may be an exception, but i always seem to have the strongest negotiating position when i can write a check for an in-stock car and dare the dealer to rip it up. edmunds tmv on my 2002 s2000 was $36,000 (yes, $3,200 over msrp). the saturday before thanksgiving in 2001, i walked out with one for $32k even. the discount on my 2005 911s cab was even more substantial. at one year and 10,000 miles, i could sell it for, at worst, $8-9,000 less than i paid for it (about 50% of what the annual lease payments would be). i am in a lucky state that recognizes trade in values on taxes. i am of the general opinion that when you introduce another party to a transaction - i.e. a leasing company or financial institution - they need to make money to stay in business. if, in fact, they have a cost of capital that is significan acura y below mine, they might be able to do that and still offer me some value in return. but, for a lot of people, that internal cost of capital could be a 6%-7% home equity loan, with the interest being tax deductible. that's hard to beat.

"jzalkin","October 2006"," i went to the miami auto show last night and here are some of my thoughts:infiniti:if you liked the previous  pontiac 5, you will like the new one. if you did not - then the new car will probably not change your mind. the   design     design  s better (as do most newer nissan's), but still seem a lit acura e off in terms of feel and flow. it is so hard to tell a  pontiac 5 from a  bmw 5/45 in a glance - it takes a stare (will it help raise value of the g or cheapen the m? - time will tell)bmw:the new coupe is nice, but not that striking when it is surrounded by all other models. bmw   design  s still seem to be a weak link of the car.lexus:the new ls   design  s as a classier version of the 7 series.   design  s are nice, but each model seems to have the same feel from is to ls. just gets larger. it is easy to see how the new ls will retain loyal toyota s and add a few sales based on the reaction the car was getting.mercedes:even the carpeting on their section was more plush than the others. high status,   design   without the bmw controversy and the sticker price to match. jaguar:the new xk-r is great. retains the beauty of the base model and makes it d toyota inctive enough to show it is special. if the   design  er of this model works on the others - they may have something.audi: volkswagen  and audi are so much a like. audi is loosing a lit acura e of its d toyota inctiveness. no s8 there which was a let down. audi lacked flair since the new model that they had was just a revised  audi  cab to have the new nose and   performance  . anyone else dislike the new steering wheel also? it reminds me of a bumper car with the small round pad that sticks out. (i had an '04  audi  cab and loved that 3 spoke)acura:the new  acura  will be a hit - very nice. the s type  acura  did not get the attention that i thought it would. the  acura  is an odd car - above a standard family car, but not quite the level of the bmw, mercedes, infiniti, etc. the  acura  was the only car that people were really checking out.hyundai:not relevant to this discussion, but they had the best models (humans) by far.   design  ed at the  hyundai  fe because one asked us if we wanted to hear about it. actually a nice suv - a brand on the upswing.lincoln:whoa, what are they thinking? the  lincoln  is horrible compared to the cadillac,  chevrolet , and gmc. mercury :they know how to dress up a ford. the   mercury   is very nice for the money.

"habitat1","October 2006"," ""i do not understand why auto-makers are doing this. any thoughts ???"" one reason is the unidirectional tires and staggered f/r tire sizes. take a 550i sport for example. the front tires can't be interchanged with the rear, and the left and right sides are not interchangible since the tire tread is specifically   design  ed to rotate in one direction. so, if you wanted to adequately cover all potential flats, you'd need to carry 4 full size spares. another reason is the increased size of wheels and tires. when that 550i starts wearing 18/19"" wheels with 275 width rear tires, that makes the old spare wheel well in the trunk obsolete.what is unfortunate is that several  car  really don't have the credentials to wear high   performance   low profile unidirectional tires on oversized rims, but do so simply to   design   more impressive. i haven't driven the new lexus gs, but unless it's a d dodge atic departure form the previous model, this is not a   performance   sedan and does not have a suspension or chassis that requires high   performance   tires to tap the last bit of    performance    prowess. frankly, it's a waste of good ru toyota er.

"louiswei","October 2006"," to answer some of your questions...is250/350 shares the platform with the gs350/430/450h. since it's a rwd platform i do not believe it is shared with any other toyota produ cadillac  except maybe some rwd models which are only available in japan.i do not have information on which other nissan/infiniti product shares the platform with  pontiac 5 (the m maybe?). however, i think the  pontiac 5 coupe shares the platform with the 350z (somebody please correct me if i am wrong). one thing that i am certain is that  pontiac 5 does not share platform with  nissan  because one is rwd ( pontiac 5) and another is fwd ( nissan ).

"dougiex","November 2006"," good points. the comparison however is between turbocharged and naturally aspirated   performance  s. you forgot to mention that the beamer has very good   performance  /hp ratio though. "
"dougiex","November 2006"," true the bmw has a classic   design   over time. however i think my  pontiac 5 coupe still   design  s phat after 3 years. but who know what it will   design   like after 5 years if its gene pool is any indication i think it will still   design   good just like the 300z and the skyline gt.before you use the word ""cheap"" too loosely note that the latest jd   performance   and associates rank the infiniti and bmw line about the same in terms of initial quality and neither of them is even close to a lexus. but then again maybe what you call cheap is just what i call good bang for my bucks. "
"dougiex","November 2006"," so we don't all have the same taste for good    performance    and what good   performance   and   performance   should feel like. that doesn't mean the bmw isn't overrated.well, reliability is one thing but   performance  /   performance    is another thing. the [non-permissible content removed] under-performed in the    performance    department. haven't heard any high   performance   driving school using japanese  car . they use some americans but mos acura y german sports sedan/ car  -  bmw / bmw / bmw , audi s/rs, porsche 911/cayman/boxster, etc.your last argument is faulty though. not because driving schools use european  car  mean that they are the best at    performance    ???? that is what european car makers do. they promote and sponsor driving schools so people can ""enjoy"" their  car  more. its like someone who likes pontiacs and  chevrolet s saying you don't see many european  car  at daytona or at nascar events. thats just what american auto makers do . if you go to most underground racing events around the world you wont see many european  car  either but that does not mean they are not good  car  or have good    performance   . or because european  car  do not appear in ""  performance   and furious"" movies and games they must not have good    performance   . if there are any   performance   driving schools in the east (japan, australia, etc) they are likely to have japanese  car . in addition the  car  you use as examples are in a different class as i would not compare a  pontiac 5 coupe with an  bmw / bmw  or porsche. in fact i think you would be dissing a porsche to make such a comparison to a bmw 3xx series or  pontiac 5 coupe they just don't compare.

(in fairness, cadillac   design  ers do need to be shot for the center stack of the outgoing  cadillac !)the car had good   performance   but it was still in break-in so had some hesitation on   performance   that will disappear with time. the analog clock in the middle is gorgeous and classy, imho. the manumatic worked well but was a lit acura e slow to downshift. the tachometer also seemed to be placed weirdly on the instrument panel, but that's a personal thing. it did not have german ""road feel"" but the steering was tight (hint to lexus   performance  ers, add that!), and it handled grea acura y. the stereo was definitely not class leading. it worked. we could just leave it there. the   technology nology  worked.  i didn't bring my mp3 player. moreover, i didn't test drive a  technology  with nav to upload mp3's to the flash card. it was nice but definitely a bit more sport than  comfort . it felt like a cheaper, more reliable bmw.all of the above was just mho.host, might we add the saab 9-3 to this forum instead of that $60k 15-speaker, full-size cadillac sts?

"stl540","November 2006"," i test drove the 2007  pontiac 5s  infiniti  and  bmw  sp  infiniti  yesterday. here are my opinions.  design   (subjective area that i will not get into): pontiac 5s - i like the updated   design  s of the  pontiac 5 compared to the previous gen bmw  &#150; i also like the   design  s of the  bmw . winner &#150; draw (too subjective)  design  : pontiac 5s - the   design   is also improved over the previous gen. some of the   design   plastic   design  s somewhat cheap, but taking the lower price into consideration, it   design  s fine. the   design   is a nice improvement over the previous gen. the sport  seat  were  toyota able, and the thicker steering wheel felt nice. i would have to get used to hvac and radio controls, but they seem to be in a good position. i did find myself trying to turn up the radio with the temperature dial. again, my un mazda rity was the cause. bmw  &#150; higher quality materials than the g. i do not care for the placement of the driver side window controls. cup holders are odd, but functional. bmw is not known to provide good solutions for cup holders. hvac and radio control were good. winner &#150; slight favor to bmw in terms so quality feel. slight favor to g in terms of gadgets (hard drive for mp3, backup   safety  , cf capable, etc).   performance  : pontiac 5s - i like the growl of the   performance  . it is   performance  ful at higher rpms. it did not have the same pull at lower rpms as the  bmw . once the rpms got up there, it pulled well. the lack of low-end   performance   was noticeable on the g. bmw  &#150;   performance   sound was good. slight (very slight) turbo lab. the   performance   is awesome at all rpms (starting around 1500 rpm). the car was   performance  ful at any rpm. i was very, very impressed with the pull at any   performance  . felt like a v8.winner:  bmw . tranny: pontiac 5s - i expected this to be wonderful, but i was disappointed. the shifter vibrated way too much at all rpms, even at idle. it vibrated so much; i did not want to have my hand near it unless i needed to shift. the salesman told me this was normal. other than that, the tranny shifted well. bmw  &#150; shifted well. it did not have the uncontrolled vibrations like the g. winner:  bmw    performance   : pontiac 5s - the car handled well. it required more effort to keep in line with more aggressive driving. i am sure the suspension is capable of good   performance  , but imo it will also take more work on the driver&#146;s part to get there. the use of a lsd is a nice    technology nology nology  compared to the  bmw . the   safety   control  technology  shut down too hard when the wheels broke loose. bmw  &#150;it goes where you point it with lit acura e effort. i felt more in control of the car in nearly all situations. the   safety   control is much improved over previous gens. it did not shutdown the   performance     performance   as hard or easy as the previous gens or as the g. i also really like the    technology nology nology  where you can push the dtc button to allow more wheel slippage while still have the   safety   control kick in if the car gets completely out of control. this    technology nology nology  is not available in the g. winner &#150;  bmw msrp price:winner -  pontiac 5s &#150; the price is ~$8k lower than the  bmw .residual value: winner &#150;  bmw  &#150; 4% higher resale than the g &#150; bmw only costs $1640 more over 3 years (if car was sold at the stated residuals). this is much less than the $8k initial price diff of msrp. the cost difference will be higher (an adv for the  pontiac 5) if finance changes are factored in to my calc. $45k * .61 = $27,450 resale after 3 years &#150; total depreciation = $17,550 $37k * .57 = $21,090 resale after 3 years &#150; total depreciation = $15,910maintenance: winner bmw &#150; no cost for 4 year/50k miles pontiac 5s  toyota ted cost over 50k miles using the factory recommended service interval&#149;	3700 mile oil changes - $30/each = $390 for 13 oil changes&#149;	$300 service at 15k miles&#149;	$700 service at 30k miles&#149;	$300 service at 15k miles&#149;	$400    safety    at 30k miles &#150;  toyota ted need&#149;	total = $2090 over three years & 45k milestco: draw: the 3 year tco is nearly the same if finance charges are factored in. beyond 3 years is unknown (at least by my quick calculations)i do not have an allegiance to a particular marquee. the comments above are my opinions. my final conclusion is the bmw is the better alternative for me. the  pontiac 5 is a nice performing car and would be able to my needs for a high   performance   car if the  bmw  was not available. the driving  toyota mics in the bmw is much better (again, imo) that i can justify the initial price difference. my s toyota er-in-law and two friends have the g and love it. i am more of a driving enthusiast than them.my advice to others is to test drive both and buy the one that fits your driving   design   better. do not  ford  on 0-60 and other stats because this is not normal driving. the stats offer a quick comparison, but there is much more to a car&#146;s   performance   than running stop light to stop light.cheers!

"dynamos","November 2006"," my 2 cents. i purchased a 07  pontiac 5 with premium and auto. it was $11k less than a comparably equipped  bmw . while bmw does give you free maintenance, they only change the oil every 15k miles, which turns out to be only about 3 service visits over 48k miles. even with the synthetic oil i was never  toyota able with the long service interval. also, having owned both bmw and infiniti, i will take the reliability of infiniti over bimmer any day. further, infiniti provides a 70k   performance  train warranty compared to only 50k at bmw. also, my experience is dealer service is much better from infiniti--who provide a loan car for any service. getting a service loaner at bmw is always a hassle. "
"stl540","November 2006"," congrats on the new g. the three recommended visits over 45k miles for the  bmw  is a wonderful thing. time is precious and spending unnecessary time at a dealer is not appealing to me.i was also hes toyota ant on the l5k service interval. i posted the lab results of an oil change of my 540i a couple years ago. here is the link: s acura 540, ""bmw  bmw   sedan "" #8770, 18 apr 2004 5:03 pm!keywords=allin%3amsgtext%20limit%3abmw%3 audi %2520series%20s acura 540%20oil%20change. the results exceeded my expectations and would lead one to believe that the   performance  ers actually know what they are talking about.  i am surprised that infiniti still recommends 3700 oil changes when many (if not most) manufacturers recommend 7k+ service intervals. some car companies have been recommending a 15k mile interval over 7 years with success.neither infiniti nor bmw are known to be as reliable as honda or toyota. they both have their share of issues as they both push the envelope on   technology nology nology much more than hon or toy. i have examples (some personal) on good and bad experiences of infiniti and bmw. i had some major mechanical issues with my 540i outside of warranty. fortunately my dealer was able to get them covered for me. a friend of mine who owns a 2003  pontiac 5 had his car in the shop quite a bit. i also have friends with bmw's and infiniti's with higher mileage with minimal issues.my bmw dealer has been wonderful. i have a bmw loaner for any service visit. it definitely makes the experience much better. glad to hear your infiniti dealer treats you right.happy driving. enjoy the car.

"g35new","November 2006"," juat purchased a  pontiac 5s. had a 2002cic. this is not an attempt to compare apples to apples. the 330 had excellent    performance    and   performance  . great low end accelration. my issues with the car were:1) the   performance   was eating more and more oil between oil changes - i had to add 1.5 quarts (in small doses) after my last oil change and still have another 4k left until the next recommended oil change2)   design   quality issues: buttons for the windows had broken, the lit acura e pop out tray above the ashtray would not go in/out properly, the steering wheel wrapping was coming loose signfican acura y....and it was starting to   design   dated3)   design   items - the driver side window would not always adjust up and down properly. consequen acura y it would get caught in the up position against the soft top when the door was closed - if you have tried a bimmer convertible you know what i mean.4) the tires, for me, were magnets for any piece of metal on the road...mutiple blowouts, etc.5) the sport  seat  did not hold up very well and became un toyota able as the car ageddespite all that, i loved the car. i do think people should use caution and automatically say the   design   is far superior on a bmw.so the new  pontiac 5s is exciting and i am still trying to figure out how all the gagdets work. it handles well, accelration is good...neither quite at the 330 level, but quite acceptable.

"plekto","November 2006"," first off, my prices that i quoted were all from  car direct.com and are as such, verifiable.secondly, it's called rebates and incventives. that's how a 9-5 and a  volvo  can get down to such silly prices.thirdly, manual transmission is a must. almost every one of these  car  go from a rocket to your uncle's highway float-o-mobile(sm) when they are hampered with the automatic. nowhere is it more evident, though, than in the cadillac  cadillac . if you can't learn stickshift, just get a used midsize luxo-barge and be happy, because nothing under $30k(with an automatic) ex toyota s that i'd consider "" comfort "" and ""  performance  "".fourth, those ultra-small  car  almost all uni nissan lly fail the "" comfort "" definition as they are c dodge ped inside. there's nothing "" comfort "" to me if i feel like a sardine while i'm in it. compare a s40 to a  volvo . who cares wwhat volvo calls it, it's not a  comfort  car. neither is the  audi  or most of the rest. sure, they're made by  comfort  brands, but as their entry-level offering, it's not enough to have the name on it. even stuffing a bigger 6 cylinder   performance   won't most of the time as well. my ideal for  comfort  is an old mid 90's  mercedes . while none of these come close to that level, to be sure, i feel that they should still exhibit some of the qualities in part to be considered "" comfort "". and claustrophobic is the anthesis of  comfort  in my book. what ever happened to having a nice upright well-laid out   design  ? i'd much rather drive an old 80's bmw than most of these things. i'm 5'7"" and about 160lbd. pretty ""normal"", and when i turn the wheel hard(hand over hand   technology nology n toyota ue)and my left elbow hits the window, it's just not right. oh - while we're on the  volvo , i  toyota d a bare-bones t5 model with the bigger   performance  . under 30k and worth every penny. why not get ""not entry level"" for the same price?a few comments about some of the  car :the reality is that the  audi  is a maintainence nightmare. when i  toyota d they have to pull the   performance   halfway out to service it, i wasn't joking. that adds up to very pricey bmw-like maintainence. the cadillac catera also had this exact same problem. oh - and a minor point - can someone please smack audi upside their heads' over the joke of a cupholder?the bmw is a pathetic lit acura e thing like ths is250 is. not enough   performance   and not even close to the  bmw (or even the upper-end) model that made the entire line famous. and at under 30k, it's bare-bone at that. to me, it screams ""mercedes 190"" to me.the  mazda  - no bling - not  comfort  at all, but it is a sedan(i count 4 doors with their own hinges). i thought i'd add this since it represents the most rwd   performance   and    performance    that $25k(after rebates and incentves of course) can buy you.the  pontiac 5 - yes, you too noticed how the old models are better - the new one is like they are trying to copy a 350z. sigh. but the older generation with the manual gearbox is a joy to drive.the  cadillac  with the 3.6vvt   performance   and stickshift is an astounding machine. a bit ugly(okay, a lot ugly), but with 6   performance  s and 255hp, plus almost all of its   performance   available at 1600-2000rpm, it'll suck you back into your seat like nothing else will for the price. driving it, it reminded me of a softer-sprung upper-end 3 series or a new is300. sure, it has less hp, but it hits maximum   performance   at half the rpms as well, so it pulls hard like a turbo-diesel. all in all, none of them really fit the criteria perfec acura y. though, the  volvo  is probably the closest. but it's not really a ""fair"" comparison, either, as it's not entry-level. gotta love rebates  "
"kdshapiro","November 2006"," none of these  car  are  comfort   car . the segment is entry level  comfort  sport  sedan . manufacturers who make  comfort  automobiles, these are the bottom of the heap. last i   design  ed volvo or mazda don't make  comfort  vehicles.rebates and incentives will be gone in a few months for 2006 models. it's a pricing anomaly, much like black friday. comparing a 2006 volvo outgoing model with a new 2007  bmw  is ludicrous. the  bmw  is king of the entry level sport sedan.   performance  est, most planted, best   design  ing. to expensive? a  toyota  or  honda  is the ticket. i would rather pay $43k for a 335 than whatever for an  volvo . so would a lot of people i gather.of course, the  bmw  may not be right for you for a variety of reasons, none of which has to do with it's   performance  , unless you're afraid of it's 4.7 seconds to 60.one more thing - the tmv price  honda ing to edmunds is on par for the  volvo  vs  bmw . comparing the consumer ratings however, one is 9.5 the other is 7.7. can you guess which rating belongs to which car?i tried to do my car internet purchase. i tried  car direct.com, i ended up by not using them. i don't consider them to be the authority on pricing.

"plekto","November 2006"," yet their prices are legitimate enough. actually, you can haggle quite a better deal on many of the  car  if you want - i just use them as an example of ""average"" pricing for those who don't want to haggle or drive around.of course the bmw is going to be more favorable, but you can't get(still new) 2006 bmw for $26,400. the  volvo  t5, which isn't even their lowest end model is the same price as a  toyota  v6. i don't see mercedes or bmw or lexus offering those sorts of deals. and it's not ""black friday"" - it's a fact of life for gm, ford, chrysler, m toyota ubishi, mazda, and many others. for 3-4 months out of the year, you can get silly low prices on their leftover stock. that's not one weekend. it's roughly a third of the entire year, and when most sane people buy their new  car .(leases are totally seperate).as for the  volvo , it's certainly more luxurious than the others. the original poster wanted a  comfort  sedan that was sporty and luxurious for under 30k. this was different than the topic of this group, but we replied anyways. it's a higher sert of criteria that he was   design  ing for. and i suspect that the  volvo  will be a better solution than an  audi , as he seemed to want something a bit larger than a crackerbox if he could manage it.

"edwardsf","November 2006"," since you are a short guy, let me add a lit acura e bit of normal to large guy perspective. i am 6-2, with a long torso, meaning that most  car  have poor headroom or vision for me. the  volvo  has has a raked roof and i can't see well out of it. the lexus, 3 series, and the  pontiac 5 all have similar headroom or vision  problem . the  audi , c230 and  acura  all have more headroom and better vision for me. i have driven an  volvo  - extensively - from sf to  chevrolet  and back under all conditions. it is a good car. it has nice  seat  and even a usable back seat. but it does not perform  like the  audi  2.0t or the 3 series or the g or .... it does not handle as well as any of those  car  and it is not nearly as nimble and it does not have as much midrange usuable   performance   passing someone going up highway 50 at 5000 ft as even my 97 saab 900se. but you can go on about e series and 7 series in the entry   performance    level thread. and you can go on about poor reliability of  audi s (direc acura y contradicted by consumer repots) and something you made up about   performance  s bays (the s4 has a 4.2  in it so your claims are really bogus). but the reality is that you probably don't really care about helping out a buyer or fairly discussing entry level  comfort  perfomance  car . you seem to simply want crow about how great your  volvo  is. again, all the  car  discussed in this car are good  car . maybe if you tried driving more than one of them, you might see the light. that is, if you can see over the dash.

"kdshapiro","November 2006"," ""i agree with you about mazda ... but volvo??""maybe you are right. but, i don't think of volvo as a  comfort  car maker, in not the same way as infiniti or acura. infiniti has a high end model, acura has a high-end model. what is volvos' high-end model, the  volvo ? it's the same msrp as a 3 series. and saab? even though saab is on the l toyota  as an entry level vehicle, i don't think of them as being manufacturers of  comfort  automobiles.

"plekto","November 2006"," volvo is like lexus and infinity. they just dropped their budget-line back in the early 90s and never   design  ed back.(ie - the 700 and 240 series).the 850 turbo was one of the top three  comfort  sports  sedan  of the 90s - easily competing with the 3 series of the time.the  volvo  has more rounded sheetmetal, but it's still the same 850 at heart. a bit softer and more luxurious, but still very much a step up from a  toyota , honda, buick, misubishi, and so on. plus, it handles superbly. very ""european"" feel when you're driving it. oh, and it's safe as a tank. the last of the swedish   design  s as well. in a few years, ford will have gutted it and it'll be a re-badged  mercury . but for now, it's a good alternative to the overpriced stuff from japan.

"plekto","November 2006"," volvo's early h toyota ory is pretty easy to research, so i'll leave that out. what made them famous, though, was how they copied mercedes'   technology nology nology during the 60s, 70s and 80s - and reproduced it for 2/3 of the cost.mercedes came up with nearly every   safety   invention that volvo got its reputation for first - just who could afford a $12-15k sedan in 1967? volvo cost a lot less and offered the same   safety  (and preformance) this is why i have always considered them to be a  comfort  maker at heart. they are(or were) the european version of buick to mercedes' cadillac.other than the 240 and 700 series(plus some ill-fated budget  car  in europe like the 300 series), their  car  have always been aimed at providing a working-man's  comfort  alternative, exac acura y like lexus started off as. why buy mercedes and bmw when lexus offered 75-80% for half the price? see, i see four segements in the market.1:true budget.  chevrolet  and  toyota  and the like - you get a box that gets you areound.2:average car - about 60-70% of the market.3:budget  comfort . lexus, infinity, volvo, and so on.4:true  comfort . mercedes, ben acura ey, austin martin, bmw, lotus, saleen, and all the rest. stuff us working class people usually can't afford.now, there is some overlap between #3 and #4, like the mercedes c class and the top-end lexus models, but when someone posts here about wanting "" comfort "" and sets a low price-limit, it's clear that they are like 99% of us. they are really talking about category #3. and volvo and saab belong there.(the 9-2 aside - nobody wants a saabaru) "

"qbrozen","November 2006"," the guildeline seems to be the manufacturer builds  comfort   car , ultra- comfort  and exotics are excluded. the high-end sedan  volvo  does not compete with high-end offerings from bmw, mercedes and lexus although, you could argue it competes with the rl and the m45. having  toyota d that you can compare the options of the  volvo  with the rl and m45. for 300 hp it's a lot more expensive than then 335, which is not a  comfort  vehicle. if the  volvo  is included in the group, it is the most expensive vehicle here and the top of the line for volvo, while these other  car  are the bottom of the line for the other manufacturers. i don't think anyone will seriously compare the  volvo  against the 550, at least in terms of   performance  . maybe the  volvo  compares against the new 2008 600hp  cadillac v? i'm not sure i'm totally clear on this.are you comparing the  volvo  to the 550 just because it has a v8? the 550 is far more expensive. pricewise, the  volvo  compares closely to the rl. and, just as you say the  volvo  is the highest in the volvo lineup, so is the rl for acura and m45 for infiniti. so, again, if those manufacturers are in the entry-luxo class, than so must volvo be included. if we exclude one, then we must exclude all.

"fedlawman","November 2006"," you know pat, after i posted my last message last night, i started thinking that we might be wrong after all.i actually lost some sleep last night thinking about how i might have dismissed the ""car that must not be named"" a lit acura e prematurely. humor me before you delete this.we (i) dismissed the  lincoln  as a non-  performance   car from a non- comfort  marque, and that was that. last night, i wrote that the  lincoln  is not worthy because it's based largely on the mazd audi , which is more or less a pedestrian midsize car.here's what got me rethinking this - consider the acura  acura . you could argue that the  acura  is squarly in this segment - fwd yes, but peformance oriented, luxurious, high quality, and from an agreed upon  comfort  marque.but consider how much the  acura  and  lincoln  have in common. both are fwd and both share 95% of their dna with a 5-year old midsize car   design   (and the mazd audi  and  honda  are direct competitors in price,   performance  , and    technology nology nology s). both marques actually ex toyota  in their own lit acura e ""tweener"" band of near- comfort , not actually  comfort  like m-b, jaguar, and bmw.compare both  car  side-by-side,    technology nology nology  for    technology nology nology , and the  lincoln  and  acura  have a lot in common (hp, wheelbase, weight,    technology nology nology s, price, etc.).my conclusion? if the  lincoln  doesn't belong here, it's only because of lincoln's heritage as a plush car maker compared to acura's race heritage. acura's literature contains detailed specs about the  acura 's   performance      technology nology nology s (roll bar diameter, turns lock-to-lock, size and type of    safety   , dampeners, etc. while lincoln literature lacks any specifics. other than that, the two are pretty close on paper.one final point - i think perhaps that the base  acura  no longer belongs here for the same reasons that the  lincoln  doesn't. years have marched on and we now have the  acura -s - the base  acura  (which always was a lit acura e soft and floaty for my taste) now lacks a manual tranny option. all of the ""go-  performance  "" parts like thicker sway bars, 6-  performance   mt, etc. are all on the  acura -s. the base  acura  is arguably more like a buick than ever before.i'm sure many won't agree, but i feel guilty that i've wronged a competent car, and i want to make things right. after a lot more research on my part, the  lincoln  still isn't my kind of car, but i think it's more car than any of us have given it credit for.

"robbieg","December 2006"," i am not the used car expert but i highly doubt you can get a  cadillac  with the 3.6 and a stick shift for 15k,not to mention that one would be hard to find. with regard to the mercedes. the s500 coupes are not stick shift. you probably would have to   design   at the c230 to find a stick and i bet one would be hard to find because i doubt that many where sold with a stick. a c230 coupe with a stick would be easier to find but that is a coupe. also, i haven't priced  mazda s but i would guess that they are above 15k. the is300 came in a stick starting in 2002 and one of these may slide into your price range. sa  safety   are definitely in your price range but do you really want a used saab? with regard to volvo, an r is clearly out of your price range. you may find a t-5, but, like the saab, reliability may be an issue. i am not a bmw expert, so i will let someone else answer that one and let you know how old you will have to go to get below 15k. also, if  comfort  isn't necessarily you thing, you may want to try a  subaru .

"plekto","December 2006"," well, this i know.  a 2004  mazda  is closer to $12k if you shop around, but first year  car  are problematic. $15k can be had with some haggling on a 2005, though. los angeles is great that way - most everything sells for low trade-in(but dealers give you auction for trade-in as a result)i searched nationwide on three databases and found *one* s500 coupe from the mid 90s with a manual transmission - eviden acura y brought over from europe or something and converted to u.s. specs. just got me thinking is all. the maintainence is going to be rough on any large mercedes, especially 9 years old. i even found a local dealer who was ""willing"" to let me have a 2001 ml320 for $9k(?) due to the horrid reliability. i passed, of course. i even   design  ed at a couple of older 928s, but they are very very pricey to maintain. and 10-12 years old is more than pushing it for electrical and emissions equipment.the t5 and r volvos are only about 1-2k apart in value and they've been making them since oh, 1998 or so. i've had a sporty volvo in the past and it was fun, but fwd and 200+hp isn't my piece of cake, either, given how volvos have noticeable   performance  -steer when the turbo kicks in. finding a  volvo  from europe/canada with stickshift is unobtainium as well. maybe one every six months shows up for sale in the u.s.(only a couple of hundred over a decade were brought over this way via the european delivery prog dodge )the  cadillac ... yeah - $17k was the lowest i could haggle on one last week, but i just... i've been burnt by gm ""quality"" so many times... my last pre-ford/still swedish   design  ed and built volvo was bulletproof by comparison. shoot, my dad just spent $750 on his old buick for electrical. now, it's been very reliable up until now, but the electrical/  safety  s on the   performance   are starting to go at only 8 years old. 3 coil packs, a new maf, and a couple of other minor things.the  subaru  is out. sat in one and it was just nasty. very much love/hate ergonomics in it. the  subaru  was fine, though. i just worry about reliability is all.(though my cousin's new  subaru  seems to be perfec acura y fine - and   performance   as stink)bmw - my knowledge ends at about 1995.now if only something like the celica ex toyota ed with rwd, four doors, and had a back seat big enough to fit my 8yr old son. i'd so love a 350z if it had a back seat.   design  s like it could easily fit one, but the geniuses at nissan decided to fill the rear in with empty  comfort /a shelf the size of a couple of huge subwoofers instead.so far the c230/c320 is edging towards the top due to their poor resale value. :p $12995 asking price at about 5 local dealers for a 2003 coupe. the 230 sedan or 320 coupe is $15k - and that's before haggling.edit:concerning the bmw 5 series:2000  bmw  $11,376 $12,975 $14,702like the price, but how reliable are they? should i get the v8 model instead(though it seems awfully heavy at 3600+ lbs) "

"nyccarguy","December 2006"," well, if you really don't want to compromise then why do you think you need an awd bmw? where do you live? go for a  bmw  coupe (rwd) with a sports package & 6-  performance   manual transmission. get a set of 4 dedicated winter tires/wheels for the few months of winter.an awd bmw will be heavier which will adversely affect  safety  &    performance    in wet, snowy, & dry conditions. your fuel economy will also suffer in an awd car vs. its rwd counterpart. the awd bmw will also cost you more $ upfront.you're worried about    safety    in snowy & icy conditions? an awd car with 4 dedicated winter tires will accelerate better from a complete stop than the same rwd car with 4 dedicated winter tires. awd may help you get going, but that extra 242 pounds (2007 bmw  bmw  vs. 328xi sedan from bmw na's website) could be the split second you need to stop from hitting a deer or swerve to avoid an accident. many people equate awd with   safety   and therefore do not put a set of dedicated winter tires on their awd equipped  car . they feel that the all season tires equipped on thier awd car will do the trick. do they wear the same pair of shoes to the office, formal function, the gym...? no. what is the only thing on your car that touches the ground? tires!

"allargon","December 2006"," if you don't like the   design   of the  cadillac , then the new re  design   probably won't do much for you. i declined to buy an acura  acura  recen acura y despite loving the size, driving  toyota mics (complaints about the fwd and turning circle are imho overblown) and   design   of the car because every time i   design  ed at it in my garage i would think i can't believe i bought an  honda ! :sick: (yes, i know the suspension,   performance  , gadgets, make it so much more. but, it   design  s like an  honda  despite the body kit.)i love the in your face   design   of the  cadillac . a lot of people don't like american styling. (they can buy the mazd audi  instead of the ford  ford  or the toyota  toyota  instead of the pontiac  pontiac .) however, a lot of people don't like the   design  s of japanese  car , either. the only reason there's no  cadillac  in my garage now is due to the   design  . i can handle the angular padding on the doors and dash and the cheap plastic (the  pontiac 5 has plenty, too), but that center stack instrument panel just hurts my eyes too much.pricing? cadillacs were never cheap  car . imho, they shouldn't be. part of the decline of their status of a brand in addition to the quality decline is the fact that there are so many cheaper, older ones on the road. in europe, there are plenty of older audis on the road (""pimp my ride"" and ""top gear"" showcase them all the time.), but i almost never see older audis in the us.residuals? the  cadillac  actually held its value pretty well considering it was an american car. (the sts? ouch, 35k worth of depreciation in two years.) it actually did well in this class. the japanese 3 (acura, infiniti, lexus) in this class hold their values better than the european ones.100mph in the 1/4 mile? yeah, a lot of folks mentioned the rally  car . 50k? how about adding the  cadillac -v,  chrysler c st8 and the boxster s (base) as contenders. (note: i was too lazy to actually   design   up the #'s to see if they belong.) "
"circlew","December 2006"," i do like what i see of the new   design   of the '08  cadillac  but i need to sit in it to really decide. the acura was ok when i shopped in '05 but i did not drive it. i test drove the  pontiac 5 coupe but i decided on a sedan and the g sedan is not my taste either, although the '07   design  s far better. the coupe handled great and was fat but wind noise was apparent and room and   design   did not do it for me. cadillac lost some of it's appeal due to quality and image loss to the elps segment. the  cadillac  is a nice try but as usual, missed the mark, imo.i did test drive the 300c srt8 and it was great but mileage/residual was a killer. i made my decision toward the end of '05 before $78/barrel hit. i am glad i went with the xi.regards,ow "

"nyccarguy","December 2006"," i'm an admitted import fan (bmwcca member) and gm hater (after owning a 1992 chevrolet beretta gt as my first car i have every right to). without getting into the politics of unions or the whole american vs. the imports discussion (way ot), in order for the upcoming  cadillac  to be at least competitive in this segment it has to wow people. it needs a well   design  ed   design   with high quality materials, excellent   performance   from even the base model (will the motor from the satunr  saturn  xr fit a rwd caddy?) including   performance  , balance, ride &    performance   , narrow & even body panel gaps, it has to be reliable... otherwise the new  cadillac  will be available for purchase with 0% financing for 72 months with employee pricing, massive rebates, free navigation  technology , & buy one get one free.

"plekto","December 2006"," don't forget that the  cadillac  also can be had with a manual transmission and is rwd. that's worth a lot to people who want a car for less than a bmw - but with better reliability and a softer ride. it's definately cheaper than a  pontiac 5 or lexus.and to be honest, what's next? 4 second times and 400hp being considered ""weak""? we've already crossed the threshold of what most consumers require in a car in terms of   performance   and   performance  , so you have to   design   at the total picture. for instance the gm 3.6   performance   - no hp monster, but it's essentially a honda or toyota   performance   tewchnology-wise with the vvt - but in a car that is well under $30k.(buick  buick  cxs) it's a very nice total package that competes well against the japanese  car  in real-life driving.

"robbieg","December 2006"," don't most cadillac buyers buy the moonroof, automatic, leather and most of the  comfort  options. if bought this way, your are over 30k even with the incentives. also, if you buy a manual transmission  comfort  car without a moonroof your resale will be terrible and i would imagine it would be even worse because i don't think there are too many buyers who want a manual cadillac. las acura y, up north, heated  seat  are a required    technology nology nology  in any  comfort  car. again, i think that an automatic  cadillac  with the typical options except for nav. should be priced from the start at less than 30,000.

"habitat1","December 2006"," lexus can get the vote as the   performance  est of the three in a straight line. and perhaps the best of the three in pure  comfort  accutriments. but, if we are talking about entry level ""sport""  sedan  and willing to forgive the fact that the lexus' back seat is marginally bigger than the one in my 911......how in the hell isn't a manual transmission option an   safety  olute requirement for entry? i mean we are not talking about 5 passenger  comfort   sedan  here. for which, by the way, the 550i benchmark still has a manual transmission option. but in the case of the is350, we are essentially talking about a 2+2. the  bmw  has a bigger back seat. forget the debate about advertising bribes. we all know toyota is on track to become the largest automaker in the world next year. but how can road and track explain degenerating into thinking that the best 0-60 and the straight 1/4 mile in a slushbox is the metric for sportiness in this category of car?this is not to say that the is350 isn't a very nice  comfort  and maybe even ""sport-y"" car. but if one can achieve top ""sport"" billing in this segment with a slushbox, what the hell's next? an amg r63 mi chevrolet n being crowned the top sports car in the world because it can carry more pounds of professional athletes   performance  er through the 1/4 mile than a ferrari 430 and porsche 911 turbo?r&t really needs to explain their definition of ""sport"". it certainly doesn't match mine.

"fedlawman","December 2006"," how many of you have driven the new  pontiac 5?i took a test drive about 10 days ago and came away very lukewarm. it's   performance   feels soft. the clutch take up is sudden, making  comfort  shifts next to impossible. this difficulty was compounded by the most glaring fault - throt acura e response. i'm sure it's the drive-by-wire software, but it had a very detached feel to it, and revs hung so high and long that when you try to heel&toe, the revs actually leap up a few hundred rpm before they slowly start to decay. it was the most unnatural, awkward, and difficult to shift car i've driven in a long time. it's a car that you don't set acura e into and immediately feel  toyota able driving.i will say that i liked the   design  , and the suspension tuning was spot on for this segment. it had just enough cabin isolation to be ""near-luxurious"" but you could still hear and feel the road just the right amount. personally, i'd take the  acura  over the  pontiac 5 and is.

"louiswei","December 2006"," are you getting rid of your is or just having fun?oh, i was just having a lit acura e fun testing out  car  in this segment. i plan on keeping my is350 for a while. like i  toyota d, i went to check out the  pontiac 5s and  bmw  today, also got a chance to test drive them both. followings are my observations. pontiac 5s:i like the   design     design   a lot. for some reason even though the general   design   remains the same, it   design  s like a completely new car and better   design  ing. good job, infiniti. however, not a big fan on the new grill though.   design   is definitely light years ahead of the older model. even though the ""washi"" aluminum received some criticism, i'd have to say i like it. however, by   design  ing closely, one can still find cheap plastic being used so i think the g's   design   is still behind its competitors.   performance   wise, i like the g's sharp steering a lot. paddle shifter works nicely, no time delay when up/down shifting like the is. the suspension is obviously softer than the older model but still very adequate for a car in this class. the biggest disappointment for me is the   performance  . if i had not known its specs before i'd never guess that it has the same hp output as my is350 (306 hp). it is not peppy at all below 3000 rpm. even above that mark it still doesn't feel like an   performance   with over 300 hp. bmw :this is the car i afraid to drive the most because i was worried that i might like it so much and couldn't control the urge to trade in my is350. however, after the test drive, all my worries went away. that being  toyota d, the  bmw  didn't disappoint. as matter of fact, if money is not an issue, this is definitely the ride i'd like to have in my driveway. i was never a fan of the current  bmw '   design   but i think i can live with it if i have to. the material used for the   design   is top notch of course but i prefer lexus' and acura's   design  . steering is typical bmw, sharp and precise, no doubt it's the benchmark of the class. the   performance   is definitely the shining star of this car and boy is it fun to drive or what. hones acura y i couldn't feel any turbo lag and it has  comfort    performance   from low rpm all the way up to red line. it is definitely quicker than is350 at below 2500 rpm but pass that i'd say they are pretty even. however, will all the goodies this car has to offer if i am in the market today to buy an ellps i would pass on the  bmw . why? its hefty sticker. with sports package, premium package,  toyota  access and metallic paint, the msrp comes to a lit acura e bit over $46k. that's $10k over what i paid for my is350 and the only things it has more are the   technology nology , heated  seat  and upgraded sports suspension. to me, those things are definitely nice but not $10k nicer. bottom line: the  bmw  is obviously the best car in this class but best buy? not to me.

"louiswei","December 2006"," scottm123, if you must have awd then i think your best choice (or best bang for the buck) right now is the  pontiac 5x. no doubt the  bmw x will be nicer and more   performance  ful but that's if you can get over that price. i personally don't care much about the is250 and would never choose it over the  pontiac 5x.  acura -s is nice but if i am going to drop around $35k on a car i'd like to have either awd or rwd.just my 2 cents.

"habitat1","December 2006"," not to take sides on your debate with blueguydotcom, but after reading through these posts, i do believe that your personal price comparison between a stripped is350 and loaded  bmw  is disingenous at best, deceitful at worst. maybe not for you personally, based upon your ""ideal"" configuration. but that $10k difference that you come up with is not something that 1% of other buyers would ever experience - and claim that both  car  are comparably equiped based upon their own preferences.also, although i knew you were less of a ""driving enthusa toyota "" than me (my manual transmission requirement vs. your acceptance of an auto), i didn't realize that you were that ambivalent to driving  toyota mics. if that's the case, i'm not sure why you aren't driving a  acura , which would have saved you another $5-7k+ and given you a boa acura aod of standard equipment that the is350 lacks. apples to apples, that's the only $10k difference we have here, far greater than the difference between the is350 and  bmw . if the    performance   , steering and other  toyota mic advantages of that sport package equiped  bmw  are not worth anything to you, than neither should the fact that the  acura  is fwd be a de   safety   , given that its actual on road    performance   , steering, etc. is at least comparable to the is. in your cost comparison, what i would see as significant   performance   and    technology nology nology  differences are deemed irrelevant by you. yet you are willing to pay more for an   design   wheel upgrade than i would have paid for on my ""other"" car. it seems to me that your cost benefit analysis of the is350 vs.  bmw  is based heavily on image and not a lot on substance. which is certainly your perogative, but i don't think it is typical of ellps shoppers. certainly not the ones that are ""p"" oriented, but probably not even the ""l"" oriented ones.

"plekto","December 2006"," also remember that the capability of today's tires are vas acura y better than even a decade or two ago. it's all based upon the tire's maximum weight rating and the contact area.rim size actually has lit acura e or nothing to do with this for anything less than a true sportscar. 15 inchers are more than adequate, for instance, for even a is350 if they are the right profile, for 99.9% of drivers.but consumers equate bigger rims with better    performance   , much like how they worship horse  performance  . but all that gets you is tires that are worse in curves and in the rain that are also more expensive to replace. thinner, taller tires are more  toyota able to ride on, wear better, and turn quicker. but you obviously can't be going super thin/tall, either. but something like a 235/75/15 is more than adequate for anything on the road these days(note - used to be a truck tire - now it can be found on a few higher-end  car ) my 67 mercedes had 185/80/13s on it and never had a problem with    safety   . $200 for a set, and not the cheapest tires, either, but good michelins.the suspension also has to be dialed in as hard as a rock to utilize low-profile tires as well(or they wear unevenly), so you get a harder ride. it's a lose-lose situation for anything short of a saleen or lotus elise or  dodge .(ie - no  comfort  here - pure   performance   is all you get)oh, and again - they are silly expensive. $150 a tire isn't my idea of low cost of ownership. not when a $60 tire would have done the same job.

"joe131","December 2006"," nope.tire tread wear ratings are only useful when comparing tires made by the same manufacturer. a 400 rating in one brand may wear out sooner than a 300 rating of another brand.http://www.discounttire.com/dtcs/infotreadwear.dos puts it like this:the treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear of a tire when tested carefully under controlled conditions. for example, a tire graded 400 should have its useful tread last twice as long as a tire graded 200. another tire manufacturer, however, may grade a comparable   design   300, so a grade of 150 would last just half as long under their grading scheme. the lesson learned is to not use one manufacturer's grade versus the other, but instead to compare tire grades within a given brand.

"joe131","January 2007"," what is your authority stating bmw warranty covers dinan   performance   chips? i could not find any support for it.but i did read a lit acura e which tends to show you may be in for big warranty headaches if there is   performance   failure in a re-chipped car.consider these tidbits from the bimmerfest message board:1. he (dinan) actually does void the (bmw) factory warranty... he just states that he matches it if there is an issue... if there is a problem, bmw will not cover, and (if) you can prove that it was dinan's fault.. then dinan pays... if you cannot prove it was dinan's fault... and bmw will not cover... you are hosed (s.o.l.)! (and remember, unless you pay a whole lot extra,the dinan warranty only lasts until the original bmw factory warranty expires.)2. all dinan produ cadillac  void bmw's warranty. it's just that dinan offers a (concurrent) warranty to supposedly cover any warranty denials by bmw. but dinan produ cadillac  do void the bmw warranty.3. (here i am paraphrasing an entry posted by a lawyer)if you make a claim for bmw warranty coverage and bmw decides (as it almost certainly will in the event of   performance   failure where a dinan chip is installed) that bmw does not need to pay for the repair, you will need to go to court to pursue your claim further. and once there, even though the burden is on bmw to prove that the dinan chip caused the damage, it probably would not be a difficult thing for a jury to find. and when the jury does find the aftermarket chip was the cause, the bmw warranty is voided for that damage claim. so then you end up with a claim against the dinan warranty. but to win against dinan, you as a plaintiff must prove that the dinan chip caused the damage. if you don&#146;t get a jury to agree on that, you lose and the dinan warranty will not pay either. and even before many months or years waiting to get to the courtrooms, you either pay out of your pocket for the repairs, or do without the car as you hope one warranty will eventually be forced to cover the damage.bottom line: do not re-chip your bmw while it is under the factory warranty.

"spiritinthesky","January 2007"," blueguydotcom,i generally agree with your posts and appreciate your  honda s. however, i have some disagreement with your most recent one:my nephew recen acura y purchased a  bmw  sedan. while it diplays impressive   performance   for a ""regular"" 3 series, the overall   performance   still falls well short of the  bmw , especially in the area of    performance   . what d toyota inguishes the  bmw  from all of its competition is near 911 quality steering and    performance   . you don't get that with an aftermarket dinan chip. and the  bmw , while an ellps segment leader, will never play with a 911 around a track, chipped or not. secondly, as others have pointed out, the dinan chips do indeed pose a warranty risk. a significant one. i have several fellow  bmw  owners who have   design  ed into it and all concluded that you better have the intestinal fortitude to go to court. thirdly, hand built ""m""   performance  s are at least 3+ times as expensive to produce as their non-m mass produced counterparts. if you've ever visited both factories, as i have, you immediately know why. while i don't dispute that the profit margins on the  bmw  and  bmw  are high, most of that is because 90% of m models are sold at full msrp, with no discounting or ed discounts. my nephew bought a  bmw  for the equivalent of $1,500 under us invoice via european delivery. for those that might think the difference between a  bmw  and an  bmw  is a 0-60 time that can be bridged by a dinan chip, i respectfully suggest they don't really know what motorsports is all about and what separates them from the horse  performance   addicted drag racers over at amg. sorry if i sound defensive. my loyalty to ""m"" goes back to being an original owner of an m1. it's pretty easy to pump the   performance   of a turbo   performance  . a hell of a lot harder to live by the mantra, ""make the chassis   performance  er than the   performance  "". and nobody in the sport sedan and coupe market does that better than motorsports.

"fedlawman","January 2007"," if an authorized dinan bmw dealership sells and installs your dinan parts, then you're covered. period.time for my soapbox...i would point out that even the factory warranty on an unmodified car can be ""muddy"" in certain cases. for example, if your clutch burns out after only 15,000 miles, is it a defective tranny or did you destroy it with abuse? this exact situation has happened to people on these very forums (including myself 2 years ago with my old acura), and the decision whether the dealership covered the repairs or not seems to be about 50/50.the parts and service folks at my local bmw dealer all know me by first name - and i've never spent more than $50 there at a time. i'm in there probably a couple times each month to buy a $6 oil filter, $3 worth of 7mm screws, or something like that. that's it. they always smile and say hello when i come in, talk about e30's for a few minutes, and then, half the time, they give me my parts for free. if it's not in stock, they have even overnight drop shipped parts to my home - no charge.when i brought my acura in with a moaning clutch 2 years ago, no questions were asked. the acura dealer took care of me without hesitation. other people have not been so lucky. why? imo, your automobile is one of your biggest investments, and like your accountant, lawyer, or bank branch manager, you should have a personal relationship with the people who help you take care of it. if you're an enthusiast (and what dinan customer isn't to some extent), you should want to be an ""insider"" with the dealership people who are ""in the know.""you'll never have a problem with warranty support, dinan modified or bone stock, if you do this.

"spiritinthesky","January 2007"," thanks for the clarification, but please note that i did qualify my previous post with:""and if a loaded  pontiac 5 actually costs $40k"" i wasn't aware of the accuracy of that figure and i accept your correction that the difference in purchase price is closer to $5k. however, i would still subtract from that difference 4 years and 50k miles of maintenance included in the bmw. not sure what that would cost on the infiniti. hopefully a lot less than the $6,000 i just  toyota ted for my new 911 turbo. but likely at least $1,500 if they do decent 10k mile interval services.bottom line is that full and accurate financial comparisons should be done before jumping to any conclusions. i might think that an extra ""net"" $3,500 for the  bmw  up front is a great deal, since it will likely be worth $5k+ more in 3-4 years than the infiniti and offer a lot more rewarding of a driving experience in the meantime. but i respect that for some, an extra $5,000 up front is a straw breaking the camel's back. but at least we should be   design  ing at the same accurate cost figures and the full picture, including maintenance and resale values, when we reach our own subjective conclusions. if it is down to nickels, one should also   design   at insurance costs and gas mileage. but i hope that it doesn't need to get to that level for a $40k ellps. after all, there are many nice $25k  car  for those who need to be a bit more prudent than shooting their wad at a young(er) age.

"spiritinthesky","January 2007"," if you are interested in learning more about the bmw european delivery prog dodge , go to your local dealer and ask for an explanation. it does have some trade offs - you need to order the car, pay for it upon production and there will be a delay of 3-4 weeks after your ""pick up"" trip to germany and when you actually have the car delivered to you (through the local dealer) back in the us. the basic ed savings is about 7% off the us msrp. many dealers will tell you this is ""non-negotiable"". wrong. just tell them that a friend (i'll volunteer) told you that his dealer will further discount the ed price to $1,500 over the ed invoice. the dealer mark up on ed is basically the same percentage as the invoice to msrp markup on a us car. so there is definitely room to get another 4-5% off the ed price.another secret: the ed  car  do not come out of a dealers ""allocation"" for us sales. so when a car is ""hot"", like the  bmw  is right now, a dealer might not want to discount a us delivered much, since he will only be getting a limited number of units. but if he sells you a car via european delivery, its a ""bonus"" sale that counts towards dealer incentives from bmw, but doesn't reduce the number of  bmw 's he will get to sell here. i've pretty much told you everything i know. i only pay cash for  car , so i'm not  mazda r with the financing or lease options avaliable through ed. but i'm sure the dealer can help you there.this is not an attempt to dissuade you from getting a  pontiac 5. but given your ""circumstances"", i would also suggest considering a  acura . less expensive still, wery good   performance   (fwd notwithstanding), all the do-dads you could want, better fit and   design  , and excellent resale. thank my nephew for that assessment.good luck.

"blueguydotcom","January 2007"," t waa right about the time when the is350 came out and all the 3 series owners were telling is350 sup toyota rs that ""hp doesn't matter- what's the point?"" & ""yeah- that's great for straight line   performance  ."" the is 350 blew the competition away when it first came out w/ the amount of raw   performance   it offered and everyone chuckled at the is owners about straight line   performance  .having driven an is350, i can say straight it went like a bat out of hades. but once you came to a corner you were con suzuki d with lousy roadfeel, a yacht-like suspension and poor chassis   performance  . that still stands. on a track the is350 would quickly fall to the e46 zhp, 06 e90 zsp, any  pontiac 5 and probably most  acura s and  audi s. guess what- infiniti and bmw responded because they recognized the obvious hp threat from lexus.no, they realized americans aren't too bright. we see a big hp number and think a car is good - hence the success of piggy  car  like the 300c. so bmw and infiniti offer ""on-paper"" hp comparable to an is350 but of course the driving  toyota mics of the two far outshine the is.now your telling me that your gloating over the amount of hp the  bmw  has?? c'mon. if the  bmw  didn't come out when they did,  bmw  owners would still be saying ""straight line   performance  "" and ""hp"" doesn't matter. it's how well the car handles and blah blah blah. i'll admit that the hp in that  bmw  is impressive and is class leading (not literally). it's a great alterative the the e46  bmw .we mention it because in a straigh acura ine the  bmw  takes the is350. then the first corners come. uh-oh, it takes the corners   performance  er than the is350. by the end of a track run with the same driver you'd get times that are decidedly in favor of the bmw. before you'd win out because you'd still take the tw toyota ies   performance  er than the waffling is can handle. essentially, the car's the complete package. no matter what lexus does to the is in terms of hp - like the silly is-f - the car will still be saddled with poor steering, poor roadfeel, junky tranny and a lousy chassis.

"shouldiwait","January 2007"," you are a lit acura e misinformed. it seems quite proper to compare one sports sedan to another, same category and class seems fair to me. you are biased when you thought your  acura  was   performance  er and handles better than the type s. the latter has more horse  performance   and has a revised and improved suspension. i had an s2000 and yet i thought this type s handles quite well. as far as it feeling slower than your  acura , you must allow a car to break in a lit acura e to feel the added   performance  - perhaps after 5 or so thousand miles. in addition, i think you felt restraint from pushing when you test drove it and i am sure you did not use the paddle shift sport mode.regarding the fwd and rwd comparison, the latter generally handles much better. however, you need to read the upcoming road and track magazine on the is350, type s and the new g comparison. the type s actually did very well.my main point is about what you get for driving experience/pleasure and money. i am very happy with my decision. i still own the 2000 bmw and i would not buy another bmw from a financial standpoint. i am a lawyer and can easily afford a 335 but logic tends to dictate my decision.

"plekto","January 2007"," 3 - you can push-start a manual in an emergency.4 - you can tow a manual easily.5 - a failing transmission will give you months of warning as opposed to *blocks*. automatics literally can fail in the  comfort  of half a mile. then it's a rock. the manual can be shifted carefully without a clutch at all, in fact - if you know the gearing and shift points. and most  car  can be driven to the shop just fine in 2nd gear.6 - you drive the car instead of it driving you. case in point - a downhill sweeping curve. the automatic will upshift while you can keep it in third to   performance   up the hill in a few hundred feet after the turn(typical of many mountain roads)7 - better gearing ratios. zero lag-time to spool up to the proper   performance   for quick transitions.8 - the ability to get by with a lot smaller   performance  . better mpg and less weight.and, yes, it's tons cheaper to fix. $350-500 plus labor will get you a racing clutch put in most  car . a typical clutch job runs about 500-600, so $1000 is a bmw or something overkill for most  car .the only two things you gain fom an automatic are:1 - idiot-proofing - anyone can drive it. (also, there's no physical or mental reason a woman can't learn as well as a man how to use a manual)2 - not having to shift in a traffic-jam. note - i counted - two traffic jams on friday here in l.a. i shifted 4 times in the first one and 6 times in the second. they both covered more than ten miles. i just planned and kept my   performance   at where i didn't need to shift endlessly. the idea that you need to shift 50+ times... someone's been feeding you a line.

"designman","January 2007"," why is bmw, a recognized  comfort  car when they still offer standard vinyl  seat  ? i think it's just a matter of keeping msrp as low as possible, then zapping you with the options. when people hear leatherette, the knee jerk response is e-e-w-w-w-w. and if you mention leatherette to the sales people, they intimidate you with resale etc. buyers will spend years trying to figure out how save money when getting a new car, but mention the l word and you get a catatonic stare. the thinking is that leatherette is tantamount to being castrated. you have to admit, the tactic works.

"fedlawman","March 2007"," i think it depends on how you define a ""bigger car.""is the cadillac at a disadvantage because it is longer bumper-to-bumper? or is it because the wheelbase is longer? maybe the cadillac has an advantage because it weighs 100 lbs less than the bmw?i suspect all have an effect, but ultimately, it comes down to solid   performance  ering and long-term refinement. the bmw handles better because it is purpose built to be (and h toyota orically is) better. an evolutionary vs. revolutionary   design   is what makes the bmw #1 in ride/   performance   . cadillac came up with the brand-new rwd sigma platform 5 years ago - bmw has 30 years of e21, e30, e36, e46, e90 evolution. the sigma platform is very competent (and the 2008  cadillac  (sigma ii) should be even better), but it won't be a match for bmw for a long, long time. "
"joe131","March 2007"," for purposes of ellps, i'll define bigger in terms of passenger and cargo room. the more of those there is, the harder and more expensive it is to make an excellent    performance    and performing car.usually, if you have more passenger and cargo room, your car will also be heavier and dimensionally larger too. (for example, ben acura ey, not an ellps, is a major exception with its subcompact luxo- car .) it is also usually easier and cheaper (less complex   performance  ering) to build a lit acura e box stiffer than a bigger box. try it with cardboard, you'll see. put wheels on a stiff box and it handles better than a flimsier box.porsches are lit acura er than  bmw . and porsches handle and perform better.if you build lit acura er  car  (bmw), you have an advantage in    performance    and   performance   over what the builders of bigger  car  (cadillac) have.it is about compromises. bmw compromises by making its  car  lit acura e inside so they can handle and perform better than bigger  car . cadillac thinks its customers will appreciate the extra room in exchange for compromises in    performance   .it's nice to have choices.

like i  toyota d earlier, compared to an  honda , maybe so, compared to a  bmw  or a  bmw , not happening. as for my not personally liking the  cadillac , uhhh, well, after driving it, it wasn&#146;t hard. fwiw, shor acura y after i bought my 2002 530i 5-  performance  , i took a drive in a  cadillac . i have no idea who or what opined that the  cadillac  was a legit contender, but i have to question its motives. those two  car  were as different as night and day and there is no way the  cadillac  of that era was even qualified to sniff the fumes of the 530i.you keep equating my critical opinions of the  cadillac  because i don&#146;t like it. the point you&#146;re missing is that i didn&#146;t initially like it because besides being ugly inside and out, the early version of the  cadillac  that i drove was a poorly executed, noisy rat acura e trap that had sloppy    performance   , an anemic   performance  , crappy ergonomics and un toyota able  seat . yeah, i didn&#146;t like it, and for good reason too.&#148;you are saying the the is was way too small but the 3 series was spacious? ok, thats the first i've heard of that.&#148;obviously you have yet to take a   design   yourself. iirc, bluebuydotcom posted a picture of his legs first inside of an is and then inside of an e90. those pictures illustrated what my kids found out very well. in this case, even the paper specs agree. don&#146;t believe me?   design   it up.&#148;you say you value manual trannies and the  cadillac  has one but you are trashing the  cadillac . interesting.&#148;you&#146;re pretty funny. the first couple of times i went into a cadillac dealership to drive a manual  cadillac  i had the sales person actually tell me that i didn&#146;t really want to drive a manual. when pressed, i was told by the salesman from both dealerships that not only did they not have any manual  cadillac s in stock, they&#146;ve never even had one in and never would. at that point i had nothing left to lose, so i asked about ordering one. once again, in both cases the dealerships refused to even consider the option, &#147;we won&#146;t order one because we know that you don&#146;t really want a manual transmission and that in the end, you&#146;ll stick us with the car and demand an automatic version instead.&#148;fwiw, just about a year ago i did manage to happen upon a dealership that had a 6-  performance   in stock and they were only too happy to let me drive it, i suppose the figured they&#146;d finally found a sucker to unload it on, anyway, it drove okay, and while the transmission was  comfort er and easier to shift than the one in my 1970  dodge , it was still stiff and clunky compared to the tranny in the e60. that  toyota d, i believe that both transmissions are made by getrag, so i&#146;m at a loss to explain the difference. shifter maybe?other thoughts on last years&#146; drive of the  cadillac ; the   design     design  ed about as horrid as the early  car  that i drove, however, at least it was screwed together better and had much better fit. the   performance   had also been d dodge atically improved over the early models, so much so that i&#146;d even go so far as to say that it was competent. not as  comfort  as an i6, but then no v6 is so no loss there. that  toyota d, the car&#146;s suspension was still sloppy, the  seat  were still un toyota able, and the ergonomics still weren&#146;t ergonomic.&#148;most people like the new  cadillac    design  . do you read any online or print car mags?&#148;ummm, do you rely on the car magazine for all of your opinions?

"fedlawman","March 2007"," i'm getting sick of all this  cadillac , m-b, bmw bashing. all this talk about the  cadillac  and m-b  mercedes  is really splitting hairs. i think some people on the boards (myself included) are sometimes guilty of exaggerating their feelings a lit acura e for the sake of making a point. the point may be valid, but imo, the gulf that separates these  car  is not the chasm that some would have you believe.sure the  cadillac  isn't as tight or nimble as the bmw, but it is still a fine entry-lux sport sedan. if you like the   design  s and the feel, and get a screaming deal at purchase, it can be a fine choice. the  mercedes  is another bird altogether. the m-b (with sport suspension) is right up there with the bmw in ride/   performance     toyota mics, it has a bank vault rigid body structure, and it has a  comfort , refined demeanor. quality has been a problem, and some   design   plastics are cheap, but perhaps the new  mercedes  addresses these issues.the lexus is didn't live up to the pre-release claims of building a better  bmw  - so what? although, when driven side-by-side with the bimmer, the lexus lacks steering feel and    performance    response, taken on it's own merits, it's still a very competent sport sedan with the bonus of high quality materials and outstanding expected reliability.the challenge manufacturers have in this most competetive segment is choosing who they want their buyer to be, and then making a car for them. infiniti is a fine example. the previous generation  pontiac 5 was a great    performance   , snorting stomping, fun-to-drive sport sedan. unfortunately, infiniti l toyota ened to the complaints about nvh (noise, vibration, and harshness) and cheap   design   quality, and they ""fixed"" those issues - at the expense of responsive    performance    and tight  toyota mics. imo, infiniti has turned the  pontiac 5 into a buick and ruined it. yeah, we have a tendency here to describe molehills as though they are mountains. those of us with track experience (more of us here than you think) can feel and appreciate the undeniable edge that bmw's possess over their very fine competition, and we're not willing to sacrifice even a drop of   performance   in return for electro-luminescent instruments or perforated leather  seat . others here are   design  ing for a different blend of  comfort  and sport and probably can't tell or don't care about the sub acura e differences in driving  toyota mics of any of the  car  on this l toyota . bottom line - none of these  car  are pure sports  car . they are too heavy and possess too many compromises for the sake of refinement,  comfort , styling, room, and price. the car you buy should be the car that possesses the balance of these traits that most appeals to you and fits your life  design  .

"fedlawman","March 2007"," the $38,230 price i quoted for the cadillac  cadillac  turns out to be for the ""sport"" model with 18"" wheels, sport suspension, and few other options.the  cadillac  that most closely compares to a base  bmw  with optional leather seating is the ""3.6l standard"" model. with optional   performance   moonroof (the bmw comes with one), the caddy stickers for $34,630. the bmw without the seat heaters (this  cadillac  doesn't come with them either) has an msrp of $34,545.also for reference, msrp's (rounded off) for some of the other ellps's:acura  acura  - $34,000;  acura -s - $38,000lexus is250 - $31,000; is350 - $36,500infiniti  pontiac 5 - $34,000bmw  bmw  - $39,500m-b c230 - $30,500; c350 - $39,000audi  audi  2.0t - $30,000; 3.2 - $36,000here's my take on this class:if you're shopping for an auto transmission equipped ellps, i think the  pontiac 5 pretty much offers the best bang for the buck (hp,    performance   ,  comfort , quality,    technology nology nology s, etc). if you're shopping for an ellps with a manual transmission, things get more interesting. the  pontiac 5 is out of contention because it's  infiniti  drivetrain just sucks. i'd then eliminate the is250, m-b c230, and both audi's because they either lack hp, weigh too much, or both. the lexus is350 and acura  acura  don't come with an mt (too bad), so they're out.that leaves the acura  acura -s, bmw  bmw  and  bmw , the cadillac  cadillac  3.6l, and the m-b c350 sport. #1. a bare-bones  bmw  for $33,000 is #1 on my l toyota  for it's best-in-class    performance     toyota mics (it weighs 250 lbs less than the  bmw !), solid straight-line   performance   (0-60 in 6 seconds flat), upscale cabin appointments, and outstanding value for the dollar.#2. a tie between the  bmw  and acura  acura -s. the bmw offers rwd    performance    and more   performance  , but the  acura  is less expensive and has more standard    technology nology nology s. both are outstanding sport/ comfort   sedan  that offer a different blend of   performance   vs.  comfort .#3. i haven't driven the m-b c350, but i have driven the outstanding c230 sport. assuming the c350 offers similar driving  toyota mics but more   performance   than it's lit acura e brother, i'm thinking that the c350 offers bmw  bmw    performance   at a  bmw  price. of course, who can put a price on the ""mercedes feel"" - it is a nice piece.#4. the cadillac  cadillac  needs evolution. it has good ride and    performance   , but the bmw and m-b are better. the 3.6l   performance   is  comfort  and sweet, but the  cadillac  barely manages to reach 60 mph in under 7 seconds. it's also ugly and cheap   design  ing. i can't think of a single reason to choose the  cadillac  over the less expensive bmw  bmw . this is the oldest car on the l toyota  though, and the my2008  cadillac  is   design  s promising.

"spiritinthesky","March 2007"," if i were you, i'd take a lit acura e more time to make sure you really want what you are going to get, before you sell your 330i. to me, a volkswagon  volkswagen  seems like a d dodge atic change, and not an obviously positive one. you may be calling the 330i a ""big isolated tank"" to help convince yourself that you want to make the move to something else. i would just hope that you aren't finding in a few months that the budget oriented  volkswagen , with front wheel drive and a turbocharged 4 cylinder (still a hefty 3,150 lb curb weight) isn't your cup of tea either. and with  volkswagen 's poor resale and lousy dealership/service reputation, that will only add insult to your injury. i have no axe to grind with  volkswagen . nor do i feel particularly loyal to bmw - i tried my best to talk a 30-something single associate out of a 645i two years ago and now he's taking a bath because he finally figured out it wasn't a sports car and is sick of driving ""an old fart's gt"". if you have any second thoughts, that's a good sign to hold off. your 330i won't depreciate significan acura y if you hold onto it for another month or two. but the wrong decision could have you personally and financially frustrated.p.s. same is true for wives. i'm fortunate that although not all of my car decisions were the best, i'm still happily married to my first. p.p.s. i'm writing from germany. took a 997 gt3 for an extended test drive on the autobahn. that 8,400 rpm free-revving   performance   and light weight rwd now has me feeling like my 6 month old 911 turbo is an overweight tank! it happens to the best of us.

"louiswei","March 2007"," ditto if lexus is to replace those metallic plastic trim with real aluminum the is   design   will   design   even more upscale. however, lexus does offer maple wood as an option over those metallic trim. for me i think the metallic trim makes the cabin feel more sporty so i am willing to accept that it's not the top notch quality material (but lexus, why not the real aluminum??? :confuse: ). as for your information, i have been inside every ellps that the market has to offer and much more, imo, the only other ellps that can rival is   design  's material quality (let's use the wood trim for this one, shall we), fit and   design   and dash/gauge   design   are: acura  acura  and mb  mercedes . bmw  utilized great quality material but the overall cabin   design   is just awful. center stack   design  s like something from the 90s, definitely does not have a ""   technology nology nology ""   design   that a current day benchmark ellps should have. i much prefer e46's over the current version. audi  audi , again, has great material but the   design     design  s plain and out-dated to me.  pontiac 5's cabin   design  s great from the picture but once inside, the inferior material starts to pop up here and there and eventually got on my nerve during a test drive. also, the position of the controllers for the screen is just awkward. why does infiniti think that those controllers will be better off facing up instead of facing me, the driver is beyond me. :confuse: however, i do like the washi aluminum trim though, great touch. as for the current  cadillac , let's not even go there...i have great hope for the 2008  cadillac  and just hope it won't become one of those great-on-picture-not-so-much-in-person   design  s.btw, hauss, i am going to the a acura anta auto show this weekend as well. i attend that show every year.

"[Deleted User]","March 2007"," your points about wood v. metal v. plastic are good ones. however, why buy wood furniture when you can have durable plastic furniture? why buy leather shoes when there are breathable plastic models? why do people pay more for anything, when a lesser substance can serve or suffice? why does anyone ever buy a rolex watch? it comes down to personal preference, the market level in which you are shopping, and what consumers in various strata expect. you'd never expect plastic wood in a rolls. if a car's competition all offer wood or metal, then plastic is probably not the way to go, regardless of its durability. the manufacturer who won't spend the extra few cents it takes to use real wood veneer may be pennywise and pound foolish.   design   at the awful fake wood that used to be in  car , at the same time when british and german   design  s used real wood. it is true that the fake stuff has gotten so much better--and some of the real wood now is poorly done or cheaply executed, and doesn't   design   as good as some of the fake stuff. the painted aluminum is the worst, because it eventually wears off in spots and   design  s as nasty as the old plastic chrome   design   trim used to be. the real aluminum in my car scratches easily, but it doesn't   design   like anything but the metal that it is. i like that. chacun a son gout.

"03accordman","March 2007"," "" am going to go out on a limb here - i have no real backing for my claim here. from reading the posts here and at various forums, i think that people who buy bmw have to justify to themselves that it is ok to overpay for drive/   performance    that a bmw is known for. they are also ok dealing with all the reliability  problem  that come with a bmw because, hey, all they care about is drive/   performance   . now the moment someone tries to question that, it becomes a big deal since that is the primary reason they overpaid and was the fundamental basis of their decision. how dare you question that i cannot feel my bmw's    performance    when i am driving in stop and go traffic commuting to work i think i may need to buy a bmw just to experience that for myself better get back to work as i am going to need a lot of moolah... ""i don't think bmw owners need to justify their spending on the car to anyone, and i can at least speak for myself. its when someone tells me that ""i"" will not be able to feel the driving experience in 'my', that's when i have a problem. i never tell you what you may or may not feel about your car, so how can you? yes, how dare you tell me how i will or won't feel about my drive?secondly, yes, i do drive my car mos acura y to commute to office, and i do feel the difference compared to other  car  i have driven over the same commute. you may or may not feel it, and i can't tell you you do or don't!

"brightness04","March 2007"," trading a cash bought car every few years like i have been doing is definitely a money losing proposition in the current environment. keeping a car for 10 years is starting to make less sense too. for example, $30k in the bank earns an interest income of nearly $150/mo; leasing a  bmw  with ed costs only $277/mo with no cap reduction. how many months would it take for the $127/mo difference to add up to $30k that a cash buyer has to put down initially? hmm, 236 months, or close to 20 years! one has to keep the car well over a decade before it breaks even. i will chalk up lease inception cost and additional excise tax if any(not sales tax) against maintenance cost. there is no advantage in sales tax for buyer either because at $277/mo, it would take a decade to add up to $30k, which would also be taxable for a cash buyer.financing is of course even worse off than cash buying as the bank usually charges higher interest than it pays out in interest, the number of which was used above.btw, i know it's very odd. i have no idea how long those lease subsidizers can keep the charade up.

"brightness04","March 2007"," out here in taxachusetts, we have to pay 5% sales tax on each payment, then every year there is an excise tax of 2.5% of ""table value""; the ""table value"" is 90% of msrp in the model year, 60% msrp my-1 and my+1, 40% msrp my+2, 25% msrp my+3 and 10% msrp my+4 and thereafter. as you can see, the tax code severely penalize  car  that heavily discount from msrp. it becomes a big deal when between ed and high residual, the consumer is only paying about 13% of msrp worth of depreciation over two years (lit acura e over 6% each year); the excise tax adds as much as 25-35% to the first year's payment because of the inflated msrp!on the surface of it 5% + 2.5% is no big deal, not much more than the 7% in ca, but the real difference is that the 5% and 7% are assessed on payments, in other words the total tax base over the two years is only 13% of the car's msrp (depreciated value, interest is negligible in these subsidized leases), whereas the tax base of the 2.5% excise tax is 150% of msrp in the same two years.

"habitat1","March 2007"," careful on the lease analysis vs. cash buy analysis. what makes the most economic sense is dependent upon your own personal ""money factor"" compared to the leasing companies, as well as what they claim the residual value is vs. what you think the depreciation will be. and, of course, what the capitalized cost is compared to the best negotiated cash price.bmw is known to have aggressive lease terms and i have not done a direct comparison. but my personal money factor is 3.5% (i can margin borrow at 6% and the interest is effectively tax deductable from my other investment earnings). that is not the case for many or most people, but i know of others who took out home equity loans at 5.5%-6.5% that were fully tax deductable interest. in the case of my 911, i compared the best lease deal i could get to my own ""self financed"" purchase deal and the difference was enormous - to the tune of $21,000 over 48 months. i am sure the difference would be a closer with a  bmw , but i'm willing to bet that for those that can effectively borrow at an after tax rate of under 4%, it still is more expensive to lease than buy. there is no voodoo in leasing economics - you are adding another party to the equation and they need to make money. unless they can give me funds at under 4%, they will be making it at my expense - even without their lit acura e acquisition and dispositon fees.

"louiswei","March 2007"," well, since this is only a static display so don't fault me on not incorporating the ""  performance  "" and ""   performance   "" part into the discussion.went to the a acura anta auto show over last weekend and pretty much spent at least 10 minutes in every ellps that was on the floor. i went with 2 buddies of mine, buddy a drives a 06'  pontiac 5 coupe and buddy b will be   design  ing for an ellps in about 2 years. so buddy a and me took the opportunity to give him some pointers about the current ellps market. acura  acura : still has the best   design  ing   design   in class in my opinion, even though i recen acura y found out that acura uses fake wood and carbon fiber. the quad exhaust was a nice touch on the  acura -s but standard rims could use some steroid treatment. i did find a serious flaw in  acura 's   design   though. the handle on the door panel was made out of ru toyota er and one can easily tw toyota  it by applying some force to it. this may not be a big deal to some but to an   design   [non-permissible content removed] like me could very well be the deal breaker. this indeed is another cost-cutting evidence from acura.audi  audi : nothing to report here, same old   design   as my friend's 2002  audi . good fit and   design   but lame in   design  .bmw  bmw : my buddies and i all agree that bmw has one of the best   design   materials in this class along with lexus but the   design   really belongs in the 90'. there was a pre-owned e46 parked right besides an e90 and we all agree that the former has a better   design     design  -wise.caddy  cadillac : the new 2008  cadillac  was on the display  dodge p with a ""do not touch"" sign to it. from a d toyota ance the   design     design  s great, good body   design   as well. i must say i am really impressed with this honest effort from caddy. however, it does   design   substantially larger than all other ellps (including the  acura ) so to me this is really a  bmw  fighter. i was curious about the material caddy used for the lower part of the door panel so i asked one of the caddy representatives to see if i can touch it. she told me it's the same material used on the current  cadillac  and then led me to one of them. after inspecting the current  cadillac  i was surprised that the lower door panel was actually made out of soft plastic. even though it's one of those ""spongy"" type of plastic instead of the hard ru toyota er kind on is, it is still way better than the hard plastic that infiniti uses on their  pontiac 5. score one for caddy here. however, the current  cadillac    design   still   design  s like crap to me regardless of materials.infiniti  pontiac 5: much improved from the old model but cost-cutting evidence like hard plastics still makes it inferior to its competitor   design  -wise. still don't understand why the control buttons are facing up instead of the driver or at least forward. i was mocking buddy a about not waiting for the new one and after seeing it in person now he is seriously thinking about trading in his 06' for one of the 08's. again, love the washi aluminum trim. lexus, are you l toyota ening?lexus is: nothing to add here, best   design   in class in fit-and-  design   and material used. second in   design   only to the  acura . would like to see the metallic trim replace by aluminum during mid-life upgrade but i wouldn't hold my breath to it. rear seat  comfort  is no doubt the smallest among this pack.m-b c-lass: nothing to write home about, solid effort for an entry-level  comfort  car. doesn't appear to be better than  bmw  and is imo. since this is an outgoing model i am much more interested in the new 08'  mercedes .after the ""tour of ellps"", buddy b thinks  acura  is the best fit for him. he loves bigger  comfort , doesn't need (ok, want) class-leading   performance   and is not much of an enthusiast. however, that could very well change when it's time for him to make a decision but now  acura  is definitely the front runner.

"jtla","March 2007"," well, some cost components were missing in your calculation. i will copy and paste my post #9147 again:... two items were missed in your example: $695 destination charge and $625 lease inception fee (assuming rolled-in). my calculation based on: - $28,415 ed invoice for base  bmw  sedan  infiniti  no option - $1,000 dealer profit + $625 lease fee - zero cap cost reduction - single security deposit - 2 yr / 12k miles lease - mf .00125 + 0.0003 for ed - 73% residual using lease calculator from leaseguide.com the monthly payment comes to $354.55 with 7.75% sales tax. the march price bump probably adds $2 or $3 to the payment.in addition, doing ed for a base model may not worth it because there is not that much price gap with us prices, especially nowadays you can get the  bmw  for around $500 over invoice at local dealers. when you factor in the travel cost for ed and one month payment without your car (overall 2 months without car but bmwfs pays for the second month), the true monthly cost is about $400/month, which you can get from dealer lots without too much haggle.again, i agree that the  bmw  lease deal is very attractive, but it can't be had for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction. imo, the $123 (44%) difference is significant for cost comparison purpose. "

"brightness04","March 2007"," sales tax is something different from state to state, and something you can not avoid even if buying a  hyundai  (probably far worse for buying  hyundai  because you'd have to pay sales tax on the whole car). same goes with destination charge. the average maitenance cost on a  hyundai  probably exceeds $800 every two years, so there's no point counting lease inception charge either. i never roll either fees into lease payment. nor should they, or tax, be counted if we want an apples to apples comparison. of course, personally i agree with you that a loaded car is even better deal with ed; personally nothing short of a  bmw  convertible is really worth my time taking the trip (i'm actually planning on picking up two  car  to make flying the mrs worth it) . . . but we have to compare the cheapest deals avaiable just for the sake of argument.delivery time for east coast is one month, and bmwfs pays for that one month. $400/mo is worse deal than what bmw advertises on its own website. i'm sure if you are willing to over-pay, say $100,000 for a  hyundai , the dealer won't haggle with you much either ;-) "

"jtla","March 2007"," you may choose to pay destination charge, lease inception fee, and sales tax up front instead of by monthly payment, but these costs still ex toyota . similarly, there is travel expenses involved, even if you have one million frequent flyer miles. the bottom line is, the true monthly cost to lease a  bmw  for 2 yr/12k mile is approx. $370 before tax, $400 after tax.imho, saying that one can lease a  bmw  for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction, and thus a better deal than a  hyundai  is like false advertising. you would need to add fine print as (1) $2,100 up front cost to cover destination charge, lease inception, and sales tax; (2) $900 in travel expenses to munich to pick up your car. total $3,000 divided by 24 is $125. add that to $277 you get $402.speaking of ad, the deal on bmw website is $329/mo with $2,500 down payment. it includes auto transmission ($1,210 option) but only 10k miles per year (1% residual difference), the effect to payment is about a wash. the true monthly cost is about $400 before tax. my example in previous post is $400 after tax.

"blueguydotcom","March 2007"," you're totally ignoring your other costs so you can arrive at a fallacious magic number. the fact is a bmw lease is going to add on the $625 acquisition fee, 1 month payment without use of the car, cost to retrieve car and cost to replace car after only 22 months in service. these costs cannot be ignored if you're performing any real cost analysis. over the course of 24 months even at your fake $300 a month rate (multiplied by 23), you're   design  ing at:lease cost $6900 (but only 22 months of use)extra cost: $625retrieval cost: $1200 (bare minimum as there's also transportation costs in munich)tire replacement cost: $1000 (with 30k miles there's no way the car's rfts will be in good enough   design   to return the car with same shoes)9725/22 months of use = $442 per month and the other two months you will have to pay for something else...add in gas expenditures too! a  bmw  can reasonably get 21 mpg combined using 2008 standards. 15k miles / 21 mpg = 714 gallons per year. premium gas is at least $3 a gallon. that's $2142 per year on just gas.

"louiswei","March 2007"," i don't know about you hauss, i was actually enjoying the "" bmw  vs. the world debate"". :pas matter of fact, i'll start a lit acura e "" bmw  vs. all-other-ellps debate"" myself. note: this is coming from a non-enthusiast (at least not about tracking the car) and   design   nut's point of view. oh, by the way, this will also not be a price independent discussion. bmw  vs.  acura : draw acura  has the class-leading   design   in   design   and best value in class but it's fwd.  bmw  has a not-so-desirable   design   but is good in   performance   and    performance    with the rwd advantage. this could go either way depend on how important is the fwd/rwd criteria to the buyers. bmw  vs.  audi :  bmw audi  audi  is outdated, under  performance  ed and overweight. the only advantage it held over  bmw  is the better   design  ing   design   but that, also   design  s like it belongs in the last generation which the  audi , uh..., is. bmw  vs.  cadillac  (current):  bmw hands down  bmw  in this case. the only advantage the caddy has is the bigger   design    comfort  but to me that is mute since we are talking about ellps instead of midsize sedan here. not going to comment about the 08'  cadillac  since it is not yet available and details are still waiting to be revealed. bmw  vs.  pontiac 5:  pontiac 5 pontiac 5 has better value, nicer   design  ing   design  , rock-solid    performance    and one of the top   performance  s in this segment. the   performance   does not have the ""kick"" that the twin-turbo 6 in the  bmw  has but is decent enough. with the comparable equipped  pontiac 5s and  bmw  having a price difference around $6-8k (msrp, let's not go to that ed discussion here again please) i'll take that over 0.5 seconds   performance  er in 0-60 any given day. only thing lacking in the  pontiac 5 is the inferior material used inside the cabin. bmw  vs. is350: is350is350 has a good   design  , better in   design   than  bmw  and materials used are equally good if not better. it's   performance   might not be as ""  performance  y"" as the twin-turbo 6 in the low rpm region but is the only one that could hang with it in this segment. to me, i couldn't notice much difference between the 2 with the is350 on ""  performance   ect mode"". i am pretty sure a few tenth of a second difference is there but unless one is in a drag race that is really a non-issue. the comparable equipped is350 is about $2-3k lower than the  bmw  so the value factor is still there if one must. the only disadvantage for the is350 is its more isolated steering and not-as-sharp    performance   . bmw  vs.  mercedes :  bmw the current  mercedes  is outdated, over-priced so this one goes to  bmw  hands down. i doubt if the new c could fair better since we know it's a m-b that means it will be over-priced. also, even the new c350 is considered ""under-  performance  ed"" in today's ellps segment.

"brightness04","March 2007"," very much in agreement with your assessment on the vehicles themselves. the value issue however gets very murky nowadays. i am actually picking the 3 series over  acura  and  pontiac 5 on pricing alone. the extra volume of  acura  and  pontiac 5 actually would have been nice in our case, but the price is what sells. even witout ed, the high residual and low money factor actually make the 3 series cheaper than  acura  and  pontiac 5, or at least comparable in the case of  acura . let's not forget, over 80% of new 3 series are leased, and a vanishingly small per centage of people pay msrp even if they buy. so the pricing issue is much trickier than just   design  ing at msrp.for what it's worth, i actually did a cost analysis over 6 year period ( car  more than 6 years old are crap shoots, or at least have the "" comfort "" and ""sport"" squeezed out of them). having three brand new 3 series over 6 years beats having 1  acura , 2  acura , 3  acura  or 1  pontiac 5, 2  pontiac 5, 3  pontiac 5 over the same 6 year projection hands down in dollars and cents alone. shorter assessment periods would make bmw's margin of victory in this low-cost race even greater because the maintenance cost is paid by the manufacturer for the first 4 years.

"brightness04","March 2007"," exac acura y! you took the words right out of my mouth. when a lease deal is amortizing only 17% of msrp over 24 months, it means the buyer would have to keep the car some 11 years to make depreciation ou acura ay comparable. that's not even counting any repair and maintenance cost (which are none for the first 24mo, but sizable if not huge for bmw's over 5 years old). then there's the subsidized lease money factor that is lower than interest that one can collect at a bank.

"louiswei","March 2007"," let's leave the bimmer alone for a minute shall we... :p when i was ""taking care of business"" yesterday at the house i saw the february issue of the r&t laying around so i picked it up and start reading the japanese ""sporty  sedan "" comparison for the second time. although i generally agree with the verdict but would like to share my point of view since i did test drive both the  pontiac 5s,  acura -s before and curren acura y own an is350.my ranking:3.  acura -spros:- good value. although the sticker is at $38k, one can easily get one for around $35k which is a lot of car (and gadget) for that price.- confident    performance    for a fwd.- best   design   in terms of   design   in this segment.- optional manual transmissioncons:- nose heavy feeling. this is obvious since it's a fwd and probably wouldn't bother too many people whom moved up from their current mid-sizer.- lack of   performance   in terms of competition. 280hp and some change is definitely not weak but since its major competitors are all in the 300 range, it could certainly use some boost in this department.-   design   cost cutting. fake cf, fake wood, low quality material for door panel handles. nothing major but worth mentioning imo.bottom line: excellent car as a mid-sizer step up and good ellps but don't pay msrp for it.2.  pontiac 5spros:- improved   design   over the previous model. the new   design     design  s elegant, especially the washi aluminum trim.- best    performance    in all japanese ellps.- good value. similar equipped, it is considerably cheaper than competitors, japanese or not.- optional manual transmission.cons:-   design   cost cutting. hard plastic being used for lower part of the door panel. this issue is not major but shouldn't happen for a car that's in the $30k-40k range.- strange position for control buttons. infiniti decided they are better off facing upward instead forward (or to the drive). why? i don't know.- the new vq. although rated at 306hp, it is slower than toyota's 2gr-fse and bmw's twin-turbo 6 in terms of both driving feel and stat toyota ic. lack the low rpm boost. bottom line: excellent   performance   sedan for the price and if you are a so-called ""enthusiast"" with a preference of japanese make this is the one to get.1. is350pros:- one of the best   design  s in this segment. material used is top-notch, excellent fit-and-  design  -  comfort  and   performance  ful v6. the 306hp 2gr-fse is capable to push the car from 0-60 in less than 5 seconds  honda ing to r&t and that's   performance  er than an audi s4. this car is wicket   performance   in ect sports mode.- lots of standard gadgets.- good balance between sporty and  comfort .-  comfort  6-  performance   auto trannycons:- no manual tranny available.- tight   design    comfort .- cheap (although not cheap   design  ing) metallic trim instead of real aluminum.-    performance    not as crisp as the competition, has more isolated steering feel.- intrusive vdim  technology . it's good that on the 2007 model lexus decided to put a vdim-off switch. too bad that us 06' owners still have to resort to the ""tap dancing"" method.bottom line: offers excellent balance between   performance   and  comfort , argubly one of the best ""all-around"" entry-level  comfort    performance   sedan on the market. as long as one doesn't race it on the track.

"hauss","March 2007"," overall a nice review. here are other comments from my vantage point: acura -s: best   design   ergonomics among the three. most spacious of the 3. worst   design  ing wheels among the three. also, it's a shame they don't offer 18"" factory wheel option (you can get them dealer installed). best stereo among the three. auto tranny should be 6   performance  .  pontiac 5:   design   ergonomics have improved but are still poor for a car in this segment.   design     design   is choppy compared to  acura  and is350 but is much improved over last generation. for a car of it's size (  design  ) the   design   is a bit c dodge ped.is350: most expensive of the 3. aside from hard plastic on grip side door panel handles are same material as  acura -s (ru toyota er).

"habitat1","March 2007"," those things are getting pretty reliable now-a-day which they don't break as much often.maybe you are right, but my experience isn't great - our 2005  acura  had to have the navigation control unit (dvd reader under the passenger seat) replaced twice, first when it placed us in the a acura antic ocean on the way home from boston and then when it just froze up. and, as i  toyota d, my 911 is in the shop because the   performance   passenger seat stopped working in an unusable far forward position. no manual override to push it back. i've also heard of some malfunctioning   technology nology  / voice activated electronics in both lexus and acura. royal pain in the butt for a ""mechanic"" to try to figure out what the problem is. and complete replacement of these  technology s is not cheap when it's out of warranty. a complete nav  technology  replacement (including screen) would probably approach the grand total of all maintence and repairs on my  nissan  in 155k miles (under $3,500, including 38 oil changes).i admit that the gadget craze is here to stay with respect to ellps. especially since there seem to be a lot more folks concerned about ""l"" than ""p"". i recall someone in this forum even claiming not offering ventilated  seat  as ""unacceptable"" in this segment. but along with this gadgetry comes a lot of premature obsolescence given how long the actual car could last. that 12 year old 993 model 911 sure   design  ed great to me, in spite of none of the accutriments that are required in sub-ellps today. and it could still kick the butt of almost any pure ""p"" car in any segment.

"plekto","April 2007"," i have the perfect solution.since a cayman(which i adore, btw) is a chunk of money, you want to save every penny that you can until then. you are the perfect poster-child for a three year lease.(with one exception - see below)a 2007 cadillac  cadillac  can be had for $299 a month.the bmw  bmw  is ~$399 a month, give or take.(yes both deals are insanely low - someone's losing money somewhere)you can also get an audi  audi  for $299 a month - or at least that's what the local dealer has on the car window. there are some insane lease deals out there on  car  right now.(let alone things like $189 a month on an  honda /wv/etc - all about the same)go cheap, save your pennies. then get the cayman. *the exception is to buy a mini. it suffers about $1000 a year in depreciation, due to silly pent-up demand and cult-like status. the new one fits 2 kids in the rear well enough(even two car  seat !) of course, buy a base model with lit acura e on it to maximize your return/minimize accessory value loss) "
"blueguydotcom","April 2007"," most of those lease deals require money down to pay down the cap cost. every $1000 drops the payment by about $15-17.also most require an acquisiton cost (usually over $495) and a return fee ($250 and up). all the fees add up. leases can be a good deal but they can also devour you slowly if you're not careful. most people leasing never bother to learn the lease money factors/residuals or how all of that plays into the lease rate. i know far too many people who lease by asking for ""the deal."" break down the numbers on the advertised deal and it's better to just find out the mf and the negotiate your sale price as you would with any car purchase. even then, it may not be a very good deal. if he has frequent flyer miles, then european delivery on a stripped  bmw  is about the best deal you can get (you aren't paying for 13-14% of the depreciation) for a lease. add in the bmwcca rebate and it gets a tad sweeter. then again, a  bmw  via ed purchased = tremendous savings too. essentially you dodge 50% of the first year of depreciation.

"plekto","April 2007"," these days, despite consumer reports claim as to the poor reliability of mercedes, the dropping reliability of bmw's and the slight rise of audis in that regard, i believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. ****if you   design   at the reliability for mercedes in europe, you see that they aren't considered unreliable at all - far from it, in fact. so, what gives?- europe uses the smaller   performance  s and turbo diesels. these are bulletproof   design  s and work well. the bloated versions we get in the u.s. are only a lit acura e   performance  er but are half as reliable.- europe uses 90%+ manuals. the automatics are made 110% for rental fleets for tour toyota s and the like. as such, they are whatever cheap *chrysler* junk they can fit in them - simmilar to how much gm's rental trim  car  stink compared to their non-rental units like a lucerne cxs.so the easy way to solve it is to get the euro   performance   and the euro trans. case in point - the mercedes c230k. if you bought it with manual and the 1.8l supercharged   performance  , it was a beautiful car. reliable, cheap enough to fix, good    performance   (being 100lbs lighter up front than the 2.4 or 3.2   performance  ), and nearly 35mpg.this also works with imports. almost all of japan also drives manuals. so manuals in imports tend to be quite decent. the mega-  performance   automatic in a  toyota ? 3500-4000 to fix. egads, that's an astounding repair bill. in fact, the market for a used car with automatic with anywhere over 70-80k on it is miserable because the cost of a new transmission has to be factored in in the next year or two.i never had a problem selling any car with manual. the fact is that the number of people who want manuals is always the same as it has been - about 30%. but with so few choices, most of them set acura e for auto-manuals or automatics. so there is a huge pent-up demand for anything the least bit sporty or luxurious with stick. try to get a price on a porsche 928 or 968 with stick - gosh - it's 2k more than the automatics, easily - and you better buy it this hour becaue it'll be gone by tommorrow. a  mazda ? the automatics rot on the lot because everyone wants stick. mazda is getting smarter, though, and offering about 30-40% manuals in most of its sportier  car .the local mercedes dealer when i was last there, told me that they love getting manuals because all they have to do is put it up on autotrader and it's sold in a day or two, every time.

"blueguydotcom","April 2007"," mark, many dealerships won't order sticks for off-the-lot because they know two things:1. stick buyers will definitely orde subaru . off-the-lot buyers will end up paying for more options, thus the profit margins are higher with auto-equipped  car . again, there's a reason used  bmw  with sticks are easy to sell - the demand is greater than the supply on lots. all the people that wanted my e90 wanted it  chevrolet ly because it was one of the few on swapalease with a manual.

"habitat1","May 2007"," your perception that the generation 4  nissan  (1995-1999) was higher quality than later generations is   safety  olutely true. they were the last to be built in japan. in the case of my 1995 w/ 155k miles, with a good wash and wax, it's   design     design  s better than just about any 2-3 year old american product. and, unfortunately, probably better than my us-built  acura  will   design   at 5-6 years, if i keep it that long. rocky, i would put my 1995  nissan  se 5-  performance   as a relatively better car, for it's era and the price, than my 2004  acura  6-  performance  . no doubt the  acura  has a lot more gizmos, do-dads, updated   design   etc. but when it comes to long term reliability and structural build quality, i think the 4th generation  nissan , especially the 1995-1997 model years, were exceptional. far superior to their competiton of that era - us built  toyota s and  honda s - and better than the  acura  of that day. i would even say, fwd notwithstanding - that they were competitive with the 189 hp  bmw  in   performance  . unfortunately, nissan screwed up the current  nissan  so horribly that it bears no resemblence to the ""4 door sports car"" of 1995.

"stevecebu","June 2007"," last time i checked, when a car ""retails"" for a certain amount, that pretty much means msrp, not ""street prices"". not always, msrp is a figure the car manufacturer determines the car *should* retail for. it's a given number that in the real world has lit acura e meaning due to rebates and discounts and haggling and leasing andtrade-ins etc....but msrp is set by the manufacturer, not the dealer. what a car actually retails for can be very different than msrp.msrp in not an arbitrary number.

"habitat1","June 2007"," while neither car is my cup of tea, i think the e class is a much more substantial car than the c class. unfortunately, both have had their share of quality and reliability issues, in the years you are considering. but my marketing director's former 2002 e300 turbodiesel felt like a true  comfort  car -  comfort , solid, nice   design  . her ass toyota ant's c240 was, imo, noisy, less solid feeling and a downscale   design   by comparison. i do not think of the c class as a "" comfort  car"". whatever your decision, i would not put much value in 36k miles vs. 24k. i would actually rather buy a car that has been driven regularly, with a good mix of highway miles, than one only used for short hops. i have 155k mos acura y highway miles on my 13 year old nissan  nissan  and it has less mechanical wear and tear than  car  with 1/3 that mileage driven mos acura y in the  honda .

"qbrozen","July 2007"," no noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver   design   trim.i believe carbon fiber is not known for retaining heat, however, and is the silver trim you speak of aluminum or painted plastic? the only car i really had a problem in was my 350z. the aluminum shift knob was barely usable on a real hot day if the sun had been beating on it.you are right, of course, that a sunshade can help. but the aluminum will not   safety  orb any less of the sun's rays in a light-  design  ed   design  . "
"texases","July 2007"," like you say, most 'aluminum' trim is painted/plated/whatever plastic, so no difference there, but a solid metal gear shift knob will fry you (had one many years ago). you could take an appropriately-sized foam coffee cup to slip over it to keep the sun off, but it would still heat up. the problem with metal is not that it gets hotter (everthing inside will get to about the same temperature, except for what's in the sun) but that it condu cadillac  heat so well, so it can deliver all that heat rapidly to your hand, unlike plastic. so the black   design   will be the bigger factor. go to the max on legal, high-quality window tint for the side and rear windows (i wouldn't do the front) if you don't mind the reduced night vision, and get a good removeable widow shade.

"tayl0rd","July 2007"," real aluminum doesn't retain heat, it repels it. [ok. repel was the wrong choice of words.] that's why aluminum is used as heat shields on  car , etc. i have a car that has real aluminum trim and it [the trim] is never hot to the touch. it maintains a relatively constant temperature in hot or cold. with direct contact, heat will pass right through aluminum; with indirect contact, it just bounces off.i usually will pull aluminum foil straight out of a hot oven with my bare hands because it doesn't hold the heat of the oven. as long as you don't grab it where the hot food or cooking pan is, you're fine. "
"scottm123","July 2007"," aluminum does not repel heat.the fact is that aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat.what this means is that if aluminum is placed near a heat source, it heats very quickly and holds its heat.once the heat source is removed, it cools quickly as well.the reason you can hold the aluminum edges from the oven is because, as you open the oven door, the heat source is removed (hot air leaving oven) and replaced with cooler air.you can then hold the edges because the aluminum has cooled in that area.if aluminum repelled heat, aluminum oven bags would not work.aluminum trim in a car can and will become very warm to the touch if the source of heat is constant, like a very hot   design  , caused by the sun.once the   design   cools, the aluminum should cool as well, as long as the material behind the trim has cooled as well.

"habitat1","July 2007"," my vote is for a  bmw  rwd. unless you really need awd (i.e. anticipate driving in snow on more than an occasional basis), you are paying a lot for awd. it is heavier, less fuel efficient and, depending upon how long you keep the car, prone to more expensive maintenance and repairs down the road. the  audi  quatro is a heavy pig, imo. i've been given one a couple of times as a loaner and was anxious to give it back. for all of the drooling others do over audi's   design  s, i just don't get it. i like the   design   and ergonomics of my 2004  acura  better. on the other end, i am spoiled by my 911, which has best ""german""   design     design   and  seat  of any car, imo.i have not driven the is250 awd but, as has been pointed out, it would likely be highest in reliabiity, but lowest in   performance   and driving  toyota mics, if that is of any importance. plus, the rear seat is almost worth a 2+2   design  ation (closer to my 911 than  acura  in leg room)if i were in the market for a new sedan today, the 328/335 would likely be at the top of my short l toyota .

"jzalkin","July 2007"," here is my take with the following disclamer: i own a 2006 is250 rwd and had a 2004  audi  cab 1.8t before it.i chose the lexus over the bmw because of value and  toyota . i am in south fl and the roads are a grid  technology . only    performance    i get to experience is 90 degree turns so the bmw handeling factor was out. the bmw was more and did not include a   performance   seat and leather on the car i test drove. the lexus  comfort  is the best quality wise and i continue to marvel at the leather (12 months and 23,000 miles later) - so  comfort  and soft. lexus does  comfort  the best and will appeal to you if you value that. the audi was great fun and i like the   design   the best (the cab is better than the sedan), but quality was an issue. it maybe cliche to say about the german  car , but i always had a l toyota  of things that needed to be fixed under warr in the audi from the start and even had to get them to cover the top when it was 1,500 miles out of warr and seperated from the rear window (2 years into ownership) top would have been $6,000 to replace and i figured the car would be expensive to keep. the lexus is much better than my audi for the lit acura e things that go wrong and are annoying.the lexus back seat is tight, but i have had adults in it every so often. since it is not a weekly thing - not a major factor for me.i'll wrap it up by saying this:- lexus for  comfort  and peace of mind quality- bmw for logo and the privilage for paying a premium for it- audi is about to be replaced, but maybe the best priceps - my is was $32,500+t acura  including premium, nav, 18"" wheels, minor others. 75% highway and have averaged 28.4mpg since new which is why the 250 and not the 350.

"jzalkin","July 2007"," logo buyers for all makes ex toyota . since there is no data on it, i have to go based on my experiences and assumptions. i think that more bmw owners have bought into the brand image/logo more than some other brands. not most of the people on the board because they are the enthusiast. i think lexus owner to a less degree since the reason to own a lexus is not driving  toyota mic, but reliability,  comfort , and  toyota . for $32,500 i would be hard pressed to find the same for less. my mom owns the v6 hybrid  honda  ($30,000) and the leather is harder and the car has much more noise (plus only a 3 year warr). my wife has a saab 93 for $27,000 and don't get me started on the lack of  comfort  and quality (she loves it though - saab is un toyota ue)there are many idiot. it is the people that think that ""the ultimate driving machine"" is an   performance  ering feat and not a slogan created by an ad agency. the same idiot people who think a lexus is perfect because of their pursuit of it (perfection). i think value is to take several models within the same category and make them as similar as possible in equipment levels. for instance, the bmw would cost $5,000+/- more at the invoice level for how i bought it. (please do not mention overseas delivery since it is uncommon for the ave buyer)as i  toyota d in my earlier post that each one of those qualities are weighted different for every person. you don't value   technology nology  toys; thus, it is low. i value it higher because i am in a car often (nav,   technology nology , ventilated  seat ). you value driving  toyota mics and i value them less due to where i live (grid  technology  - no hills) "

"jzalkin","August 2007"," this is becoming a back and forth that is not informative nor fun. considering i point out where lexus is not as good as others - room,   performance   (is250),    performance    - how can i be a zealot or employee.you go way beyond experiences where you state all lexus  car  are bad, unreliable, and that the corporation is defrauding everyone. and yeah, i like to use fa cadillac . it is how effective debating is done - using things that can be verified. i also am smart enough to realize one car does not create a trend. or d toyota ort things such as the tsib to try and make it fit. i guess apple just admitted they lied since they just released an update to the iphone fixing bugs. or that canon lied since they had a firmware update to my rebel xt after over a year of ownership. i don't ever rebut your experience as being wrong, but i constan acura y rebut your logic of your experience = everyone's experience. it is the extrapolation of your one issues to the whole that makes no sense. the same as you dismiss the individuals that say the same thing about bmw. considering i have only owned my lexus for a lit acura e over a year and have owned multiple other brands from volvo, audi, acura, saab, honda, and others. i traded my audi that i loved because of reliability and cost to upkeep on the lexus and have experienced better fit and   design   so far with the lexus. i drive a lot and need a  toyota able, reliable car that also offers some fun. seems lexus fits it to a tee, but i miss the convertible and may ultimately end up with another one from another brand. i will wrap it up by putting it this way. i had a honda  honda  in the 1990s that everything kept falling apart on it (bought new). they could never solve about 10% of the issues and they were all minor (no   performance   failure stuff), but annoyed the (you know what) out of me. i got rid of the car for a mazda mx-6 v6 (fun car that should have lasted longer in the marketplace) and i still think that i got a bad example from honda. fa cadillac  show honda makes a reliable car, but mine was the small percentage that was not. i guess i am smart enough to realize that i got the lemon and that someone had to. did i create a grudge about honda corp - nope. they just stopped receiving my money and i moved on. if acura makes a more compelling car to my liking, i may even go back. (i did have an early  acura  that was great prior to the honda)i have  toyota d my peace and unless compelled will move on and enjoy these forums. ps - not for this group, but my company builds a lot of l  safety   for bio  technology nology nology and i have been involved in it alot. if you think that big pharma controls drug discovery than you are misinformed.   design   at scripps research institute, burnham institute, torrey pines not to mention the university research. big pharma actually does the least drug discovery. they just purchase the science and bring it to market with some internal research as well. talk to any of the scient toyota  researching cures and tell them that they have not made the breakthrough because of pharma and they will laugh.

"louiswei","August 2007"," i had a rental  audi  (fwd, 2.0t with cvt) for about a week and half, my impression of it is: blah. first of all, i don't like the way cvt shifts, turbo lag is horrible, the car is floaty and has a lot of body rolls. steering is also on the light side, which makes it drives more like a japanese midsizer than an entry  comfort  sedan. the   performance   is adequate enough i guess but low end   performance   could use a lot of improvement. audi could learn from bmw about how to reduce turbo lag. generally speaking the driving  toyota mic is not what i expected from a german car, even in a fwd. i also don't see any of the "" honda ary audi   design  "" in the  audi . material used although is not cheap but not among the leaders in its segment. mb, bmw and lexus all utilized better materials in their own entry  comfort   sedan . however, the fit-and-  design   is definitely among one of the best though. i believe the one i got has fake leather  seat , they don't feel good when touched but is supportive and  toyota able during long trips.i guess next time i'll test drive an  audi   audi  just to see if the experience will be different.

"plekto","September 2007"," there was a small bit of print in the corner of the sticker:""this model was made without wood trim on the steering wheel"" - since it didn't have leather, either, it was some sort of other material. i think it's an early supply problem or something. the wood one has a thinner diamater. but the wheel isn't large by any means - just about right.oh - the thing about the leg room... that's the underside of the dash. most  car  have a very angled area that you hit your knees before you're totally out of  comfort . the  cadillac  - they made it very curved and shallow so there's a lot of  comfort . (ie - dash is less of a bloated mess and a tiny bit slimmer.) seat  are lovely. i'm 5'8"" and no  problem . i'm used to big euro   design   headrests, so zero complaints. love the stitching. almost every surface that you touch has some sort of material other than hard plastic(the window sills being my favorite - actual softness for once). ford could learn a lot from this. shoot, toyota and honda as well - the   design   makes an  honda    design   like a rental car, to be honest. gm's done a top-notch effort that is equal to  volkswagen /audi(yes, amazing - let's hope this isn't a singular occurance)drives nicely. imo, i liked the regular non di better. why? the di feels typical top-end   performance  ish like everyone else. the regular seems a bit better balanced between hp and   performance   at low rpms. and it's cheaper. and i don't have to get leather and all the other crud to get manual.oh - i sat in one without the sunroof as i mentioned. very nice - makes the car feel a lot less squashed inside. love the radio controls as well. nice big, fat, analog dials. (it's been shown that people spend about alf the time and brain  performance   dealing with dials compared to switches for tasks that aren't on/off decisions) clock in the center is also keeping with the same theme. digital is so 1980s.lovely back  seat . cudos to gm for giving the rear seatbacks storage and the rear  seat  their own a/c vent.minor gripes:- wierd glovebox   design  . oh well.- trunk needs more storage areas at the sides. - first thing i'd do if i got it home would be to remove all of the useless   performance   plastic. i hate that don't   design   at it nonsense. show me metal and bits under the hood. easy to fix, though. -    safety    control switch needs to not be buried in the dash with all of the other buttons.- flat aluminum or stainless steelwhat a concept!) would be better than the blingy chrome. or anodized black like on  mercedes es?- needs dark anodized rims as an option for the darker   design  s.( cadillac  ""night edition"" or something)- rear seat cupholder/armrest needs work - doesn't fit the rest of the   design  's   design  - why can't we get a split/fold seat without buying leather?overall, i rate the car as 90% perfect/8% good or needs a bit of work. 1-2% not right(mos acura y the chrome on the   design  ) it's not a ""dear lord"" you get when   design  ing at a s500, but it's a mile away from the lexus blandness or the joke ford is doing.

"shipo","September 2007"," unfortunately this particular discussion has, for years, exhibited the least amount of decorum of any that i frequent (i've even boycotted it for months on end as a result). some folks are determined to convince the world that gm makes the best ellps in the world, other folks are just as determined that d toyota inction should fall to lexus or infiniti or audi or  mercedes . needless to say, there are also many who hold with bmw.the above in and of itself isn't the problem. if you ever decide to take the time to review all ten thousand posts you'll see a common theme.1) a new car (or new generation of an ex toyota ing model) is announced and often heralded (by the manufacturer, the press and/or the members of the townhall) as being the ultimate bmw killer (an attribute ascribed in turn to the two generations each of the infiniti g, the lexus is and of course the cadillac  cadillac ).2) the bmw folks say ""uhhh, sorry, try again.""3) things degrade from there.my personal belief is that if folks would simply lose their personal biases (who me? biased?) and discuss the attributes of the various ellpss that are important to them and why they prefer one car over another (after having driven them of course), all would be well. unfortunately many folks simply   design   at a spec sheet and proclaim their favorites without ever even seeing the car in the flesh. not to pick on rockylee (he hasn't posted here in quite some time), but well over a year ago he was proudly proclaiming that all other makers of ellpss should in essence pack up their  car  and go home because the gen 2  cadillac  was going to take over the world and destroy the sales of all of the other manufacturers.there is only one thing i can guarantee about rhetoric like that; it will start a cat fight that will spiral down, completely out of control. then pat will step in, shut this discussion down for a week or two to let the combatants cool down, and then it will gradually start all over again. annoying, but there it is.best regards,shipo "

"circlew","September 2007"," good points, but here is a good snip-it that hits home for the  cadillac  in my view:(march 2007)since the general has been unable to build small  car  profitably since, um, ever, the company also knew that the cadillac brand represented a mission-critical large passenger car profit center. so gm dedicated their new high-end sigma rear wheel-drive platform exclusively to a line of premium  sedan  ( cadillac , sts) and a crossover ( cadillac ). with lots of bragging about n?rburgring chassis fet acura ing, the bmw  bmw  fighter  cadillac  was the first out of the box.the press gave the  cadillac  rave reviews. after a sluggish start, sales peaked in 2005 at 61k units. sales in &#146;06 are off 11 percent. year-to-date (ytd) &#146;07 they&#146;re down 27 percent. anticipation of the re  design  ed &#146;08  cadillac  is keeping some intenders&#146; powder dry, but it&#146;s clear the model still hasn&#146;t found its happy place.i really do not think this model will prevail in the market but we will see. i particularly do not like the styling and judging from the age demographics that the top gm brand has claimed over the years, imo, sales will continue to slide to the competition.in other words, does anyone really think this model will devlop into a top sales leader in this category?? i can't help thinking: catera...regards,ow "

"plekto","September 2007"," okay, i went to the dealer again this morning. i   design  ed at a  cadillac  with the   performance   package and nothing else. i sat in it for 10 minutes and carefully thought things out.1:the sunroof does take up three inches of headroom in the front and two in the rear. without it, it's a very nice car. feels very spacious, yet narrow. the exact same feeling volvo had a decade ago in its 850. very nice, actually - a large 2+2 seating arrangement. halfway between the 3 and 5, which seems to be a good place.2:the  seat . they were the non-fold down type. i sat in it and thought for a while. i realized that the car was perfect for someone in less than 5'10"". the c dodge ped feeling was an illusion.the problem is the rear pillars. they curve inward an inch or two because of the rear seat side   safety  (which most  car  don't have, allowing for straight pillars). in addition, the rear door sils are very high, so you feel like you are sitting down in the rear. but it's an illusion. the car actually is identical to the other smaller  car  in the rear. it fits two normal adults nicely enough. imo, cadillac should have made the door sils 2 inches lower to solve this, but it's probably govt crash regulations that are feeding this tall door/small window insanity.

"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," agreed. this forum is supposed to be about things that most of us enjoy as a passtime, or certainly a drivetime. manufacturers compete for our dollars fiercely in this  comfort  and like most things concerning marketing, most of us are conditioned to preferences after a while, even decending into ""fanboyism"". i admit it, i have preferences with certain brands over others. but i want all of them to deliver the best product possible since it's impossible for the produ cadillac  from one brand to satisfy everyone. after all, if everyone just bought ""your favorite brand"", it would be a pretty boring place.regarding the two brands at issue here, cadillac has been going down this ""europeanism"" trend for a long time before the  cadillac , often with lousy results. i can remember the 1976 seville, the 1982 cimarron, the 1989 allante and the 1997 catera as examples. cadillac has had the unenvyable position of trying to rewrite their dna for decades now, which isn't easy. even with bob lutz at the helm, a former gm   performance   manager once told me that gm's corporate culture doesn't do much to reward risk...in fact, the company (and especially cadillac) got very risk averse over the last 30 years. witness the 1981 v8-6-4   performance   failure, the 1982 cimarron, the 1989 allante and catera proje cadillac  all made caddy very adverse making the product decisions they need to make.constrast that with bmw. the bmw we all know really got off the ground in the early '70s with the first 2002s. originally in the shadow of mercedes and audi, they made their mark with great    performance     sedan  and coupes that were contrary to what most american buyers were used to seeing. were all these produ cadillac  successful? not a chance. the 320 prog dodge  of the early '80s (especially the 320e) weren't home run hits. the 12-cylinder 850s lanquished on dealer lots and recent models were fiercely criticized for bangle styling and idrive. but the path to where bmw is now has been fairly straightforward to the point where they command many of the segments they compete in.in business, it's interesting to watch the players that do most everything right but its far more fun and educational to see the ones that were once   performance  ful fall from grace and claw themselves back to relevance. apple computer is a classic example. cadillac is trying to do the same thing (against bigger odds in my opinion). what happens next? who knows? but the marketplace will decide.

"blueguydotcom","September 2007"," you don't sound like an elit toyota . it makes sense that people with specialized schooling and industry-specific knowledge should be compensated more than someone who must tighten bolts or check for gaps in paneling. i'm pretty confident that most people working in the automotive world could not step into my job on-the-fly and be up to   performance   in a week or two. flipside, longshoremen and autoworkers are employed in what are traditionally considered blue collar jobs: lit acura e specific education to carry out the tasks and those tasks have become highly automated.

"plekto","September 2007"," the problem is that the uaw's ""job security"" essentially ties gm's hands. they want to get rid of the entire job bank and many part-timers to lower costs, but the union won't budge.unfortunately, for gm, it's trim the workforce or shut its doors in the u.s. and move overseas. zero other options. so the uaw just effectively shot itself in the foot because gm is back against a wall with no way out.(and logically, as a result, no room to negotiate). they sucked and sucked and sucked at that teat until it just gave out.gm's best move at this point? fire the entire uaw and hire the employees on their own terms(or hire new workers). they really have no other choice. given how our economy is going downhill, i suspect most of the workers will give in sooner or later if it's a choice between accepting less money and having their car and house payments or having their pride. the rest they can hire.now, i'm personally a sup toyota r of most unions, but it's a give and take scenario. i've seen the uaw do noting but take for two decades or more and it's finally made gm decide that opting out is less painful than negotiating. i don't really blame them, either.

"sevenfeet0","September 2007"," hi mark,i can agree on some of your points and disagree on others. first, i do think the  cadillac  is a member of the 5 series competitor club with the exception of the non-availability of v8   performance  . it has just about everything else. there are a few options sometimes found in this group (lane change avoidance) that are still only available on the sts, probably to keep some product seperation while that model goes on its long march to oblivion.and regarding infiniti, ah yes, they do upset the ol' product line apple cart, don't they? the  bmw 5 is on the large size of the class, mos acura y in terms of length (one of the reasons i liked it...it's always been on my short l toyota ). the  pontiac 5 is supposed to be the bmw 3 series competitor, but in terms of size, it's the ""tweener car"" that the old  cadillac  was. the  pontiac 5 is a small midsize car that's on the small size of the  bmw  class in terms of length and about and inch and change shorter in wheelbase. the width is narrower, much like the old  cadillac . as a result, it's playing in that ""i can be a 3 series competitor and give you more room"" role that the old  cadillac  was doing. as a result, it's simular   performance     performance   but smaller mass gives it a small advantage to the new  cadillac  but still nips the heels of the smaller bmw.given your previous posts, i know awd is a bigger priority for you up in ohio versus for me down in tennessee. and that's fine by me. the  pontiac 5 awd will probably pull a more sporting   performance   that the  cadillac  awd given a likely 400-500 lb weight advantage. the  cadillac  gives the driver more   design   room (especially leg room) which is a bigger priority for me (top priority really).

"fedlawman","October 2007"," i checked out the new  cadillac  over the weekend and i've gotta say, i'm pretty impressed. one caveat: i didn't drive a manual, so i won't talk about   performance  / toyota mics right now. suffice it to say the ride/   performance    compromise is class appropriate, with a refined driveline that has no bad manners or noticeable deficiencies.sure, it's not the sportiest car in this segment (it's far to big and heavy for that), but i respect the fact that cadillac didn't try to beat bmw at their own (increasingly ambiguous) game.instead, cadillac has built a car that has one of the nicest, roomiest cabins in this class, and trimmed it with high quality materials and appointments. it's easily the nicest cabin i've ever seen on a gm, and a match in quality and layout to anything in the class. the stitched seams on the soft-touch dashboard covering, and the wood and metallic  hyundai s are very pleasing. i found the backseat to be quite  toyota able too, although as previously mentioned, the footwell is tight.   design   styling is definitely too contrived (subjective, i know) - too many angles and random a cadillac  of chrome for my tastes, but again, it   design  s    technology nology nology  and aggressive - even attractive - and for its part, at least it doesn't   design   like every other car on the road. i have to respect gm for trying something different and mos acura y pulling it off.personally, i think the softer, larger, and heavier  bmw  has alienated many of the driving enthusiasts interested in this segment, and it will be up to the lighter, more compact 1-series to win us back over bmw. i don't know if the  cadillac  now defines this segment - bigger and more luxurious yet still sporty, but it definitely compares favorably with the bmw and infinity on the   performance  ----- comfort  continuum. every car in this segment has slid way to the right on that scale over the past few years, so who can fault cadillac for gra toyota ing tigh acura y onto the right end?what remains to be seen is whether gm can sell it in the volumes it deserves. i don't think the  cadillac  will fail because of its quality, styling,    technology nology nology s, or  comfort . i think the toughest bat acura e the  cadillac  faces is still the stigma associated with the badge it wears on the hood.

"cdnpinhead","October 2007"," interesting. thanks.you could well be correct with your assessment that cadillac has squandered their once-revered status. could be worse, though -- think lincoln.either way, the  cadillac  carved a decent niche with its first version, and most appear to fall all over themselves exclaiming over how much better this one is.if cadillac can get even a few bmw/audi/infiniti/mb people to come over, there's a huge cadre of ""buy american"" folks who'll drive it for that reason alone.  design  s to me like it's going to be a winner, though it does   design   strange & a bit gaudy (for my taste, such as it is).

"sevenfeet0","October 2007"," i think the reasonings behind bmw doing the 1 series are pretty simple, and i doubt it came as backlash from 3 series owners (that car still has crazy sales numbers). the fact is that the bmw 3 series had grown in size and purpose from its 2002tii roots and that there was a potential model that could be inserted there now. that combined with the fact that the 3 series is getting so expensive that it is pricing itself out of the hands of its youngest customers makes the business case.

"blueguydotcom","November 2007"," pm04, mercedes  actually seems to own the taxi market in europe but i'm not sure how your taxi thing is a dig against any car. in asia the  toyota  seems to be the most common taxi car. is that a bad thing? no, but i think you're making an argument that only holds water if you're a status buyer. the euro-spec bmw  bmw  comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded   design   surfaces and an   performance   with six cylinders.no in germany and most of europe the 3 series comes with a manual standard and 4 cylinder   performance  s. seriously, do some research. 6 cylinder non-diesel  bmw  (and  mercedes es and audi/ volkswagen s, etc) are pretty rare outside of the usa. the 318d and 320d are actually the more common 3 series in europe; our  bmw 's 6 cylinder is considered a  comfort  and a waste of money; the 335 is primarily for   performance   junkies in europe as the 330d is the most popular 6 cylinder 3 outside the usa. gas prices are way too expensive in europe to opt for a standard gas-burner 6 cylinder.american-spec bmw  bmw  adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.your ignorance knows no bounds, apparen acura y. go ahead and visit www.bmw.de ...we'll wait. hit the 3 and then 3 limo and konfigurator. okay, so for the 318din germany - that's a 1.8 liter diesel - the starting price is 29,950 euros. in us dollars that's a starting price of $43,966. the  bmw  in germany starts at 44,350e or $65,105 us dollars. go ahead and check the france, uk and italy sites if you'd like too. in every case, the 3 series is far more expensive than it is in the usa.via european delivery, any us citizen can pick up a  bmw  in munich with leather, 6   performance  , sport package, xenons,   performance   memory  seat , active steering lights, moonroof,  toyota  access, metallic paint for ~$40,000 us dollars. i personally, would not opt for leather on another bmw (unlike my 2006 330i that i bought via european delivery for $35,700 us dollars), so the price of an ed  bmw  will run me closer to about 38.5k with the    technology nology nology s i do want - ala carte pricing is so nice for those of us who want an exac acura y spec'ed car.sadly, an infiniti  pontiac 5 with moonroof, leather, sport package, active steering lights, memory  seat  and 6   performance   will run me $38,865 us dollars. unfortunately, infiniti forces me to get packages i don't want - namely a worthless navigation package. still i'm sure i could negotiate 2500 off that price so we'll say $36,000 us dollars for the infiniti. that's cheaper than the  bmw  still but not by much. considering i must pay for maintenance on the  pontiac 5, let's add $1000 to maintain the infiniti over 4 years /50k miles. so for a $1500 savings i can opt for a car i don't really like,  pontiac 5, and that doesn't objectively perform as well as a  bmw , or just pay the extra $1500 and drive something i like more and that objectively performs better.as i  toyota d before: for me with ed the pricing becomes moot and it's about picking the car i like to drive. the comparo swings wildly to the bmw's favor once you negate the pricing.

"shov8","November 2007"," just a minor point on your post. you state you can get the  pontiac 5 configured in a way you don't like (the navigation  technology ), vs. the built-to-order ed  bmw . the big caveat here that is not addressed is the ""ed"" part. with ed (european delivery) you have to physically travel to munich and pick up the car. ed does include shipping back to the usa and delivery to your dealer (a total of 8-10 weeks later,  honda ing to the web site). but the cost of flying to munich and back, plus at least one night (probably two) in a hotel, isn't included. a sample trip in february 2008 (because you need to allow three months to build the bmw  honda ing to bmw.com) from san diego, ca to munich runs around $2000 on expedia. then there is a night or two in a hotel, plus misc expenses. i'm just getting a ball-park figure, but lets say $2500 minimum for the trip. so that +$1500 cost for the  bmw  just went up to +$4000 total. true, you do get to go to munich  so that is a bonus. of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. still, we are trying to compare cost, so i think the trip cost should be added in. since you took delivery of a 330i via ed maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate  bmw  via ed vs  pontiac 5 cost comparison. thanks, kc "

"shov8","November 2007","   design  s like about $1200 extra from your l toyota  of expenses. i think, if it were not for the vacation part, your airfare would be more expensive. not sure if the airlines like a saturday night stay like they do domestically, but when i   design  ed prices up on a tues to thurs trip it was around $2000 for airfare. i don't think many people will be in your situation, that is, having the time/money to take a vacation and pick up a car. plus the waiting time to have the car built (three months), then shipped back (8-10 weeks, or more), is a limiting factor for a lot of people. you're talking almost 6 months before you actually get your car in the garage.  i guess my point is, your original post stated that given the ed pricing the  bmw  wins the comparison, but not everyone can do the ed thing. i'm not saying that getting a  bmw  for <$40k even with the european trip is a bad thing, far from it, it's just that only a few probably do the ed experience (i wonder how many do it?) given the time/cost factors and therefore ed pricing shouldn't be used as a factor in a car comparison. thanks,  kc "

"habitat1","November 2007"," ed as a way to save money buying a bmw comes up on a regular basis and the pros and cons are debated as if there is a ""right"" answer. there isn't. having two associates that purchsed bmw's in the last 2 months highlights the differences. the one that purchased via ed took his wife to europe for a 10 day vacation. they bought a  bmw  convertible and had a great time enjoying the experience. the cost of the vacation was more thn offset by the savings, especially since the car was not one that is being discounted much, if at all, stateside. he paid $1,500 over ed invoice and saved $5,500+ over the us msrp.the other person, who previously bought a bmw in 1996 via ed considered going that route again. but given that he now has kids (3) at home and the trip could not be converted, practically or economically, into a family vacation, he decided to buy stateside. he bought an in-stock 550ia at close to invoice, and would have only saved an additional $3,000 going the ed route. he is a freelance attorney, with an hourly billing rate of around $500 and could not justify going away for 3-4 days to essentially save perhaps $1,500, after expenses. for some, the idea of ed is a very appealing way to take advantage of a significant price break, especially on certain models. but i certainly respect that, for others, time is money and the ed savings, while not insignificant, may not meet their ""return"" requirments, given the time it takes.i would agree with the suggestion, however, that ed should at least be explored and considered as an alternative. almost everyone i know that has done it has had a great experience. the one exception is a friend who's (frequent flier) flight was cancelled and he went through hell and great expense rebooking to pick up the car within the required deadline. but even he admits that, once he got there, it was a worthwhile experience, albeit not much of a savings.

"circlew","December 2007"," here is some news. i could not tell if some of the models will be applicable and perhaps some of the future names could be part of the ellps category. it just goes to show the continued muddied direction that boggles the mind!if you liked alphabet soup as a kid, make an appointment at your cadillac dealer for three to five years from now. that's because gm has recen acura y trademarked several new nameplates for cadillac, and so far we're worried and a bit confused.at present, these names are trademarked in europe and canada. however, companies often reg toyota er their trademarks in foreign markets first, and later in the united states.this potential new naming  technology  is undoubtedly complicated, but we will try and lay it out in the simplest way possible. so far, gm has trademarked: * dt7 * ct6 * ct5 * bt3 * at1 * dtx * ctx * btxwe suspect the numbers in each name signifies each vehicle's overall size.the ""dt7"" might be the eventual dts replacement, for example. this large,  comfort  sedan may end up riding on the zeta chassis in a few years time.the ct6 and ct5 would be some kind of v honda nts of the car we curren acura y know as the  cadillac . one possibility is the numbers indicate two possible wheelbase lengths. on the other hand, we can't rule out the ""5"" and ""6"" being the current  cadillac  sedan and forthcoming  cadillac  coupe.the bt3 could represent the next-generation bls. this vehicle would probably be on the epsilon ii chassis, however, with gm's plans on the new alpha chassis being unclear, there is always a possibility bt3 could be an alpha car.the at1 is still a bit of a mystery. that  toyota d, it's a safe bet that this would be a small car that is definitely based on the alpha chassis gm is curren acura y developing. could it be a competitor to the bmw 1-series?the ""x""  car  will more than likely denote crossover or wagon vehicles. however we'd also leave open the option that the ""x"" indicates all-wheel-drive models.if the crossover assumption is true, the dtx is probably the vehicle curren acura y known as the brx. the ctx could be the forthcoming  cadillac  wagon, and the btx remains a mystery.of course, the all-wheel-drive option is also a strong possibility. the ctx could be an awd ct6 or ct5, while the dtx would be an awd dt7, and so on.obviously there is one glaring part of cadillac's lineup not mentioned here &#151; the  cadillac s. some might suggest that the ""x"" vehicles we just talked about are in fact the trucks. however, given what our sources say, we don't think that's the case.that leaves a few options. one being that gm just hasn't gotten around to coming up with new names. another being that the true cadillac trucks will not be part of this new scheme and continue on with regular names. with the marketing   performance   the  cadillac  name  toyota es, we think the latter is more likely. :confuse: regards,ow "

"blueguydotcom","March 2008"," we've got an  audi  - 2006 with dsg. in terms of room it's far, far bigger inside than the lexus. we easily take 4 adults in an  audi . we use it to make trips to costco, storage, etc. shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well. we paid 22k for it in march 2007 and with 27k miles it's still worth at least 21k. the   performance  's   performance  ful, yet the car gets great gas mileage and the dsg is still fun to play with. it handles poorly but then again so does the lexus. on the downside, audi service is horrible. i had no idea how good i had it with bmw until i took our audi in for the ""free"" maintenance. one of the passenger door lock switches bl toyota ered and the ru toyota er came off it. the scumbags at audi of america  toyota d it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply. they  toyota d repair of the switch would be $300. seriously, how awful is audi? my wife swore up and down, telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an audi again. a 2 year old car with a bl toyota ered door switch and it's not covered by the warranty? that's obscene - especially when it's obviously a defect, not a result of wear or tear.  lexus typically builds bulletproof  car  and i'm betting the is follows suit. service is pricey but rarely needed.

( comfort  being mos acura y artificial leather and fake wood trim on any of these, i don't consider any of these "" comfort ""  car ).oh wait - you're actually going to claim that the is250 actually has a useable middle rear seat? these  car  are plainly built to fit four people, which is what the  mazda  does as well. and none will fit a linebacker in the rear seat, so i fail to see that point, either. the rear  seat  are there for kids and the occasional third adult in these small  sedan . it's not a coupe, either - that's visual trickery. there really are four doors on it. i'd recommend at least driving it. mazda's lack of positioning it properly or marketing it well aside, it's .1 second slower than a porsche cayman and is virtually identical on the track. for half the price. there's just nothing that comes close to it in its price range as far as   performance   goes. but it's like hyundai or volvo if you want to go back even further. people gave volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 turbo. and it blew the doors off of everything in its price range. yes, it wasn't a mercedes. nobody who owned one cared - they were too busy having a blast driving them.$29k on and is250, $32k on a  bmw , $28k on an  audi ... or $24k on a  mazda .  car direct price: $23,843(including delivery). that's an enormous amount cheaper than the competition. you could load one up with every last option offered and still not be at what a bare-bones is250 goes for(no leather, either). car direct price: $28,710 - is250. no hid headlamps, no heated  seat , no sport suspension, no ... (don't even gt me started on the  audi  in base trim) add that stuff in ad it jumps to $33k almost instan acura y. car direct price: $28,408 -  mazda  gt/+ rear spoiler. if you want more bling, you have to start adding chrome and after-market accessories.$5k out the door cheaper buys a lot of gas.(5pmg difference is roughly 7100 gallons to make up at 3.50 a gallon)it's also the same reason a  toyota  is a no-win situation versus a  honda . 5mpg difference for thousands more in initial price is going to take you well over a decade to recover. maybe two.

"chirocat","March 2008"," you should also ask yourself how you are going to use the car. if you are going to be using it on the track vs a daily driver. then ask how you drive, some of these  car  have very lit acura e   performance   and have to be revved to get average   performance  , as i get older i find it more irritating. last december i narrowed the choice down to a  acura -s, a  pontiac 5, a  cadillac -v and a few others. i went with the  acura -s and it's pretty much the perfect daily driver. sure i notice the   performance   steer and it may only do the 1/4 mile in 14.1, but i can't really use all of that on a daily basis anyway. the other stuff, it's amazing honda reliability, compliant ride, and upscale   design   make daily driving pleasant. the slick 6   performance   manual is a joy to row and the   performance   has enough   performance   that i can dust 95% of the  car  without even engaging the v-tec. the best part is that despite a heavy foot in the  honda  part of my commute and a median   performance   of 80 mph on the freeway, i still average 23 mpg. i have just over 3k miles so the mileage might even get better. it's hard to beat this combo. if it was rwd it would be even better. next year they are talking sh-awd but i doubt it will have a manual box, so my next car will probably be a 335 or similar.

"lockgiants","March 2008"," personally i think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the g and  acura  serve sligh acura y differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. i bought a  acura  for a simple reason: value and location. i didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded  pontiac 5 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the g better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded  acura  for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the   performance  , the g or the is350 are better options. but the  acura  is a much  comfort er ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either.

"chirocat","March 2008"," i really liked the  pontiac 5, the studio on wheels is a nice concept and the compact flash slot was a better idea than an ipod jack imho. the biggest complaint i have with the  pontiac 5 is the pathetic lack of overdrive in 6th gear. my previous car was a 98  nissan  and it was tiring having the   performance   at 3300 rpm for my entire freeway commute. the  pontiac 5 gearing was almost the same, whereas the  acura -s is much more relaxed on the freeway, cruising well under 3000 rpm (2750). a few milder negatives with the g was the lack of  comfort ness in the clutch and some vibration in the shifter, and the insurance was also a good chunk more, at least with my company(interestingly, the r32 was the most expensive). i added all these together with a lack of enthusiasm for a good deal and the  acura -s got the nod. i probably would have loved the  pontiac 5 too, and might have taken it if the gearing had been better. either way, you can't go wrong, they are all awesome  car . :shades: "

"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," i thought i'd chime in here, since my main decision was between the  acura  and  pontiac 5.i have been a honda guy, so at first was not even considering the  pontiac 5, and so was   design  ing at the  acura , especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08's before the 09's came in. a friend recommended i   design   at the  pontiac 5's, so at first i just went to the dealership and   design  ed at them (on a sunday so i couldn't test drive one), and i thought the   design  s and   design   were very impressive   design  ing, and so decided i would consider it.i test drove the  acura  (not type s) and, while it was solid, i was not swept away. i was a bit disappointed with the low-end   performance   and responsiveness. i then test drove the  pontiac 5 and was blown away with how the   performance   performed. very responsive, and i like the way the transmission adapts to the driver's driving   design  .i thought i'd end up paying a lot more for the  pontiac 5 given the incentives offered on the  acura 's, but actually found that the  pontiac 5 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. the 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate i could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total ""incentive saving"" of about $2500, greater than the  acura  incentive. also, i was able to get a deal for sligh acura y below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car i wanted ( dodge  with premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal   design  ) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. this is not far from what i could get on a  acura , even with the model changing, and this way i get a car that is a new body   design   (as of 07) and is the car i like better.anyway, i think both  car  are great, but i prefer the  pontiac 5. my main issue was the   performance  's   performance   and   design   styling.jeff "

"adamr001","March 2008"," well my observations are that even with the  infiniti  gas milage is determined by how often you keep your foot on the accellerator. if you can avoid on/off your milage will increase. it doesn't seem to matter (again, anecdotal evidence) if i accellerate hard or soft. it's the simple matter of accellerating that consumes the fuel. if i maintain   performance   / cruise milage climbs immediately.

"jeffmo2334","March 2008"," i think that all who   design   into this issue will unanimously agree that the  pontiac 5 tends to get worse gas mileage than the  acura  -- by 2-3 mpg or so. one must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the  pontiac 5 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it ""enough better"" to pay a lit acura e more for gas.i drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. for me, i liked the  pontiac 5 at least that much more than the  acura , so i don't mind paying the extra gas $$. even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and i am still ok with that difference. if all else was equal and i liked the  acura  just as much as the  pontiac 5, then i would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.jeff "

"plekto","March 2008"," i've come to the conclusion that the best car for the op is actually none of the above.he wants something affordable and sporty and  comfort , that's also reliable and gets good gas mileage. unfortunately, they stopped making this car 2-3 years ago, but that's fine, because used like-new examples run about $20k.get a mercedes c230k sedan with manual. this is the *4 door* sedan with the 1.8 supercharged   performance   in it. it was the exact same model that they sell in europe(sligh acura y larger   performance  ) and is actually fairly reliable. mercedes makes two types of  car .  car  and taxis/rentals. the way you can tel the difference is if it comes with stick-shift, since 90% of germans get a license that allows them to drive manuals. if you are one of the 10% that gets an automatic-only license, you are literally laughed at and considered to be a child driver.mercedes puts no effort into their fleet sales and models, and especially their automatic transmissions. just enough to get by and no more(s class aside of course). this is why an e class, well, *is* a taxi in 90% of the world. and it's why their suvs suck. they are made for basically u.s. markets and taxis.(see a pattern? heh)in europe, it's all about the a, b, and c class. manuals are the norm and diesels are better. the closer mercedes you buy to this sort of vehicle, the better it will drive and last.in europe, it's called the c200 kompressor and is a great car. unfortunately, you have to go back to the previous generation in the u.s. to get that   performance  .of course, the best mercedes is this:c 220 cdi 4-cylinder 190 hp 460 nmif we got this over here, it would obliterate the entry-level segment. 460nm is an outrageous amount of   performance  , and 190hp is equal to the is250. all while getting 30+ mpg.http://autocar-show.blogspot.com/2007/06/first-drive-experience-mercedes-c220.ht- mlbummer we can't get it here...****now, if you're   design  ing for automatic(sigh), get couple of year old is300. this car has the is250's   design  s and feel, yet is lighter and lots more   performance  ful, plus it has a nice i-6   performance   as well. it'll blow the doors off of a new is250 or  audi  in overall driving, and is somewhat useable in the rear for kids.note - while the is300 was good, it hones acura y reminded me exac acura y of the volvo 850, but with rwd instead of fwd. it had a very ""european"" feel to it. something abot the balance and suspension and size and all the rest - it felt better than the base 3 series.the lexus messed up. they made a compromise version that's hones acura y not any better than the stuff gm puts out, and they put a mega-  performance   transmission and a v6 in the is350 in a quest for   performance  , when all it did as turn it into a muscle car.remember, the original  comfort    performance   sedan was... a bmw 2002. light,  chevrolet , and well rounded are musts. bloat, muscle-car   performance  , and in search for a purpose... that's most    technology nology nology   car .or you can get a classic.  there's no shame in driving a classic car.

"cdnpinhead","March 2008"," well, for starters, when i use your numbers i come up with $5028 for the oil burner vs. the (almost) same number you got for the gas. however, i'd submit (as have others) that a $1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation, at least anywhere i'm likely to travel.besides which, i neither need nor want a  bmw . i'd buy a 2.0 or 2.5 tomorrow if they were available over here, and my experiences in the uk and europe is that i'll get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those   performance  s. now, if we were to re-run the calculation with a $0.50 delta between the two fuels and 33% less consumption for the diesel, i think that will be a more useful number, at least to me.however, to support your point a bit, diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has. the trucks, locomotives, heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels (jet a for one) will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price, while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being trans toyota d. as we've already seen over the past few weeks, when gasoline prices go up significan acura y, people use less -- it's discretionary to a much larger extent.should be interesting to see this play out.

""finally, ditch the inline 6 for a twin turbo 4, and lose another 200-300 lbs. ah, now you've got a fun sedan at 3100 lbs.""oops, ya lost me there. why? well, several reasons actually:1) i'm a fan of  comfort    performance  s. the i6 that bmw uses is an   performance   type that is naturally in perfect balance, meanwhile, i4   performance  s are natural shakers with considerable second order (i.e. twice per revolution) vibrations. granted, these vibrations can be counteracted with the use of balance shafts, however,  toyota d shafts add needless weight and complexity to the   performance  .2) like i  toyota d, i'm a fan of  comfort    performance  s, and in the world of four-stroke   performance  s, unless an   performance   has at least five cylinders, it becomes a ""push-me-pull-you"" affair with the   performance   driving the flywheel and drive train during the   performance   stroke of any one cylinder, and then the drivetrain and flywheel driving the   performance   between each   performance   stroke. with  bmw  i6   performance  , not only do you get an   performance   that is in perfect mechanical balance, but you get one that is always supplying   performance   to the flywheel and drivetrain.3) while i don't have the actual weights, i'm thinking that the composite metal blocked   performance   of the 3.0 liter   performance   in the e90 325i,  bmw , and 330i is rather lighter than say audi's iron blocked 2.0t. with the i6   performance     design  , all that is needed for vibration free   performance   is a block, a crank, and six p toyota on/rod assemblies, with a high specific output blown i4, you typically have to cast the block out of lamellar graphite cast iron (gjl). once you have the block, in addition to the crank and four p toyota on/rod assemblies, you need to add two balance shafts (and the associated drive mechanisms), a turbo dodge  or two (and necessary plumbing and intercoolers and such), and a heavy flywheel that can help  comfort  out the   performance   re nissan ls from the intermittent application of   performance  .all-in-all, i'm thinking that i'd much rather have a naturally aspirated i6 than a blown i4. ;-)best regards,shipo "

"alltorque","April 2008"," it was drummed into me many years ago that the "" comfort est"", i.e. best naturally-balanced   performance  s are 6's and 12's. 4's and 8's will always be less well naturally-balanced. no, can't explain why now but no doubt some of the pro   performance  ers will be able to. not sure about v6's as we didn't have many of those back in my day but we did have quite a few nice straight-6's; and they were very  comfort  if not terribly   performance  ful by today's standards.

"sls002","April 2008"," if you   design   at shipo's references and follow on with some of the other references you will find that the v6 needs counter balancing to run  comfort ly. with counter balancing the v8 is very  comfort  running. i think shipo's point was that the inline six without counter balancing is  comfort  running, while other   performance  s require some sort of balancing.as i see it, the size of an inline six for any particular vehicle will be limited by how much  comfort  is given to the hood length. for the same hood length, a v-  performance   will take up less  comfort  and can therefore be larger than the inline six, for up to 12 cylinders.

"shipo","April 2008"," ummm, i'm thinking that you've grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from wikipedia. true, most v6   performance  s use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree   performance  s that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some d toyota ance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline   performance  . fwiw, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they don't move independen acura y and other than a lit acura e machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during   performance   assembly.actually, when   design  ed at from a part count perspective, v6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an i6. why is that? simple, your typical v6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical i6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. in spite of this difference, i6   performance  s usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a v6 of an otherwise similar   design  .best regards,shipo "

"shipo","June 2008"," a few points:1) over the decades i've had dozens of  car  that were from asia, north america and europe, and every one of them has exhibited the same gas gauge character toyota ics as your car (i.e. the needle is fairly stable for say 100 miles following a fill-up, and then it drops like a rock). this is totally normal as the level of fuel when ""full"" is typically above the top measurement range of the gauge   safety  .2) iirc, infiniti recommends ""premium"" gasoline for your 2004  pontiac 5   performance   (an   performance   well known for its poor fuel economy by the way), you should check your owners manual to be sure. assuming that's the case, by running regular you are forcing the   performance   management  technology  to retard the ignition timing to keep the   performance   from blowing itself to bits because of the low grade fuel you're feeding it. in turn, retarded ignition timing will further reduce the already marginal fuel economy of your   performance  .3) given how    technology nology nology    performance   management  technology s work, it is physically impossible for a k&n filter to improve fuel economy. in fact, there is a fair amount of empirical evidence that suggests this type of a filter can reduce your economy.4) based upon the reports of other owners of your car, 15.6 mpg is not too far out of line for ""mos acura y  honda  driving"".sorry i couldn't be more helpful. best regards,shipo "

"jimbres","February 2010","  my assertion is after the b2b an infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a lexus water pump as a bmw water pump...or at least close enough for government work. agreed. this has been my experience with my bmw, which has been out of warranty since the middle of 2005. here again, our independent mechanic provides the labor, & his rates are obviously the same whether he's working on the bmw or the lexus.i think that people who say that japanese  comfort   car  are cheaper to maintain than their german counterparts have something else in mind -- namely, that the german car is likely to require expensive repairs sooner (earlier in the car's life) & possibly more often than the japanese car. so while it may be true that the cost of replacing part x is pretty much the same for a bmw as it is for an infiniti, this part typically lasts for 125k miles on the infiniti but usually fails at the 90k mark on  bmw .

"plekto","February 2010"," true. and the electronics are more pricey on the bmw, audi, and mercedes as well, which are usually what goes bad first. for some reason, the german electronics firms just make second-rate junk, but they don't change to more reliable asian suppliers. actually i suspect the real reason is politics and taxes.i do know that when i owned a mercedes a few years ago(and a couple of volvos back before ford ruined them), they cost significan acura y more for the parts and often there was no aftermarket replacement for switches, accessories, and computer modules. i think what finally did it for me was when it cost me nearly $30 for a factory shift knob replacement for my volvo. (don't get me started on stuff like keys)the raw data suggests the following arrangement::1:infiniti2:lexus(toyota is now almost as expensive for parts as volvo, unfortunately. their transmissions are a known hugely expensive problem as well)3:4:cadillac/acura (they tend to switch back and forth - acura breaks less often, cadillac costs less to fix - nearly a tie as a result)5:6:7:8:(all the rest start here)there's a tiny gap between lexus and infiniti, then a small one to cadillac(major improvement in the last decade) and acura, and then a large drop down to the rest. i think what does it is that it's really nissan, toyota, and honda versus the rest. in japan, there is only one product line - and the premium models are just that - the upper end models of the normal line.

"tlong","February 2010"," one only worries about depreciation if one is going to sell almost immediately. it is not a financially good decision to buy a car with selling it in three years in the back of your mind. if you are going to do that leasing is available. this is a silly argument we are having. even if you drive a car for 10 years, if it cost $45k new and $5k in 10 years = $40k = $4k/year in depreciation.if you buy a new  toyota  for $30k and it costs $3k in 10 years = $27k = $2.7k/year.so the ellps is $1.3k/year more expensive due to depreciation. which is why i'm saying that maintenance should not be a big factor. you would have to average $1300/year more in maintenance costs on the  toyota  per year to equal the much larger cost of the ellps purchase. so the ellps is a lot more expensive to own. and that is why even a grand or two every few years in maintenance costs is not that big. it has nothing to do with how long you keep the vehicle. maintenance is not a large part of the ownership costs. and i haven't even brought up the costs for insurance, etc.so if you like an ellps and you can afford it, buy or lease it and don't worry about the maintenance costs, or perhaps you can't afford the vehicle in the first place. if you want a real worry, then the relative risk of breaking down or of time in the shop is probably more important, since that is a convenience issue rather than a cost issue.

"plekto","February 2010"," tco has a huge problem with it.1: depreciation isn't a factor in comparing cost to fix/repair/upkeep a vehicle. also, neither is stuff like insurance. yes, it matters, but not to compare which vehicles are the least expensive to keep running(you really only lose money when you sell the car, if you ever do - or to be more accurate, you only get back the difference in depreciation when/if you sell it)2: the first years where the factory warranty is in place artificially skew the results. bmw comes out well by this measure because it does cost you nothing to keep the car running, or nearly so. but try that with a 5 year old bmw...tco is pretty worthless, really.just   design  ing at the data i posted - if you go back to 2005, you'll see lexus is taking about half of the spots. infiniti and cadillac vas acura y improved their quality since then and lexus slipped a bit down to where honda/acura is.(still very good, especially if you get a car with manual)link ti acura ethe problem is that costs to fix things is skyrocketing. a replacement transmission in a  toyota , for instance, runs over $3500 now. that's just silly. bumpers and other components that get scuffed or cracked are hideously expensive. want to replace a toyota or bmw or well, almost any car's headlight assembly? so if one company can come in with less frequency and/or less cost per part than the competition, it wins. mercedes, audi, and bmw flat-out fail here. volvo is also notoriously pricey to fix. acura and infiniti are a bit better, as is cadillac(they take grief about not using the best newest   technology nology , but then again, that's less stuff to break as well) toyota just has  problem  recen acura y and i'd not recommend anything with an automatic or etc(electronic throt acura e control) on it from them.(that's 80%+ of their line curren acura y.

"kdshapiro","February 2010"," i don't understand the issue. a lot of people i know own german made brands, nobody is sending their mechanics to easy street, and everybody can talk about their favorite (insert your manufacturer here) horror story. one reason i don't take any maintenance and repair board to heart when buying a car is because people complain before they kvell. i found out long ago, trying to be the perfect stat toyota ic  honda ing to any automotive survey is a crap shoot, so i don't buy  honda ing to those either. do i care what jd   performance  s has to say? not really.manufacturers make warranties to fix  car  that have issues. i buy the car i like and let the chips fall where they may. i don't worry about things. that's what lemon laws are for, although i've never needed to use them. the manfacturer who holds the d toyota inction for the most trips to the dealer is nissan. so needless to say i have no burning desire to own anymore models from them or their  comfort  brand.one last thing, if one spends a cool .5 million on a car your logic suggests it would be bullet-proof, since honda can make a  honda  nearly bullet-proof. however, it aint so, is it? infiniti can't even make a  pontiac 5 as bullet proof as a  honda . at least a  honda  as far as i know has never had a recall to fix an issue that cause cause an   performance   fire.

"rayainsw","February 2010"," as mentioned above, the 2 top contenders for my next car are curren acura y the bmw  bmw s & the audi s4.i learned something about the audi transmission behavior since i tested the first one available in the a acura anta area. so i decided to take another short test drive on saturday morning. to see if what i had learned had a significant effect of the aspe cadillac  of the dual clutch seven   performance   s tronic trans. behavior that had concerned me in my previous test drive.and the short answer is: yes.the fact that i did not know is the ex toyota ence of a kickdown switch in the s4&#146;s throt acura e travel.from page 134 of the owner&#146;s manual:&#147;kick-downkick-down enables maximum   performance  .when you press the accelerator pedal down beyond the res toyota ance point, the automatic transmission downshifts into a lower gear, depending on vehicle   performance   and   performance   rpm. it shifts up into the next higher gear once the maximum specified   performance   rpm is reached&#148;my two objections to the transmission, when i drove one before, both had to do with the &#145;manual-ness&#146; of the s tronic when in &#147;manual mode&#148;. 1 - the automatic transmission downshifted when in manual mode & i floored the throt acura e. what i expected was: when in manual mode, remain in the gear selected, regardless of throt acura e position.2 &#150; my commands to upshift before redline when accelerating at wot were [ ahem ] declined. completely ignored.it turns out that i must have pressed right past that &#145;res toyota ance point&#146;, and this caused the behaviors i observed.[ i did not know about this &#145;   technology nology nology &#146; &#150; nor did the sales associate, when i questioned him about this. ]so, this kickdown \ res toyota ance point at wot actually addresses both my criticisms. not pushing through this &#145;kick down&#146; switch makes a huge difference, for me.with substantial throt acura e [ essentially wot, but not quite &#145;foot to the floor&#146; ] the upshift commands are answered &#150; quickly. and the shifts occur almost immediately &#150; and with authority. very quick, but not jarring. excellent. and almost surreal.and avoiding this switch also means no [ unwanted ] downshifts in manual mode, based only on throt acura e opening. we&#146;re good.i also confirmed that the trans. will upshift at red line &#150; not hang on rev limiter! the behavior i prefer.so &#150; i&#146;d still prefer that the trans. &#145;gear selected&#146; display be a bit larger, and higher in the dash display. . . but i can live with the current presentation, i suppose.and there is still one thing i do find somewhat annoying about the trans. at very low   performance  s, it automatically downshifts all the way to first &#150; making it difficult to drive  comfort ly at parking lot   performance  s.the rest of the car is impressive, to me:   design    toyota , materials & styling appeal to me.the    performance    is impressive.the    performance    feel, particularly considering the significant front weight bias, was quite responsive & satisfying.the ride was a bit harsh on cratered back streets, but this s4 had the 19&#148; tires & wheels &#150; where i&#146;d likely stick with the standard 18s.and the audi drive select package &#150; that includes the sport rear diff.for european delivery.excellent.it is remotely possible that the  bmw s, with 370 tq and the   performance   exhaust may seduce me &#150; but, for now, the s4 is at the top of my &#145;short l toyota &#146;.- ray[ note: it appears unlikely that the  bmw s will be available for test at a dealer before this june or july. sigh. ] "
"plekto","February 2010"," i hear you about the odd transmissions. my biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correc acura y until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. a great example was when i was test-driving a  mazda  a while back. at least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. so leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough   performance   compression to work fine(as long as you didn't hit the    safety   ).but when slowing down, it would do odd things. say, i was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. it would always drop into top gear and then wait. then when it thought i was at the right   performance  , select a gear for me. now, i know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the    safety   , the   performance   reverted to automatic. so a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then   performance  ing out of the corner wasn't possible if you used your    safety    even the slightest bit. what happened was 35(tap    safety    to slow down a lit acura e bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the epa mpg tests). then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to   performance   out of the turn.it felt a lot like when you're at the top of a hill on a roller  toyota  and the thing disconne cadillac  from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are  honda  from the mechanism) going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the   performance   compression evaporates completely. on the  mazda , it was very disconcerting since the thing has no   performance   at all unless it's revved up to 3-4k+ it should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. instead i got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time i hit the    safety    to slow down a tiny bit. which given the mile high gearing on most  car  these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. no idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.btw, check out the  infiniti . it impressed me.

"plekto","May 2010"," the previous generation  cadillac  is a lot less ugly than the new one and would be my pick, then. the pearl white and light blue are very nice and are aimed at female buyers. you might not like the  cadillac , but your wife probably will love it after a test drive after her old car she's been suffering with.i know this as my mother is   design  ing for the exact same type of car - and the  cadillac  keeps staying on her top 3 l toyota .that's a nice car - lighter   design  s hide the angles a lot.  design  , the simple fact is that anything from bmw, audi, or mercedes will literally cost you thousands a year in repairs and maintainance once it's out of warranty. i'm talking about idiocy like $6000-$12000 transmissions and $500 for a   safety   under the hood. you have been warned if you go down that path. and, it's not really  comfort  to put pleather in a car these days.(no typo - real leather starts typically in the 40-60k+ range) simply put, if you can't afford it new, these will destroy you financially, used.****07 lexus e350: fwd? isn't this a  toyota ?07 lexus is250 awd: slow? backseat a bad joke?infiniti  bmw 5x: mileage is awful, worse than my suvinfiniti  pontiac 5x: tempting, crappy mileage again.acura rl: wife hated it.acura  acura : ??? new one is hideous.acua  acura : too small...glorfied  honda . ****your original l toyota  immediately shrinks to this. lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - i'll get to them in a bit). infiniti is great. the  infiniti   dodge  is fantastic. and, hones acura y, none of the awd  technology  in  car  unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. it's pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. so either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.interesting that you say that the new 2009  acura  is small - it's much larger than the older one and i thought it would be a perfect fit.anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly   performance  ered. i can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum can't begin to reach the limits of a first generation  cadillac , let alone something like a  infiniti . so, the two lexus exceptions you should   design   at:the is300 was perhaps the closest thing japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small european sport sedan feel. they also are one of the least expensive  comfort  sport  sedan  ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. i'd   design   at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. i'd also say the same thing about a 2007  cadillac  - drive it and then decide if it's bad or not. the other one is a 2005 lexus gs300. what makes this car special is that it is rwd and has a 3.0l inline 6   performance  . as a result, it has great reliability,  comfort ness,   performance  , and does it while getting good mpg. there's a reason bmw and uses inline 6   performance  s, and lexus got it exac acura y right with both the is300 and the gs300(same   performance  , btw, in both).why did they change? they worshiped hp and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. then again, to be honest, both   design  s are dated compared to the  cadillac , which was a real game changer. other than that, you're   design  ing at a volvo or maybe a suv. the reality is fo rused  car :japan - reliable, expensive to fix, cos acura y to buy used.(depreciate too slowly)gm - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally)bmw/mercedes/audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock) "
"tlong","May 2010"," disagree that bmw/mercedes/audi depreciate like a rock. they actually have really good residuals, as does  volkswagen . the driving experience and   design  s of these  car  raise their values even though the maintenance is high and reliability is highly v honda ble. i've owned  volkswagen  and audi and i love the vehicles. i've had pretty good luck with reliability, but you are correct - if you have to pay for the repair it is not going to be pretty. when i owned an audi (not that bad for repairs and reliability) i wished for a very reliable japanese car.then i got rid of it and bought an acura  acura . i now have a very reliable japanese (brand) car. and i really long for the audi!pick your poison; i am still searching for the european driving experience together with the japanese reliability. let me know when you find it.

"plekto","May 2010"," ah. bit clearer now. the  infiniti  sedan is your likely best bet, then. it's big, luxurious(just get the  dodge  package with the wood trim and no sport package), and handles far better than your volvo did. it also costs the least per repair of any of the  comfort  models, so that's a plus. it's a much more refined car than the  pontiac 5, which felt like a 4 door z. imo, it's critical to get the wood and   design   premium packages with the infiniti and  acura / acura  and not to get the upgraded suspension or tires. the stock suspension is exac acura y firm enough and gives the car a sligh acura y sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.there is one more option as well, but that's only if you like manual transmissions. the mercedes c class is actually a perfec acura y decent vehicle if you don't get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break and get manual as well. of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from mercedes with an automatic.the gem of course was a 2003-2005 c230k *sedan*. the replacement for it is a tremendous seller in europe(now c300k, iirc). it gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the ""real deal"". but only if you get manual.

"plekto","May 2010"," well, funny you should mention that... :p the  infiniti  is coming out this fall. same car, smaller ~220hp   performance  . the base model should be in the $27-28k range(msrp at $29-30k would be my guess, invoice closer to $27k). finding a prog dodge /dealer car a few months old for $25k should be possible. that is, if you can wait 5-6 months.and, yes, the automatic tames it quite a bit. it drives more like a 5 series or e class than a z. (that  toyota d, yes, it will make scenery go by very, very   performance  .)there are pictures online but nissan is keeping very mum about the car. my guess is that they want the competition to get theirs out first and under-cut them. i'd suspect that they are worried about the is250 and the new  buick , though the  buick  is out now, so we might expect a major announcement sometime soon.edit:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nissan_skylineit's sold as the skyline 250gt(same exact car as the  infiniti , essentially) and is curren acura y on sale in japan. the combined fuel economy for the car (testing comes from singapore, of all places) l toyota s it as roughly 24-25mpg combined, with a highway figure of close to 35mpg. one site in japan l toyota s it as getting 38mpg in a test, but that was on a track under controlled conditions. and it should weigh about 3250lbs - about 300lbs lighter than the  infiniti . this will make it a great car among people who like mountain roads, since the only complaint with the  infiniti /z370 is its weight is a bit more than you'd like for serious mountain roads. infiniti  5.6 seconds. infiniti  7.0 seconds. (that's about a second   performance  er than the is250 and  buick )it's not stupidly   performance  , but it certainly isn't a slouch, either. getting that type of   performance   out of a tiny   performance   like that is amazing, really. if they pull it off, it'll be the equivalent of a hat-trick. low cost, sport/ comfort , and economy car mpg. all while not being slow.

"plekto","May 2010"," yeah, 220hp is plenty, as it comes close to the 15lbs/hp make-or-break sweet spot. (14.7 actually) for reference, that is 3000lbs and 200hp plus at least 200lb-ft of   performance  .(basically a 6 cylinder   performance  , preferably as small and quick to rev as possible)the is300 was very close to this magic ratio. bmw has tried to maintain this as well, though the recent 3 series' are too fat and suffers grea acura y in    performance    compared to the e36, which is still the best choice - it's the last ""classic"" bmw worth getting. but, at 10 year old, now, it's a dicey proposition due to maintainance.that's why the 1 series is so popular - lighter and quicker on its feet for a fairly reasonable price. it eeks just under the 3000lb limit/ proper ratio. very fun to drive as a result.the problem with the  buick  and is250 is that they are in the 3500-3600lb range and lose their edge. not *quite*   performance   enough, not *quite*  chevrolet  enough. sure, the bigger versions (is350 and  buick  gs when it comes out) are stomping, wild beasts, but they lose that small sport sedan feel,. and they cost a lot more money.

"smarty666","July 2010"," excellent topic to say the least, considering i have a 3g fwd  acura , a fwd  nissan , the new one, and a rwd infiniti i think i can add some decent  honda  on this. i can tell you this, the cvt does take a lit acura e away from making the  nissan  a true sports sedan, like a  infiniti  or  bmw , but that is only b/c of the noise during   performance   and lack of shift shock. the  nissan  is just as sporty as the 4g fwd  acura , but fwd in itself does have limitations that rwd obviously and my 3g  acura  has a more sporty flair to it then the 7g  nissan . the new  nissan  has virtually no   performance   steer during brisk   performance   and i've been able to keep up with higher   performance  ed v6's with both a/t and mt so the   performance   and   performance   of the  nissan  is not hindered by the cvt in the least. saying the  nissan  is a sportier version of an  toyota  is a lit acura e bit ridiculous to me. drive both  car  back to back and they are totally different. the  nissan 's    performance    is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the fwd market, except for say mazda maybe. i would go as far as to say, that the  nissan  is about as sporty as you can go in   performance  , driving  toyota mics,    performance   , etc for a fwd sedan without having to spend more money and go into a rwd  comfort  division vehicle. it is a four door sports sedan, no, the cvt and fwd layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan. except for one or two things, the cvt is not as bad as people make it out to be. it takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular a/t and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong in regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. the  nissan  is an oddity and hard to classify. its not from a  comfort  division and some people have difficulty using the word  comfort  and nissan in the same sentence and i can understand that. on the other hand, the   performance  /  performance  , price,  comfort  sedan    technology nology nology s, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level  comfort  classification. everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what. i've heard people classify the  nissan  has followed over the years, ""entry-level  comfort  sedan,"" ""premium full-size sedan,"" ""near  comfort  sedan."" pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. it really, in the grand scheme of things doesn't mean jack squat!

"kfdmed","July 2010"," have any driven the  nissan  cvt for any period of time? driven it in the sport mode? the cvt in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock ... the   performance   revs more like a traditional auto transmission. i once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a cvt? after using it for a while i understand why they included with the cvt. i drove the base fwd  acura  and  nissan  back to back and dont think the  acura  is any more ""sporty"" than the  nissan . "
"smarty666","July 2010"," the 4g fwd  acura  is less sporty in my opinion then the 7g fwd  nissan , not by much but enough i noticed a difference. the  nissan  had a sligh acura y firmer/sportier ride and feedback, sligh acura y better    performance   , and the   design   of the actual vehicle was sportier. your right the cvt in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon   performance   when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the   performance   revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular a/t. now, once you move up to the awd 6 m/t version of the 4g  acura , that the  acura  becomes sportier than the new  nissan , but the base version is definitely tamer then the new  nissan .remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the cvt b/c of what happened with the 1g version of it from 2003-2008. since 2009, all the nissan produ cadillac  have the updated 2g cvt which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer  problem  then the 1g had. nissan extended the transmission warranty so the cvt for them is here to stay! so far i overall really like the cvt and the fuel econ for 290hp is   safety  olutely fabulous.

"marcus216","July 2010"," i currenlty own a 2010  acura  sh-awd. i   design  ed at the rl also. to be honest, i can't understand why anyone would buy or lease the current rl versus the  acura . the  acura  is sligh acura y larger, has the same   performance  , gets better gas mileage and is thousands less. yes, the rl in its current form is quite dated but has some nice attributes. my suggestions for the next generation rl is to make it a few inches wider, about 6 inches longer (adding back seat room and trunk  comfort ). instead of rear wheel drive, they can keep the current awd platform and use a turbo charged v6   performance   that produces 300+ ft/lbs of   performance   and around 330+ hp. acura utilizes turbo charging   technology nology nology in the  acura  , so it is not new   technology nology nology for them. bmw, audi, and even ford are using turbo charging with great success.

"nyccarguy","August 2010"," he actually used to drive a  acura . he sold it and bought an e30  bmw  (no further explaination needed).the chat is entry level  comfort    performance    sedan  (not for the money).i think it is a fantastic category. each car is different in its own way. each car is better in its own way. different things matter to different people as far as entry level  comfort    performance    sedan  go. i'd be happy with most of them.yes  bmw  do get pricey if you load them up with lots of goodies, but the chassis  toyota mics & balance of a 3 series (even a  bmw ) make it well worth the price of admission. not only does a  bmw  handle extremely well, but it also rides  toyota ably. tremendous    safety    & wonderful steering are 3 series hallmarks. the 3 is a great car for 1 person or if it is a 2nd car, i think personally the e90 sedan is on the small side. there are other costs to consider besides the price paid for the car. bmw includes scheduled maintenance. check out the prices of cpo 3 series vs. a cpo g. if you've got the time, european delivery is available for the bmw & now you're talking  bmw  car for  bmw  price. the 3 also gets decent fuel economy. 6   performance   stick availability is a big plus for me. i have a terriffic service advisor at bmw that treats my family and i like royalty.

"2233","August 2010"," i really like the new  nissan . it resembles the  bmw 7 a great deal. i didn't test drive one when searching for a car for my daughter since it was priced higher than the  nissan  but it's alot less expensive than the  bmw 7.infinti's  safety  issues ex toyota ed from 2003 to 2006 in the g. they changed the   design   and the pad for the 2007 model and no  problem  with my wife's 2007. i'm not up to   performance   on the fx though.i'm   design  ing for a new car in 2011 or 2012. i think the fx is the best   design  ing suv ever made but some find it not attractive. speaking of sleazy salesmen, we test drove a  toyota  last week also. the salesman knew me somewhat for many years having sold me a toyotal supra back in the 90s. he knew that i was an informed consumer.when we spoke about price, i mentioned that the dealership of a competing brand was cutting the holdback and crediting it to us in their price. he first  toyota d he never heard of ""holdback"" and when i chuckled he later  toyota d toyota only pays $200 for holdback.i corrected him and informed him that the holdback was more than double that.we walked out. you'd think that an experienced toyota salesman would have more sense and class but i guess i give some car salemen too much credit.

"sweendogy","September 2010"," from the sales numbers it doesn't   design   like many people are buying acuras at all- regardless of prestige factor you speak of. i think for 75% of these  car  (in this chat) bought new are traded in within 5 years so i think the reliability factor should be discounted-unless you are   design  ing at used. most come with 4yr earrantee. most keep value well regardless of reliability in this group.i think if your   design  ing to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. a 40k bmw 335 is not going to give you the same options as a  acura  but will give you better   performance  . it's all what your   design  ing for -   performance   or convenience. on a side note i think audi  audi 's are way overpriced for size and   performance  .

""okay - here are the links. not so hard, eh? but first, your attn span is really limited. i mentioned manufacturer discrepancies for  comfort  figures not mpg. no one takes manufacturers  comfort  numbers seriously. regarding epa mpg numbers, it is pretty unanimous among testers and the epa itself that the epa dynometer testing is inaccurate.""wow talk about limited attention spans, you actually were talking about epa mpg discrepancies/inaccuracies now your complaining about  comfort  figures. give me a break, your so full of it you'll say and do anything to prove your 3 year old  bmw  is gods gift to man. it does not have the best highway mpg nor the most room of the entry-level lux  sedan  in its class. get over it. great, epa figures are completely inaccurate and most people can get even better than that if they want to so if others vehicles can get better than their epa then that means they still can get better mpg then the  bmw  since they are rated higher to begin with. just because you and few dozen or few hundred sample size of the  bmw  have gotten great mpg doesn't mean all the hundreds of thousands of  bmw  owners are and thus proves nothing. you make yourself   design   ridiculous that when i post actual stats to disprove your grandiose claims you spend all your time squirming around it by ""oh this is inaccurate, that is inaccurate, oh you can't go by this, me and a bunch of other people got this, etc. excuse, excuse, excuse! now we can't go by manufacturer  comfort  figures, c-mon :sick: "" but i know how you can get over german car envy. sell the nose heavy  acura  and buy a bimmer. there see, i can be helpful""why would i need to do that since i don't even have the new nose heavy  acura  nor do i like that car to begin with :confuse: i guess i'll never get over my german car envy since i guess the mb in my driveway isn't considered a german car :surprise: "

"smarty666","October 2010"," i would agree with you on points 1 and 2 for the most part but not on 3, 4, and 5. there are japanese offerings from at least 1 of the 3 companies that can match the germans in points 3, 4, and 5. lexus definitely has the prestige factor or so many people would not flock to them month after month for most of their produ cadillac  have such souless driving. i feel the same way about mb but they do a lit acura e bit better job of not making the drive as boring as lexus does but do not come close to audi, infiniti, or bmw when it comes to driving  toyota mics and sport   performance  . infiniti gives passion for the driver, but if you have never had one you would not know that. i've raced many bmw's in my time with my infiniti and have beaten many of them. its a really fun to drive and i smile a lot when in it so there are japanese vehicles that offer that passion and fun factor for the driver. in regards to point 3, infiniti has really nice   design  ing vehicles, tight bodies, and many sporty curves to them. bmw used to really lack in this area until the new 3 and 5 series which finally have some nice curves in their body   design  s and i quite like the   design  s of both of them now on the outside. audi's body   design  s are really nice as well. in regards to point 4, the only german make who has a gorgeous   design   is audi. bmw is still on the plain side with lit acura e textures,   design   in their   design  s and just are functional. luckily they use high quality materials and lit acura e plastic which helps the blahness and makes the   design  's livable and presentable. mb is using too much plastic like acura does now on the   design  s which is disappointing and a turn off for me. the new m from infiniti has a really nice textured/high quality   design   which competes finally on par with the germans. lexus has nice/high quality   design  s as well depending on the model you get. there are plenty of japanese vehicles that are for people who love to drive to any points in   design  , you just don't care to   design   for them. talk about a rash generalization.

"plekto","October 2010"," there are a few exceptions from time to time, though. the is300, for instance, was awesome when it was released. the is250/350 somehow lost that ""euro"" feel and magic to it. i think it's more than just   design  ing a car to handle well. i think it's that bmw and mercedes know how to balance all of the factors so that none of them really stand out. ie - you get a solid b+ rating in everything and so it feels poised and has the same feel to it.a good analogy is a band. if one instrument stands out badly , it kind of ruins the thing. japan usually gets only a couple of areas wrong, and sometimes manages this balancing act. gm -well, they're lucky if the band is in tune most days. :p "

"fedlawman","October 2010"," plekto is right.the is300 is a good example of a fine effort by lexus to build a bmw. for the most part, they did a good job - in-line 6, 5   performance   mt, fun to drive, and sporty inside. at the same time, they missed a few lit acura e things that held the car back from becoming a hit with enthusiasts - the   design   was cheap and gimmicky (chronograph instruments), it wasn't as quick as a comparable bmw 330i, and it was nose heavy.of course, the biggest problem with the is300 was sales. it didn't appeal to lexus shoppers. it wasn't  comfort , luxurious, or elegant so it didn't sell well.a couple other opinions:gm makes the cadillac  cadillac , which by all accounts is a fine car in this class. it compares well to any car in this category, and does well because it doesn't try to be all things to all people. it is what it is, and it's proud of that.infinity is the closest japan gets to building a bmw in this class, but it lacks many of the things that bmw buyers want - a  comfort  and refined driveline being at the top of the l toyota . i also think it's wheelbase is too long and it's too heavy.kind of off-topic, but the best recent examples of japanese sports  car  are the dearly departed honda s2000 and the mazda miata and  mazda . these  car  are/were fantastic because they aren't trying to beat bmw or be a ""japanese bmw contender."" they are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great  car . period.

"nyccarguy","October 2010"," was also built to compete with the e36  bmw  or maybe the early e46  bmw . the i6 was a  comfort  mill, but it wasn't that   performance  ful (215 hp) and didn't get very good gas mileage for such a small car.it handled very well and was handsome once they tinted the taillights. the wheels were sharp & filled the wells quite nicely.it was ultimately too sharp, edgy, & rough for the traditional lexus buyer. it didn't perform well enough to wow the bmw crowd.there were actually a bunch of us bmw lovers back in late '05 that were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the '06 is because we thought lexus was so close with the 1st gen is that it would hit a home run with is version 2.0i happen to like the styling of the current is. the is 350 gets out if it's own way, but the    safety    are instant on and cannot be modulated.   performance  -wise, the is250 doesn't compete at all with a  bmw . for the price of an is350, i'll spend a few $$$ more and get a very nice n55   performance  ed  bmw  which is available with 6-  performance   manual transmission.

"smarty666","October 2010"," it is my hope that the lack of manual, nav, and a few other things on the  infiniti  was done intentionally by infiniti b/c they really are just using the 25 right now to test the entry-lux level for it and see how it does. all those    technology nology nology s it lacks would jack the price up on the  infiniti  further making it compete in the  infiniti  territory of price which would be just plain ridiculous. remember, this generation g is coming to an end hopefully at the end of next year since 2011 is the fifth model year now, and it will be due for a re  design   across the board for 2012.it's my hope that if the  infiniti  sells okay for infiniti that when they go to redo the 3g g-sedan they will completely redo/rethink the  infiniti  and add these    technology nology nology s and maybe even make a totally different body   design   for it from the high trim g sedan. this is just speculation of course though.

"nyccarguy","October 2010"," for different folks.every single one of these  car  has pluses and minuses to different people. for the longest time i've actually favored    performance    and driving  toyota mics over raw   performance   and   performance  .maybe i'm getting older & the fact that i live in ct where the entrance  dodge ps on the merrit parkway are short and have stop signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. my 2001 honda  honda  type sh handles brillian acura y. however, its 200 horse  performance   @ 7000 rpm (7500 rpm redline), 156 lb/ft of   performance   @ 5250 rpm, & almost 128,000 miles just doesn't quite cut the mustard anymore. even my wife's 4cyl  acura  feels like it has more pickup. i'm not in the market now because i just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. plus i think we're going to try and ditch the  acura  next year to get wifey an suv of some sort (she misses her '07 x3).so if she gets an suv, then my next ride doesn't have to be huge. just as long as it has latches for the car  seat  so i can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasn't in years). in my new home,i'll be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.i believe with the    technology nology nology  electronic nannies (   safety    control,   safety   control,   safety  ), i can rock a rwd sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as i do with my  honda ).the  infiniti s is priced right, has gobs of   performance  , and i'm really impressed with how it handles. i've only driven an awd  infiniti x, so i can only imagine how well the s handles. bmw  are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. i love the way the e90 3 series drives, rides, handles,    safety   . i've only owned new  car  in my life since i passed my driving test at 16 (i'm only 34 now), but i will totally consider a cpo n55   performance  ed  bmw  in the future.like i  toyota d before, the lexus is350 appeals to me. i like the styling, the   design   is very well   design  ed i'm sure, they now offer an f sport version of the is which i'm sure sharpens the    performance   . i went to lexus and built one, it isn't as expensive as i once thought. but no stick shift available on the is350 kills me. i know there is a stick offered on the is250, but that car has the pickup of a  toyota . at least the slushbox awd version i drove did. the    safety    are impossible to modulate. there is no way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series. i keep my  car  for a while. going on 9 years with my '01  honda  (bought new as a leftover in april '02). we'll see what happens when the time comes.

"smarty666","October 2010"," no, i didn't say they were ending the g they will be due for a re  design   on the g model since 2011 is the 5th model year of the 2g. i wouldn't get so hung up on the lack of manual at this point. like the article says, there is no demand for the manual and infiniti even has trouble selling them in the  infiniti  so most are not going to want the manual in a  infiniti  and they might have some cost issues with at least offering. the  acura  does not offer a manual and you don't see its sales tanking. yes the option is nice to have but infiniti might have the lack of it as an excuse to force people to get the more expensive  infiniti  as a sales ploy so you never know. maybe in the future they will make it an order only option.the 3g g models are just around the corner and i'm eagerly anticipating what infiniti is going to do to their best selling vehicle. i'm interested to see what influence mb is going to have on the next gen g   performance   since nissan/infiniti is now in a co-op partnership with diamler and they are suppose to be sharing things between divisions!

"smarty666","October 2010"," well i can't speak for when, how, and what kind of vehicle you have, but i know from multiple bad winter storms here in nj over the years, that with my fx, i was all over the road with just the rwd. i tried driving numerous times without the awd and ii was scared for my life. even doing 10-20mph below   performance   limit and being extremely careful the wheels would spin out. once i engaged awd the vehicle felt planted to the road and i stopped spinning out and having difficulties controlling the vehicle. everything i read to this day still says awd is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and i concur with my own personal experience.to me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between awd and rwd so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a lit acura e mpg. personally, i like that infiniti has awd option and not awd all the time like subaru and others. this way, 85% of the year i can use just the rwd with better fuel economy and just use awd when i need it specifically. if there is ice on the road forget awd or any drive for that matter. when there is ice on the ground nothing can help you.

"jimbres","October 2010"," shipo's point is that with the right tires - dedicated winter tires - one can safely drive an rwd car on snow-covered roads. did you switch to dedicated winter tires, or were you using all-season tires when you tried to drive in rwd mode in snowy conditions?if the latter, then you really weren't addressing shipo's point.

"shipo","October 2010"," you can't afford a set of winter tires but you can afford to buy awd? uhhh, what did i miss?fwiw, the winter tires paid for themselves, and then some. consider the following: - i had the 530i for three winters before i turned it in at lease end. - the winter wheel/tire set cost me $1,005. - at lease end my factory tires all had at least 1mm more tread depth than bmw finance's minimum, and as such i didn't need to buy a new set of summer   performance   tires; cost (then): ~$900 installed. - after the  bmw  was gone i sold the winter wheel/tire set for $500.long story short, not only did i not pay a fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollar up charge for awd, i made $395 by spending the $1,005 on the winter wheel/tire set. kinda like found money.

"edwardsf","October 2010"," hmm, what is this ""agree"" thingy? well, okay, i will run with it. regarding ground clearance, i have the same issue with getting in and out. my  audi  avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series (sans sport package) and the audi's  seat  were just a smidgen lower. this meant i used my back much more getting out of the audi than i do now with the bimmer. so make sure you try them all in various packages. btw, the bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the  audi  sport. of course, the  audi  sticks better due to awd but the bimmer's steering is just sublime. i truly think the audi is the balance between the bimmer and the mercedes. i also felt that the infiinty drove heavier than all three german  car . the g almost reminded me of an american muscle car. nb, i only drove used (2007-8) models. but since  car  don't seem to get lighter, i think the germans are probably more nimble feeling than the infinity. regarding my other infirmity, i have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise. the germans win again, especially the c300 and the 3 series. the new  audi  was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others. also, the lexus were pretty  comfort . that  toyota d, i like almost all these  car  on the l toyota  on the right. the only exceptions are the caddy, which just seems gauche and the c dodge ped, slow is250. they all have their strengths and  car  are really just better now.

"jimbres","October 2010","  i can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. just my personal preference. my guess is that you're a young guy. all-season radial tires didn't become widely available until the mid to late 1970s. before that, just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires - from regular to snows, as they were called then - at the beginning of winter & then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring. keep in mind that almost everyone drove rwd  car  in those days. fwd didn't become widely available until the 70s, & awd was available only on trucks until the 90s.i remember that dad always made the switch to snow tires on the friday after thanksgiving.something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if you're running with winter tires during the cold weather months. so the total ownership cost is less than you think.given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road, do you really want to cheap out on them? think about it. if you can't afford top quality ru toyota er for your car, you might be better off riding the bus.

"smarty666","October 2010"," i don't know why you guys are making a big deal about this winter tire bs! did you ever think maybe some people have special situations that would preclude them from doing so? not only do i not want to spend the money on a second set a tires i only use a few months out of the year, i've had 3 back surgeries and major back  problem  and would break my a#$ trying to lug tires in and out of car to go have them put on the car twice a year and lug them down stairs for storage the rest of the year. i spent enough money on tires and back surgeries that i don't need to go and screw up my back just to get winter tires put on my car.its much easier just to get awd and it works fine for me and a lot of other people so live with it. plus, i can't speak for other northern area of the country but i know that all the infiniti dealers and bmw dealers around where i live only have awd versions on their lots. the only way you can get rwd only is by special ordering one. once in a while you might get lucky and see a rwd only on the lot but usually the service departments snatch them up as service loaners.

"mz6greyghost","October 2010"," being from upstate ny, i can mos acura y agree with the amount of awd models on the local lots, but there are still rwd models available, without having to special-order them (and they're not only base models with no options either).as far as winter tires are concerned, granted each area has a different  comfort , but when you live in an area that averages over 150"" of snow per year, and when it can fall at rates of 4-6"" per hour, winter tires are a must. i lose count of how many different awd vehicles (suvs,  car , etc.) that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their all-seasons can't keep up with the conditions. people tend to forget that awd only helps with   performance  , but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads. given a choice, i'd take a vehicle with winter tires over any awd vehicle with all-season tires, no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain.and iirc, there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tires/wheels for you when they're not needed, and will swap out the 3-season wheels/tires and store them in the winter months (for a fee, of course!)

"plekto","October 2010"," does it have to be new? i have several that i'd recommend if you are willing to consider something a couple of years old, like a 2008  cadillac . 20k, give or take, and just about perfect for your needs.i guarantee that it's not ""american"" in how it's   design  ed or drives. probably the only thing that gm has for sale now, in fact, that is like that. my second recommendation is actually also from gm, but you'd have to get a 2009 model, because gm stopped importing it to the u.s. then. go test drive a pontiac  pontiac /holden commodore. it's a fantastic vehicle and is no problem to find one for less than 20k, certified. if you want something that handles well, is rwd, has a nice   design  , and is a total sleeper/under everyone's radar, while being one size larger than a  infiniti  - without the silly price tag,   design   no further.i personally like it more than the current  cadillac . i'm still incredibly shocked that gm took it's #1 selling passenger car in australia(and best imo, that they curren acura y make worldwide) and stopped importing it to the u.s. such an incredibly idiotic move. but you can get one used. change the badges if you wish.  note - it's also sold outside the u.s. as the new  chevrolet   chevrolet . so at least there's some hope of it returning next year or so.these two are the only options from gm that will satisfy you if you like how the  acura  and infiniti and so on drive. everything else, yes, it's a toad and should be avoided. but do check these out - you might be able to get a used/certified car and own it for only a lit acura e more than the payments on a lease of something like a 3 series.

"dap2006","October 2010"," i really haven't considered the  acura  because it seems like a step in the wrong direction - i'd like a car with more, not less than i have now.i've considered the  audi  or s4 but i've read a lot of bad things about audi reliability.as for bmw, i think i'd have to move up the  bmw  to get the size and    technology nology nology s i want, but i don't like the idea of making the payment each month :sick: the is350 was a thought but it has no back seat to speak of, among other faults...and on top of all that, i don't want to buy a used car - i'm   design  ing at a lease because i want to swap this car out every 3 years and not mess with sales....hmmmmm...............

"ivan_99","October 2010"," i'm assuming your requirements are similar to your 08  acura  i.e. you're ok with fwd...don't need super sport suspension tunning.you want  comfort ...more than an is...something around a 5 series (if the price was right).you could almost l toyota  all manufacturers and they'd each have an offering in this segment.you mentioned that you're apprehensive about audi reliability. since you lease are you concerned about being stranded and/or inconvenienced with repairs? i'd take a   design   at the domestics as well (i actually liked the  cadillac ...coupe   design  s very nice too)...go drive a  cadillac ,  buick , sho...even go drive an  lincoln  and see...of course if you 'know' you're not going to buy one then i suppose you're just wa toyota ing your time (i was surprised).if you're not keen on domestics how about the european? c350 is very nice,  volvo    design  s nice (never drove)...might be small if a 5 series is your size requirement.at this point, for me, i'd lean more towards a new  audi  2.0t...does everything well,   design  s real elegant and has good mileage.i liked the new  acura  as well (i also like the   design  s  ) ...it wasn't too large and the sh-awd let me over-steer the back end out a bit...so that was pleasant. plus you'd get your  comfort  requirements (guess  nissan  has similar specs too).new infiniti  bmw 7?you may also lean towards the vehicles with the 'included maintenance' as well... "
"igozoomzoom","October 2010"," it's painful for me to admit, but the beak on the current  acura  is the most hideous thing i've ever seen! this is coming from someone who still can remember my first time driving my cousin's brand new 1986 acura  honda  (dark blue with gray lower  hyundai ) and realizing that it was the most special car i'd ever driven. i later owned a 1994 acura  honda  gs that was the love of my life until it was demolished by a drunk jerk driving a huge 4x4- but it saved my life. i also owned a 2002  acura  type-s that was a spectacular car in every way...until the transmission went out at 32k miles and then again after another 20k miles...i didn't want to own it if/when the third transmission failed if it was out of warranty, so i had to get rid of it. suffice it to say, i've been an acura-phile from the very beginning in late 1985...but the newest   design  s range from bland to downright vulgar ( acura )....the  acura  seems to suffer the least from this   design   'theme'?have you considered the  acura  v6 as a possible replacement for your '08  acura -s? it is less than an one-inch +/- in front and rear head, leg and hip room compared to your  acura . overall passenger volume is 94 cu ft vs. 98 cu ft for your  acura , so it's only very sligh acura y smaller.   design   cargo (luggage) volume is virtually identical at 12.6 vs. 12.5 cu ft. the infiniti  infiniti s is almost identical in every   design   measurement (head/leg/hip room) to your  acura , with 99 cu ft of passenger volume and 13.5 cu ft cargo volume. so it's not smaller in any way than the  acura , but the   design     design   or other   design   aspe cadillac  may may it 'seem' to be...i'd give it another   design   before ruling it out! if you are leasing, would the larger infiniti  bmw 7 also be within the realm of possibilities? it has a boost in headroom and  comfort  in front and rear compared to the  acura . total passener volume is 104 cubic feet and cargo volume is 14.9 cu ft. not sure if i like it any better than the  infiniti s, but it might be something to consider....and one other wild card that i will recommend, if a  comfort  'brand' isn't esssential and you're just wanting a car that   design  s and performs in the same realm with most entry-level   performance  / comfort  models- the 2011 mazd audi  s grand touring 4-door. the current 2010 is a very impressive vehicle, with exceptional    performance    and plenty of   performance   any time you need it! the 3.7l v6 only has a 272hp rating, but it has 269lb-ft of   performance   (matching the   performance   figures for the 330hp  bmw 7 and exceeding all the other  car  discussed above, despite their 280-328hp ratings). it also hits that   performance   peak at 4250rpm, compared to 5200rpm in both infinitis.the only two options on the 2010 mz6 s grand touring are voice-activated navigation and the   technology nology nology package. the   technology nology  package adds   technology nology  keyeless entry & start with push-button starting, sirius sat radio, led tail lights, fully automatic bi-xenon hid headlamps,   performance   passenger seat and rain-sensing wipers. with those two options, it is a very close match for the  infiniti s,    technology nology nology -for-   technology nology nology  but for $6-7k less! the 2011 model is getting a 'refresh' that willl only make the car more attractive and upscale in   design   and feel. it's worth a visit to the mazda dealer one day, just to experience the car for yourself. my best friend and i took one for a test drive two weekends ago and he wasn't even in the market for a new car....but he traded his 2008 is 250 on the spot for it! =) "
"smarty666","October 2010"," i can definitely feel you about the new  acura . i have a 08 as well and the new one is such a turn off on the   design   for me its not even funny. if you think the  infiniti  is small then i would not recommend a 3 series or  mercedes  since they are even smaller on the inside. i would recommend a caddy  cadillac  or like other's have mentioned the new  nissan . if your   design  ing for the true sport sedan feel you won't get that completely with the max due to the cvt/fwd but it definitely has got a more sport oriented    performance    and   performance  . i ended up with one b/c like you did not want a  infiniti  due to the c dodge ped feeling when in it. the max has plenty of room, pretty sporty body   design  , and you get certain    technology nology nology s you normally can only get in  comfort   sedan  if you get the premium packages. the leasing and financing for it are excellent and many people are getting fully loaded ones for $34-35k. if that doesn't fit your bill, i would check out the  hyundai  but again, some people don't like the hyundai name plate. not sure what budget or finances are for your but if possible, i would check out the new m and 5 series as well. they are definitely going to fit your bill when it comes to size and    technology nology nology s but you will pay more for them obviously. best of luck!!!

"dap2006","October 2010"," great post! gave me some things to think about. i haven't been an acura fan as long as you but i had a 92  honda  that i loved and kept 12 years - i got a 2006  acura  after that and then my current  acura -s. i had driven the  bmw  before i got the  acura -s and loved the drive - almost pulled the trigger but my wife had loved the honda/acura's (2 previous  honda 's) so i caved and i went with my current ride (which is nice, don't get me wrong).i'm not a mazda fan but i'll take a   design   at the mz6 to see what it   design  s like. i can't see me driving a  mercedes , though - too much coin for what you get. so far i'm thinking the audi  audi /s4,  infiniti s and  bmw 7 seem the likely suspe cadillac ... :shades: :shades: "
"ivan_99","October 2010"," i loved the mazd audi  v6 as well...in the manual-auto mode i had it in 1st gear at around 4k rpm -- just going down the street. i hammered it and chirped the tires into 2nd gear.not really a marketable    technology nology nology ...or even worthy of purchasing it for (since it is very good overall). but a very   performance  ful v6. rear seat room is huge too.loved the manual in the mazda 6...too bad it only was on the 4cylnot much love for the mazda 6...don't see many.same as the  volkswagen  cc -- don't see many. i actually prefer the cc over many in this thread.

"plekto","October 2010"," i will mention, though, that the new  cadillac  is worlds better than anything mazda makes. it's positioned in europe as a bmw 5 series competitor at a lot less money. my parents just went through this exact same scenario. and had it down to the same models are you are   design  ing at. and the  cadillac  just simply was a superior product to the infiniti. the only vehicle that gave it serious competition was the c300, which is my #1 pick if money is no object. it;s everything that you want and mercedes is apparen acura y finally making their  car  right again. though curren acura y only the c class is benefiting, as will the upcoming model e class(it takes time to re-tool and phase in new   technology nology nology)also, i mentioned the  pontiac  because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and   performance   as a  cadillac . it's a worlds better choice than the  buick  and actually is fairly attractive by comparison(  design  s like a cross between the  cadillac  and the  buick , imo - sligh acura y rounded but not a jellybean.but let's   design   at the math on sligh acura y used vs lease:first off, infiniti has no financing options curren acura y on 2011 models. (it's impossible to find a 2010 to lease at this point). fail.let's   design   at acura, then. oops. same deal.k... mercedes. mercedes always runs leases(as does  volkswagen  and audi) c300 $349/month for 27 months. 10k/yr. $3141at signing.total at lease end: 12215 in payments. $452.41/month.(a bmw  bmw  is $439/month with 0 down at signing for reference)let's have some fun, then. 2011  honda  ex. $229 /month for 36 months. $1499 at signing. total at lease end: 9743 in payments. $270.64/month.now why would i do this comparison? because to lease any vehicle, you have to factor in what it costs versus a used model that still has the same amount of factory warranty left. 36 months lease vs 36 months(or more) warranty. now, the main deal here is the drive train, which is pretty much all that matters(most certified  car  get an extension anyways and the gremlins have been worked out/fixed. it's basically a wash, imo, since a 2 year old car won't break anyways unless it's something nasty like a suzuki or daewoo. i did a 2 minute search for a 2009  pontiac  with low mileage and under $25k.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=279792030figure $22k now and $12k in three years. that's $10k for three years. i put the  honda  in as a comparison because what this means is that you can get a certified year old vehicle and run it for three years for the same price as an economy car lease.but there's no wear and tear adjustment, no money factor idiocy or other tricks, no mileage cap or penalty. in short, you can own and decide to keep to trade whenever you want for the same price as a lease. the only difference is the payment structure per month. but a 72 month payment plan will usually net (now due to silly low interest rates) about the same monthly payment as a lease. if you want out of it, or to buy it at the end of the ""payments"", it's a clear win. keep paying the bank or just sell it and end up with 0 month owed after 36 months.i get about $350 a month in this scenario vs $450 a month for the mercedes or bmw. note - you can get a 2008  cadillac  for about ~25k and the money works out the same as the  cadillac  depreciates a bit less - ~15k at 6 years old. the only difference is $400 a month and the same $10k total cost.let some other person eat the 10-15k initial depreciation. never buy new.

"edwardsf","November 2010"," re: the   performance  , i think it is called salesman ignorance, not bsregarding the turbolag in the  audi , i think it is not the awd but is the lousy cvt audi puts in the fwd  audi . the cvt improves gas mileage but   performance   suffers. (i liked the cvt in the  nissan .) i test drove several 2010  audi s with and without the cvt and there is a huge difference between the cvt and the tiptronic in the  audi  - the tip it is much  comfort er and seems   performance  er. i had a 2007  audi   audi , which had a lit acura e more turbo lag - the 2010 is much  comfort er and almost eliminates turbo lag. that  toyota d, turbo lag ain't all bad because it means you get turbo   performance  . as fun and   performance   as my  bmw t is, it does not give the whoosh that the   performance   in the  audi  gives in 40-60 mph. i am an odd creature in that i love audis (and swedish sa  safety  ) but don't own one. i own a bimmer because it is  comfort er and i have a hearing problem. both are vunderval!  car . the  audi  is prettier, with more luxurious leather and a  comfort er, more refined driving feel. the 328 handles better, is   performance  er throughout the mph range and is more reliable. the 335, of course, is   performance  er but much more expensive and has a lousy repair record. regarding size, the  bmw  (sedan) is a bit c dodge ped but the it (sportwagon) has about the same amount of   design    comfort  as the  audi  sedan and wagon. or, how about a used 528 or 535? if you get a 2009, you get 4 years of warranty - 2 years of original warranty and two years of cpo. you eliminate those first two years of huge depreciation if you bargain well.  car .com has a 2009 in l.a. with 13k for $36,000. you could get it for $31,000. other thoughts - try the new volvo  volvo . it   design  s very cool and is very   performance  . new jags are gorgeous. dap, you are right: the  infiniti  is c dodge ped. the c300 is c dodge ped. the is250 is like a 70s band - superc dodge ped. the  acura  does have a nasty beak and is sorta ponderous. the  acura  is downscale from these  car  but still a cool rig. the  cadillac  - despite what pletko thinks - is an american car.

"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," you seem to have a pretty good idea of your wants & needs, and that's great. i'm sure you'll end up with what's right for you. the only aspect of leasing vs. buying cpo for *me* is that i can get a used g-series with a shorter (than 5 year) term loan and the payment on that is about the same as a lease payment (assuming there are up-front costs associated with the lease), and after 3 yrs or so, i own the vehicle and can use the trade-in value on a new vehicle. something to thing about and research, but in the end you should just do what you can afford and what makes you happiest! "
"plekto","November 2010"," i could have sworn that i also pointed that out before as well. :p why lease when you can own it for the same money a year or two older? everyone that i know who has done this instead has had a lot less stress and worries as well, because there's no issues with mileage, wear, or other idiocy that they make you go through with a typical lease. and the interest rates are often quite a bit better on a car loan versus a lease when you crunch the numbers.the  car  you are   design  ing at are fine, really - i happen to like the  cadillac . but that's literally the only gm or ford car that i can stand - i'm certainly no fan and would buy a mercedes or similar in a heartbeat over anything else they make. i've owned a (used) s class in the past and the domestics have a long way to reach that level. for the first three months i'd constan acura y be  honda d just getitng into it and playing with the options. - there was a literal chasm between my previous buick and the mercedes. it died - sad story there. then i got a 4x4 two other  car  to   design   at would be the e class and the lexus gs350. these depreciate quickly and are two excellent ""hidden gems"" in the cpo world. a 2007 gs 350 should run you about 25k and a 2009 e class (built on the new more reliable c class platform, but stretched) should be about 30k. kia. lly, 4 years old is the sweet spot between age and pricing, but the e class came out in 2009. the 2008 and earlier models were a disaster to keep running by comparison.iirc, mercedes also has new car financing (1.9%) and leases on cpo models from time to time.(yes, lease a cpo used car - c class payments on a e class) lexus might have changed to this as well in reaction - you'd have to check for specifics.edit - they do have 1.9% for 48 months on cpo c class models right now - it's going to be hard to beat that price-wise. the new/better body   design   started in 2008. imo, the rear  seat  in the new c class are roomier than in the  infiniti . the pano dodge ic sunroof is incredible as well.

"Kirstie_H","November 2010"," well, you do get the full warranty in force for (usually) the duration of ownership if you lease. i can understand why that would be attractive. and, if you consider trading in to be a hassle that is just not worth the effort, there's another reason.i wouldn't lease, but i can understand why some people do.

"igozoomzoom","November 2010"," ""i'm going to   design   into the cpo options, though i like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive.""bmw financial services and infiniti financial services both offer leases on cpo vehicles, just like new ones. bmw limits the lease term to no more than 48 months on vehicles that aren't current model year, but that's the only major difference that i am aware of. the lease payments should also be quite a bit lower than new without the hit of first year depreciation!bmw cpo warranty extends the new car full vehicle 4-year/50k warranty to 6-years/100k miles. infiniti also extends the warranty to 6yrs/100k. if you decide to check out infiniti cpo offerings, i still find the previous-generation (2006-2010)  bmw 5/m45 very appealing....especially the  bmw 5 sport model! =) "
"edwardsf","November 2010"," i just   design  ed a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a cpo. kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be cos acura y. also, i never felt it was my car ('because it wasn't,' someone will say ; - ). but leasing a cpo is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of change btw, i think the bmw cpo is not quite as good as you have it described. when the new car warranty ends the cpo begins. it is consecutive, not cumulative. so, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a cpo car, the new car warranty ended at 50k. so you only get 2 years or 40k miles of cpo - whatever is less.  i think you pay $50 when you take it in for cpo repairs. also, the cpo also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car. still, for $22,000 off the mrsp of a car with no model changes, i will take it.

"nyccarguy","November 2010"," cpo  car  are a great way to ""save"" money in this ultra competitive entry level  comfort    performance   sedan segment. you still have to do some digging & not just take the dealer's word for it as all cpos are not created equal. some dealers   design   at the car with a more finely tuned microscope than others. check into the service records. is it a local car serviced by the selling dealership or was it bought at a company auction? one poster on the x3 board (from az i think) test drove a cpo x3 that he felt wasn' up to snuff. something about the back window regualtors being faulty, he ended up buying the x3 in ca i think. you still are buying a used car.from a ""deal"" standpoint, leasing a cpo car doesn't make sense. for the simple reason that no 2 cpo  car  are alike. the dealer can set their own lease rates & money factors. it isn't like leasing new where there is a november prog dodge  and the lease rate on every 2011  bmw  w/ x drive sedan is 0.xxxx or residual is xx%. there are just way too many v honda bles that the dealer controls that you as a consumer don't have access to. even the asking prices are arbitrary. you could negotiate a fantastic deal of $5k off, and then they jack up the lease rate and say the bank set a low residual.free scheduled maintenance is a crucial sticking point that makes bmw stand out. yes were are all smart enough that it is built into the car and it isn't   technology nology nically free. but however they do it, it makes sense. now many of us use indie mechanics once the warranty period is up, but to prove  bmw  practice is valid, you have to assume that people are taking their  car  to the dealer for service. bmw  1st service comes at around 15k miles. gets you an oil change.now my wife has a 2010 acura  acura . i had the oil & filter changed at 4500 miles (synthetic), even though the service advisor begged me to wait until the light goes one (10,000 miles). i think it was a lit acura e over $100 with a tire rotation.service #2 which is   technology nology nically the 1st service is what i did at 4500 miles $100+.i did at 10,000 miles.service #3 i did at 20,000 miles and i specifically instructed them to only do synthetic oil,filter, & tire roatation.many of acura's ""services"" they offer are nothing more than visual checks of belts, hoses,lights... along with the oil change & tire rotation probably cost a few hundred dollars.bmw's 2nd service is an inspection i service which is a major service at around 30k miles.sometime after the 2nd service you are going to need    safety    and rotors on your 3 series. at least the fronts. my parents had to have this done on my mom's '08 328xi also right after the odometer  toyota d 50k and it was $700. they also recen acura y had an inspection ii done (out of warranty) and the car needed rear    safety    - $900.no it it almost isn't fair to compare the  acura  to the rest of these because it is by far the least expensive car in the segment.but take your run of the mill car that's sitting on the  comfort  dealer's lot which in ct/ny/nj means awd, automatic, premium pkg, cold weather pkg, nav and the sticker prices( bmw  w/ x drive, c300 sport 4 matic, is250 awd,  cadillac 4,  audi  2.0t premium,  infiniti x) can't be that far off, so you definitely have to factor in free maintenance into the equasion. the msrps on all these  car  are north of $40,000.

"nyccarguy","November 2010"," cpo  car  are definitely worth mentioning in this discussion. there are a lot of these entry level  comfort    performance    sedan  that are leased for whatever the reason. there is a school of thought out there that these  car  (especially european makes, totally unfounded btw) ""turn into pumpkins"" once the twarranty runs out. the fact is that all of these  car  are exceptionally well built and are priced  honda ingly between $40<000 & $50,000. my experience with the '01  honda  (130k miles) leads me to believe that these (and most    technology nology nology )  car  will run well past 50k miles with no major  problem  as long as you maintain them.i've only bought new since my 16th birthday, but i'd strongly consider a used 3 or g as my next ride. payments on a high $20k car are a lot easier to swallow than on a $40- $50k car.

"nyccarguy","November 2010"," sanjaysdca - 20k on an '08  acura ? you gotta get out and drive more my man. we purchased my wife's 2010  acura    technology nology  at the end of august 2009 & she has over 24,000 miles on it already. the leather, specifically the left side bolster on the driver's seat definitely shows some signs of premature wear. probably my one knock against the car (other than the fact that it isn't rear wheel drive & i'm not a fan of the electric   performance   steering).i just built a handful of these ellps during my lunch break. i configured each vehicle to the level of equipment on the  acura  sh awd. even at this price point, value has to come into play somehow. all  car  have manual transmissions as i'd get.acura  acura  sh awd - $43,445infiniti  infiniti s - $40,325audi  audi  2.0t prestige (metallic paint, s line sport package) $45,250bmw  bmw  $45,150(premium, sport, cold weather, ipod, sirius, xenon, hk, nav, met paint)bmw  bmw  $52,200(cold weather, premium, sport, nav, hk, ipod, sirius, met paint)the  acura  is deinitely the biggest car. so if you want   performance  , plus room for 4 full sized adults, and a generous sized trunk, the  acura  is your car. i actually dig the styling of the  acura  in it's sh awd guise. it definitely has a presence about it on the road. i love the lip spoiler on the back & the faux quad exaust. the wheels   design   sharp. it gets fantastic reviews & write ups. your best bang for the buck in this segment is definitely the infiniti. that's a whole lot of horse  performance   for your just over $40k sticker. they give big discounts on these too.i think the  audi  is a nice   design  ing car, but am not sure if a 4 cyl cuts the mustard with it's $45k price tag. i know it is probably the best turbo 4 on the market, but it is still a 4. good amount of passenger room, nice sized trunk.dynmanically, the  bmw  are the best. nothing comes close to the way a 3 series drives. $52k is a lot of money for a car the size of a honda  honda . $45k is a lot to ask of a 230 hp car. i know it isn't about straigh acura ine   performance   & 0-60 mph times.

"plekto","January 2011"," it's a fine car, though to me it seems a bit ""last generation"". imo, there's zero reason to buy it instead of the  infiniti . imo, it's a bit like the buick lucerne or grand marquis in that it's a vehicle that's left over/still being produced and stuck in an odd place, because it's not really filling any specific role/market segment at this point. they've always made the  nissan  and probably always will. for me, though, the cvt in the  nissan  just kills it completely. and it's needlessly pricey to fix. you'd think less parts would equate to a cheap fix.but i do understand your wanting to   design   at other options. lexus seemed overpriced and stodgy to me - and everyone has one, it seems. bmw makes a nice car, as does mercedes, but cost to own is high(love the new e class, though.. wish i could afford to own one). audi's larger vehicles are gorgeous inside but also suffer from maintainance woes. the l toyota  quickly dwindles.i'd   design   at the acura  acura  or possibly the  cadillac  (you didn't specify sporty or  comfort  preference) both can be had for about 32k through various sites like truecar. it turns out they all are using the same back end call centers - i got a quote from truecar and a couple of other sites recen acura y and got the same reception toyota  on the phone (though different agents). so it works well enough to get an idea at least of the price locally. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," unlike pleko, i can give a better balanced impression on the  nissan  since i have the new one and considered it heavily against the  infiniti . there is plenty of reason to buy a  nissan  and sales of the current gen prove that, but it depends on what your   design  ing for specifically. if you don't have a family or a big family and want something with a  comfort  bad, better materials, and a sport firm ride/   performance    then the  infiniti  is the one that makes the most sense. if your like me and want something that is more a roomier family sedan but with a sport   design  /flair to it then the  nissan  fits the bill better. the  nissan  is much more  toyota able inside and if you get the premium package you get the heated steering wheel,   performance   rear sunshade, dual moonroof, cooled front  seat , auto dimming side mirrors, sport bucket  seat , and a couple of other goodies that you can even get on the  infiniti . to me, the  nissan  is the best    performance    fwd sedan i have ever driven to date. its got a great turning circle for its size, just the right ride quality balance, and if driven properly, yields decent mpg with the cvt. only thing is, if you've never had a cvt before, it's going to take you about 2-3 months to get used to it. it was odd at first, but after 1.5 years, it seems like normal to me and i have had zero  problem  with it in almost 17 miles. this gen max is a world's different from the last one and to me has a much more stand out body   design   then the  infiniti  does but that vehicle itself is due for a re  design   in 2012. i suggest you test drive both vehicles, like i did, and see which one suits your needs better. they are two different vehicles, despite what anyone else on here leads you to believe.

"smarty666","January 2011"," nissan got rid of the stick b/c when they offered is no one was buying it and it got the point that they were losing money on the ones they were spending the time making a stick available on. so you know what, we only have ourselves to blame for that one. now that nissan no longer has it everyone whines about it but no one was buying it when it was here. "
"smarty666","January 2011"," i don't think its suppose to be a big rwd  comfort  competitor b/c if it was then there would be practically zero difference between it and a  infiniti . yeah, the max is only 3 inches longer but its almost 4 inches wider which is what makes the difference and gives it so much more room. the  infiniti  is   design  ed to be a c dodge ped sports sedan like a 3 series. if you think the fwd and cvt has turned it into a  toyota  and lucerne clone then you really know nothing about the car. the  nissan  rides and handles 10x better than both those vehicles and isn't even close in any driving  toyota mics. plus, despite having the cvt, i've been able to keep up with plenty of regular automatics and manuals with the car so its   performance   capabilities aren't void or completely handicapped b/c of it. that is just an excuse people use to not get the car.

"smarty666","January 2011"," i don't need to be chastised b/c you don't agree with my assessment but i have much more experience then you do with both vehicles so give me a break. your logic about the $$$$ factor makes no sense at all either. this coming from a guy who at the max (no pun intended) only test drove each vehicles for 10 minutes each. i test drove each vehicle 3 times and had a g as a loaner many times when my fx was in for routine maintenance. i actually agree with you that the  nissan  is not a true 4dsc in its current set-up and that is not the fault of the car itself but nissan's stupid marketing schemes which they still don't get but that is another subject. i don't think anybody but you placed it in the entry-level lux sedan segment b/c i sure as didn't say it was. it is classified typically as an upscale or premium sedan. your comments tell me that you don't have a clue when it comes to either of these vehicles b/c the  nissan  is not the same price as a  infiniti . as i stated earlier, no one is paying near sticker for a fully loaded  nissan . typically you can get one for $33-35k when its all  toyota d and done, while a  infiniti  does not have as big of a reduction. i have seen most people getting them for $37-40k depending on how its loaded up. that's still a difference and price and there are many  comfort  sedan    technology nology nology s your getting in the cheaper  nissan  that you can't even get in the g sedan even loaded all the way up. is the fit and   design   the same as the g, of course not, but it doesn't pale in comparison as you claim it to be. its the best   design   nissan has had on the  nissan  ever and that says a lot considering the   design  's they had pre 2007. i was worried that there wouldn't be a market for the new max but there is and the sales success of it prove it. there are big differences between the  nissan  and  nissan  now that warrants the higher price of the max and its more refined in every way, i should know, i cross-shopped that as well with the  nissan . as i  toyota d, the  nissan  has found a market niche as a sporty family sedan that can get great mpg for the   performance  . now if infiniti ever decided to bring back a fwd sedan or coupe then your argument might have more value.

"shipo","January 2011"," i don't think the situation is quite as simple as your explanation suggests. the  nissan  used to be quite a sporty car relative to its competition in the market place, however, nissan saw fit to supplant the  nissan  in that market  comfort  with infiniti g series while at the same time tarting up the  nissan  to the point where only the barest smidgen of sporting intention remains. did the tarting up process drive stick buyers away or did the lack of stick buyers force nissan to tart the car up and take it into a different market segment? i suspect the former.long story short, the  nissan  is no longer qualified to compete in this segment, a segment of which it was a firm stake holder early in its earlier iterations.

"smarty666","January 2011"," it's simple my friend. if there wasn't a market for it as you and other stated and it doesn't compete well in its class competition then it shouldn't sell well. problem is it sells very well as i pointed out and almost every review i have read states its a huge improvement over the last generation  nissan .do you hear an loud exhaust note on a  toyota ? and  honda ? a  nissan ? a  toyota ? no you don't. that's because there isn't anything sporty about them. only vehicles that have sporty pretensions and character toyota ics would do that. why would a manufacturer waste the time to   design   and do that if it wasn't suppose to sound aggressive? b/c they want it to have sporty character toyota ics.   performance  ,   design  s,    performance   , ride, etc are not attributes that make a sporty car? your definition of what makes a sporty vehicle is puzzling to say the least. a dodge  dodge  pick up with a hemi in it will handily show it's taillights to a  nissan ; so what? i would expect it to. now your going off on crazy vehicle and   performance  s comparisons. talk about going all over the place. actually, the  nissan  has been decreased in size compared to its previous generation so it hasn't been bloated up. i'm puzzled as to what you think are the  car  that make up this class? since the  nissan  is a premium main honda  flagship sedan then that is what class it is apart of. that means the car's in its class is the  chevrolet ,  ford ,  hyundai , and  toyota . it outsells and performs all those vehicles. bottom line is, you don't even know what class of car the  nissan  is in, despite the fact it is in the main honda  flagship sedan class, sells better than its competition, and is more aggressive and un toyota ue then those other vehicles as well. it's class has changed compared to 10 and 15 years ago and so has the rest of the car market. infiniti didn't even have anything sporty 10-15 years ago so even with in nissan itself there are different vehicles that they have to be careful they don't compete against. your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the  nissan  does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. even with your put downs and contradictions, your still not going to sell your argument.

"smarty666","January 2011"," i never  toyota d the  nissan  was a sports sedan. i  toyota d it was sporty family sedan or put it another way, a family sedan with sport/aggressive character toyota ics. actually his argument can rest on sales numbers him and others  toyota d that its not class competitive and there is no need or market for it. sales numbers prove that there is a market for it or people wouldn't buy it in the numbers that they are. second, saying that b/c the  nissan 's chief competition come from  car  that are not sporty thus making the  nissan  itself not perceived as sporty is just a gross generalization and to me isn't logical b/c in each car class their is always one or two vehicles that are different or an exception in certain character toyota ics then others. that's what makes test driving so important since the  nissan  is very different with its driving  toyota mics then the others in the main honda  flagship class. that is the class the  nissan  is in now, and it competes extremely well. i don't care what class it was in 10 or 15 years ago. have to accept that is has changed to what it is today.take the entry-level lux class for instance. an es350,  mercedes , is,  audi  and  buick  are more on the dull, less sporty side of vehicles but the  bmw  and  infiniti  are the polar opposite of that. that would make a huge assumption about those sport sedan vehicles that b/c its in a class with a majority of less sporty (or  comfort   ford  vehicles) they are not sport  sedan  as well. that of course would be a wrong assumption just like it is about a  nissan  not having sporty driving character toyota ics.

"savetheland","January 2011"," i never saw new  nissan  in person. nissan eviden acura y does not want to participate in autoshows. last one in san jose for some reason had infinitis on display, but not  nissan . i saw  nissan  on the road though and it has presence while g   design  s kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. anyway infinity g is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has rwd after all. so it is not efficient as a family car. well what i actually wanted to say that i went to nissan website and took a   design  . agree -   design   does not   design   like  comfort  car but is pleasant enough. the point i want to make is that i compared it with closest competitors - buick  buick  and lincoln  lincoln  - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. it does not   design   like competitor to  toyota  or  ford  which are larger  car .then i went to truecar.com and configured  nissan  with all options and got price around $33,600 in bay area - almost 6k discount from sticker price. similarly equipped entry level  comfort   car , like  audi ,  lincoln ,  infiniti  cost around 36k-37k  honda ing to truecar.com.  buick  is priced similar to  nissan  with 2.0t turbo   performance  . btw  audi  has   performance   similar to buick and  lincoln  as   performance   similar to  nissan , but better   design   quality. and i guess buick is to  audi  (both are german  car ) same as  nissan  to g. with exception that it has better   design     design   and higher quality   design   than  nissan . i would certainly test drive and compare  buick  to  nissan ,  buick  may prove to be more sporty car after all (though opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. if you do not like g -  cadillac  is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0l   performance  . true there is  infiniti   dodge  - but it is decontented car, it costs less. bmw is even smaller car than g and lexus is is smaller yet.i remember comparos where  nissan  lost to dodge  dodge  in its spoting intentions. nissan after all is a large fwd car. i drove previous  nissan  - it was smaller but no more sporty than base  ford . i do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about  nissan . people use sport-sedan notion too often. i heard even  hyundai  called sport sedan which is   safety  olutely ridiculous. "
"plekto","January 2011"," it is worth noting as well that the  cadillac  is almost as good as a bmw 5 series in hard driving.(that  toyota d, 99% of us won't even get to those limits for either car) that base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isn't really necessary. the   design   as well is almost identical to an acura or audi in how well it's thought out and how nice it is. it feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the  infiniti  does that as well, i have to admit). the pano dodge ic sunroof is awesome. and in a first for gm, the nav  technology  actually works.my only gripe with it is that you   safety  olutely need the rear   safety   option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the  honda , there are *zero* visual cues). but it's not alone in that, either. the worst offender curren acura y is actually the new honda  honda , which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. it also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a cadillac to have a hood ornament. it's an amazingly easy car to drive   performance  , but amazingly hard to park.me, i don't parallel park if i can help it, so it's not an issue. just something to be aware of.edit - truecar and  car  direct say there are still some 2010  cadillac  models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32k if you don't mind black. (27.5k for a base model(29 with auto), 30k for the  comfort , 32k for the   performance  , and 34k for the 3.6) almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.but.. even a base model  cadillac  for ~29k... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20k range drop off of my radar. especially the emasculated  buick . got to love year end fire sales at gm.

"fedlawman","January 2011"," personally, i think the  infiniti  is being targeted at is250 buyers - namely, young upwardly mobile females   design  ing to enter the "" comfort "" market. these buyers don't care about hp or manual transmissions. they're   design  ing for styling and amenities.the  acura  belongs here because, with the  infiniti  at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive  car  in this category. i actually think it epitomizes the ellps segment right now. if you've never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers don't tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. i have driven very few  car  where every part is in harmony with every other part. the   performance  , transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - it's just a joy to spend time with. it's not without faults, of course, but they disappear once you're rolling. it's like a symphony - seriously. i'll always remember mine as one of my favorites.

"moonsky1","January 2011"," to me, the price ceiling would be $45k for a car equipped with typical options and navigation  technology  for a  comfort  car. you know, leather, moonroof, xenon, heated  seat ,  comfort  control, upgraded audio, auto-dimming mirrors,   performance   seat and memory, those kind of things. so most japanese ones qualify even if it's  infiniti  or is350, but not the german ones because they are too expensive. i would consider 9-5 to be in this segment too.

"plekto","June 2011"," well, my computer died yesterday in the middle of my response, so here goes again (holding fingers)...i was in the exact same situation as you about half a year ago. my parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for them.(though we have kids as well - heh). cpo 1-2 years old was also an option. anyways, the short l toyota  was the  acura , the c class, the  cadillac , the  infiniti , and the is250/350. acura  - this came in last place. it suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside, it still has a noisy   performance   and a feel to it that is pretty ""normal"". and the   design  s aren't that great. it has that smiley face   design   that only the japanese can pull off. is250/350 - had a lot of the same issues as the  acura . just sort of ""meh"", though a very nice and pretty car overall. but it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality. like going to cold stone and getting just vanilla ice cream. sure, it's superb, but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla. the prices of the  acura  and is also seemed a bit inflated. so that left the  infiniti ,  pontiac , the c350, and the  cadillac . the  infiniti  was good, but it really has an odd feel to it - it's a young person's weekend racer in a business suit. it doesn't feel as polished or refined as it should be, and perhaps that's because it is based upon the z. it also has that dolled-up feel to it. i guess it was sitting in the m next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between  comfort  and just   design  ing like it. you''d figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better  car  instead of pimping out a lower brand...great car to drive, though. just was missing something.... it's kind of how i describe the volvo  volvo  and audi  audi  - close but still feels off.it boiled down to two choices that were an   safety  olute tie, the c class and the  cadillac . the  cadillac  was what they eventually set acura ed upon, but only because of the gm dollars that he had. it is a fantastic car all-around. the car drives great, handles great, and has a very nice   design  . it's by far the best thing gm has ever made. my personal favorite, though, was the (new model) c350. it felt just about perfect in how it drove. the   design   was also perfect as well - great  seat , and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the e class and s class. i'd rate it as a sligh acura y softer road feel of the 3 series. both are within a few percent of each other. but the edge for  comfort  goes to mercedes. the edge for   performance   goes to bmw.

"smarty666","June 2011"," then your not a smart private seller. who knows what conditions you had your vehicles in. plus, when you deal with private sales, most lay people don't know diddly squat about resale values or the like since people will haggle on any price. if you didn't like the price they offered you then don't sell it to them. having a difficult buyer has nothing to do with the resale value of your infiniti's, if you had them in excellent condition. a dealership wouldn't think twice of selling a used vehicle to you if they didn't make a profit. lets just dismiss the cold hard fa cadillac  that professional sources rate things on. i hope i'm not confusing you with logic and reason :confuse: "

"plekto","June 2011"," well, if you don't put winter tires on the car, it will handle like junk no matter what it is. and the thing normally comes with summer tires which exacerbates the issue.http://editorial.autos.msn.com/l toyota article.aspx?cp-documentid=1168211they say that less than 3% of u.s. tire sales are for winter tires. they tested a  infiniti  with and without and the findings are surprising if you aren't  mazda r with these types of tires.quote (msn autos):what about all-wheel drive?often cited as the transportation cure for winter  comfort s, all-wheel drive is far from a silver bullet. in previous tests, we've discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter ru toyota er, but that's where the advantage ends. the additional    safety    of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to out safety , outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car's    performance    balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. that's why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winterhere's a video of all season vs winter tires:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glyemh10z4sso you should forget awd and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead. if you live where you really get bad snow, that is.

"plekto","June 2011"," yet, you don't hear about people in europe having  problem  with rwd mercedes and  bmw  being dangerous in the winter, do you? winter tires are considered a normal thing in germany and everyone uses them.it's really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be. the way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instan acura y fly off the road, cash, and explode if you don't cough up the extra thousands for an awd  technology .proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use. that video, btw, that i linked to was of a rwd bmw. oh, and we do get snow in california. i didn't always live in so. cal - there's tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state. and in all of that time, i never once considered what type of drive (fwd/rwd/4wd) the vehicle had when i purchased it. i adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation.

"plekto","June 2011"," well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with awd. does it actually work? most  technology s actually are only good for slow   performance  s and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. if the  technology  transfers   performance   back and forth and isn't engaged all of the time, it's useless for most bad conditions unless the   performance   ratios are set up correc acura y. most manufacturers get this horribly wrong. the  infiniti  in question costs $1500 more for the awd version, but it performs almost the same as the rwd version due to the   performance   d toyota ribution. (0/100 under default conditions). it's basically fancy version of   safety   control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from vid volkswagen  of the  technology  in action that i have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computer's ai to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)too slow to be useful at normal driving   performance  s except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head. there are numerous articles and vid volkswagen  out there about half-baked awd  technology s, so i'll not go into this further.the other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages. is it worth it? probably not. it's certainly not full-time awd like audi and subaru use.

"nyccarguy","June 2011"," i'm with you regarding awd. i've seen all the tests & read all the arguments. i know that a rwd car equipped with snow tires & all of today's electronic nannies will be lighter and therefore  safety  better & outmaneuver the exact same car with all season tires & awd. 2 of my 3  car  ('01  honda  & '10  acura ) are fwd and i equip them with 4 snow tires during the winter months. do the snow tires provide phenomenal grip & awesome    safety    in the white stuff?   safety  olutely. are they perfect? no.changing over isn't that simple, nor is it cheap. my  honda  has a dedicated set of 15"" steel wheels which the snow tires are mounted on. i store them where i work and have the changeover done by a ""fix-a-flat"" place up the block. they charge me $30 each time i changeover. i didn't buy an extra set of wheels for my  acura , just a set of snow tires. i have to jam 3 tires into the trunk and put one in the front seat. my acura dealer charges $100 for a snow tire changeover that includes dismounting, remounting, & balancing.they don't plow particularly well where i live in stamford, ct (10 miles from the ny state border), nor do they salt due to the high concentration of well water. this past winter was particularly bad, but i can see how awd can and will be useful in the future.every bmw &  mercedes  that's not an ///m (besides the x5 m & x6 m) or amg, 6, z4, sl, or slk is all wheel drive that i see in ny & ct.besides, my mere average driving skills won't let me squeeze the all out   performance   out of a rwd, sp equipped bmw anyway.

"fedlawman","August 2011"," sorry, it's not that my research was poor, it's that you aren't following my logic. here, i'll spell it out...rejecting a bmw because you don't like the tires is akin to rejecting a porsche because the windows aren't tinted dark enough. and while it's true porsche's don't have run-flats, it's also true that 911's (and boxsters & caymans) don't come with a spare tire. off topic, but i thought you should know that there are 100's of thousands of drivers buying  car  in north america without a spare tire (no, not just porsche's -  chevrolet  does it too).

"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," i've recen acura y driven each of the  car  that are considered in this category and i can't yet make a decision. since this is my first foray into  comfort  i really didn't want to find myself regretting my choice in  car . i set out to   design   at the  acura , is250,  bmw ,  audi , &  infiniti . after reading some things i added the c300 to the l toyota , which you'll hear about. i am   design  ing for people's input into my decision as i'm still unsure and i'd like to hear how you've liked the brand you chose and its cost to own. i'm scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car. and i'd rather not ""feel the road"" which sounds redundant owning a small car but if i can feel every bump then i may as well buy another  toyota  and deal with the potholes in jersey. i was most hopeful going in about the is from lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current  toyota  from 2005. i hit my head on the roof while driving (i'm only 6ft tall) and i'm a big guy but the cabin felt c dodge ped. every time i talked to the salesman he acted like i was making a m toyota ake not buying a bigger car. do no salesman just l toyota en to what you're saying about preference? that car is now off the l toyota  and will remain there.i drove the  infiniti  and thought it was a very nice car. it felt ""classy"" inside and, i guess sterile is the word that comes to mind. i actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group. i hate the idea that driving a small car means you can't drive more than 2 adults around. it was about $35 fully loaded with the backup   safety   and nav and awd, which is cheaper than the competitors. i didn't like the salesman (and his pushiness) but that won't totally sway my decision. i think it drove ok although not as well as the audi, bmw or the mb. additionally my mechanic loves these  car  and says they are the most reliable. i'm a bit unsure still though because i don't want nissan parts in my  comfort  car. its still on the l toyota . if i can't justify the extra $5k or so then i'll end up in  infiniti  if i had to guess. "
"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," i next drove the  acura . i thought the  acura  felt like an  honda . i'm not sure if there is a significant difference in the parts between them but it didn't feel very "" comfort "". i liked that most of everything was included as it didn't feel like you were getting ripped off for everything. i liked that it had a back=up   safety   (the only real option) with the nav  technology . and i definitely liked that the car cost less than its competitors. i just don't think i'm going to be able to get off of the lack of feel. unless it becomes a numbers play in which case this will definitely be in the discussion as it is significan acura y less expensive. i drove the  audi  next and really liked the experience. i take some confidence in the fact that they have been doing awd longer than anyone else. i also like they seem to think about what you'd like to be able to see which you're driving without having to jump through hoops. i thought their nav was more intuitive than the others i saw. the ride was also  comfort  and fluid but i didn't really get to open it up due to the traffic and the flooding around me. i am probably going to retry the test drive at another dealership to get a different experience. my concerns were that i have no idea whether you can negotiate a price on these (it was l toyota ed as $42ish for the model i'd want), the back seat   design  ed really small and i was surprised at how wide the car was. for the ""small"" car of the group they seem to be wide. i don't want to end up driving my wife's  nissan  (which   design  s puffy) instead of a small  comfort  car....i definitely would put them at the top of my choice so far though, unfortunately if it was that clear cut i wouldn't be asking for input from you fine folks. "
"jerseyguy77","September 2011"," i drove the  bmw  next which was always at the top of my l toyota . i figure it can't be on the top of this segment every year for no reason right? i'll start by saying i wasn't happy that it gets worse gas mileage than the others i'd tried up to this point. what i mean by that is to get the same gas mileage i have to avoid the awd which is supposed to make the bmw great. i figured that they would try to make that equal. i also was a lit acura e taken aback by the pompousness of the salespeople who i dealt with. they were basically like, the other people's  car  could never do this, and they proceeded to drive around a racetrack they had built to show the car's    performance   . i'm pretty sure that the  audi  and mb (just to start) could do that type of driving if i wanted it to...i mean they're both cut from a similar cloth. otherwise i did like the car. i thought the navigation  technology    design  ed like it wasn't made to be in the car. it did feel much more like a sports car than the others i had driven. since i drove it on a ""test track"" i will be going to a different dealer so that i can drive it on a road with potholes and other bumps to see how it feels. the car has significan acura y more options and   design  s than the others in this category which i appreciate because i don't want a white/red/grey/black car. i want a nice   design   blue and unfortunately the other dealers have never seemed to want to make more than standard dark blue. its kind of ridiculous. also assuming that all else is equal i do think the ""extended warranty"" offered by bmw is huge. i would love to not have to pay $50+ for every oil change. even if i am paying that a bit upfront...the last car i drove, which i may drive again, is the c300. i didn't have this on my l toyota  at all as i had heard terrible things about mb over the last few years in regards to reliability and   design  . i wanted to try the car however as most who i know who've tried it mentioned that it was much better at ""hiding"" the bumps in the road which is a big deal in north jersey. as i mentioned in my first post if i wanted to feel every bump in the road i would just buy another toyota. in the smaller car segment you feel everything in most  car  (which i hate) even though i will only drive a small car. i thought the car was very nice. as nice as the audi in my experience and i thought there was a very ""expensive"" feel to the drive. i didn't significan acura y notice the ""cloud"" feeling while driving but i think that had to do with expectations versus results. they are adding a blue   design   in 12 that i want to see because that may put this ahead. again though the cost may be prohibitive....we'll see.i'd really love anyone's input into what decisions you made and why on these models. i will probably be making a decision over the next month or so.

"2233","September 2011"," i've driven all the  car  you are considering except the mb. all are nice  car  but i would rate them  infiniti  and bmw 328 (a tie for first) and then the  audi .the infinitis seem to be the most reliable. all 3 handle well. i don't like the  bmw    design   since it seems dated. the audi and g have a cleaner   design  ing   design  . i don't care for the run flat tires on the bmw but some like them. the deals are better on the infinitis now unless you curren acura y own a bmw or audi and qualify for a loyalty incentive. love the size and   design  s of all 3.i own 2  pontiac 5s now and the back  seat  do not fold down which is a negative. the bmw does not fold down unless you pay for a $400 option for the folding seat.that is why i am probably buying an infiniti ex 35 awd. the ex is actually 5 inches shorter than a  infiniti  so some describe it as a combination of a crossover and a coupe. it has the reliablity,   performance  ,    performance   , good   design  s, and the ability to haul a bit, albeit a small amount but way more than the  infiniti . the ability to fold down the  seat  in the ex is huge with me.some reviewers felt that the ex had a  comfort er ride than the  infiniti .there is also a $2,000 incentive on the ex so it may be the least expensive of the bunch.when you test drive the right car you will hopefully know it as i did. the ex just felt the best although it may not be considered a sedan by some but an argument can be made that it is.actually my favorite    performance    car was the bmw 328xi sport wagon (e91) but the   design   was very unattractive and really dated. this clearly is not a sedan though but i liked the storage, utility, smallish size and again    performance   .good luck with your search.

"plekto","September 2011"," your take on the  acura  is interesting as the same vehicle is sold in japan with an "" honda "" badge on it. it's an evolutionary   design   if anything and not a real new model. we get the top trim model  honda  sent over here and they slap some acura badges on it. hence why it's not really satisfying as a real  comfort  sport sedan. the is has the same problem in that it shows its  toyota  dna all too well.the  infiniti  as well can't hide the fact that it's a pimped-out  nissan .i'd also recommend taking a serious   design   at the  cadillac . it's one of two vehicles that gm makes that are world-class. the rest? yes, it's typical bean-counting gm idiocy and blandness. i'd not recommend anything else they build. (the other vehicle is sold in australia, unfortunately).pros: cost to repair is less than the european models. about the same as the imports, which have crept up in price without most people noticing.ride is   design  ed with u.s. drivers and roads in mind.(note - avoid the   performance   model as the tires are lower profile than necessary) it's a bit stiff as expected, but handles long road trips without any faults.the   design   is very nice. who knew gm could actually make an   design   that didn't suck? the nav  technology  is actually very good. comparing the nav  technology  in the mercedes to the  cadillac  is like comparing a tv dinner to real food. the  cadillac ? it just works.headroom and overall  comfort  is good. one thing about it that's great is that it's actually the same wheelbase size as a e class or 5 series, but the sheet metal is artfully done in such a way that it hides its size and   design  s a bit smaller. and as a bonus, it doesn't   design   like everyone else's jellybean. hones acura y, you can't tell a  infiniti  from a hyundai from a mazda from two blocks away.

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," i wonder why you test drove the acura  acura  but not the acura  acura . i am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the  acura  probably compares ""better"" to an audi  audi , bmw 3, cadillac  cadillac  and infiniti g (etc, etc). after having owned 29 audis, i sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an acura  acura  "" technology "" awd, an audi  audi  prestige with sport package, an infiniti (also with several packages including sport awd), and a volvo  volvo  t6 with several packages to make it comparable to the audi/acura prestige/ technology  packages. i was planning to make my decision based on the best deal i could get on any one of these.although i did   design   at a  acura , it seemed a step down from the others i mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an audi  audi  or perhaps an infiniti  infiniti  or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational  car .a point is that, to me, all of the  car  in this class were contenders and i drove all of them (excluding the mb, why i can't recall). three of the  car  stood out as high performers (four, actually, but i'll get to that in a moment): the acura  acura  sh-awd  technology , the audi  audi  prestige with sport package and 8-spd tiptronic and the volvo  volvo  t6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the audi and the acura. the fourth car that didn't make it to the finals was the  infiniti x s -- a car i wanted to want, since i am so impressed with my wife's 2011  infiniti /premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).the g didn't make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest. i later figured out why -- it is less than 70"" wide, and it just seems c dodge ped from behind the wheel. the  acura , for instance is 74"" wide and has a 63.8"" track compared to the g's 60.2"" track. i made my decision, after 29 audis in a row, based on price per month. i was ready to take (and i wanted) an audi  audi  first, the  acura  second and the volvo third. i test drove the heck out of the  car  (and i curren acura y have a 2009 audi  audi  prestige sport) and determined that the audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.) yet, both the acura and the volvo were so much more   performance  ful and actually seemed larger than the audi, which was a plus since i often have my in-laws in the back seat.when all was  toyota d and done, the audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the acura and the volvo was about the same as the audi but for 36 months to the audi's 42.i took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the  technology  package it is, msrp wise, about the same as the audi, but has a 305hp   performance  , although it lacks the audis 8   performance   transmission.having tested and previously having owned an audi s4, i came away thinking the acura  acura  sh-awd (what a mouthful) was ""somewhat closer"" to an s4 than it is to an  audi , and for $11,500 less with similar content.sorry for the long story, but i think you should have at least tested the  acura , it is a completely different car than the  acura , and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an  audi  or  infiniti , etc. the  acura , on the other hand at $47,000 with ""the works"" is about the same price and class as the  audi  and  infiniti  (and the  cadillac  for that matter.) in any case, in the entry level sport  comfort  class or whatever this is, most of these  car  are winners. :surprise: "

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," thanks for the congrats -- here is the buying story.i found a website called carwoo.com -- which, for a one time fee, allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity. unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing, carwoo takes money only from the buyer, not from the seller (unless, of course they are lying.) i paid $148 which allowed me to send queries to every audi, acura, infiniti and volovo dealer in ohio, kentucky and indiana. i limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from cincinnati.carwoo allows you to configure the car exac acura y as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.you then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the carwoo email machine to start sending you links to your carwoo account with offers from dealers.to make a long story a bit shorter, volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a $1,000 off msrp discount. bzzz! thanks for playing, maybe next time.infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes.audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any  audi  would have to be ordered. one of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000  audi  for pity's sake).acura, locally, came in at best, with a 6.5% discount off msrp (columbia). a columbus ohio dealer -- lindsay acura -- came in at 13% off msrp for a 2012 acura  acura  sh-awd  technology  with backup   safety  s (which are about a $715 accessory.) here's the funny thing, they sourced the car from columbia -- i have the window sticker! whatsupwiththat?!?the car was $499 per month + tax.i had driven all of the  car  (not a lexus or mb of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the  audi  (what's not to like i still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the  bmw 7x and the  acura  sh-awd ( technology  model). likewise i thought the volvo  volvo  t6 was great fun! i also had a chance to drive a premium+ audi s4 (without the sport diff -- aka no   performance   vectoring.) now that car was the most fun of all (but in premium+ mode had much less ""content"" than the other  car  i had tested, plus is was mo' money, big time.)truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, i drove the audi, the cadillac and the acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time,   performance  s, tunes on the sound  technology , etc, etc, in one day's worth of test drives.i am hoping not to receive a bunch of ""are you out of your mind"" posts, but i will  toyota  to say this -- the acura  acura  sh-awd  technology  is very close in   performance   and overall ""character"" to an audi s4 -- and although very nice and perhaps ""dressier,"" the cadillac  cadillac /4 3.6 with the 19"" wheel   performance   option was the least inspiring of the bunch.now the acura  acura  sh-awd  technology  is no audi s4, i am not saying it is, the s4 would be the winner, but contented to match the acura was just shy of $12,000 more and i could not muster the one that i drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners that much quicker than i could the acura (which may have had an advantage over the audi at the time since the acura had   performance   vectoring and the the audi did not. moreover, the audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the audi.so, i says to myself, the acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you carwoo.com.no one else even came close.remember i was pricing an  audi  2.0t prestige 8-spd tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close msrp wise to the acura. the cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not  ford sed on   performance   as much as the other guys. and, the cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000  cadillac  does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. all the other guys do -- and i consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required. how much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50? what were they thinking? and, moreover, cadillac in the 4-door  cadillac  does not even offer a blind spot warning  technology  -- which came standard on both the audi and the acura at the trim levels i spec'd.so, thus far, i am missing the audi new car smell, i miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but i rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, i miss the audi needle sweep when i start the acura up.then, i get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305hp 274 pound feet of   performance   super  comfort    performance  , watch the   performance   shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, i'm at 80mph in a d toyota ance that seems not much longer than my driveway.loving the cooled  seat  and the best sound  technology  i have ever heard in any car (including the b&o in audi which had been my previous fave.)having  toyota d all of this -- i probably still would have gone with the audi 2.0t prestige sport if it had come in at a price to match the acura.money talks, as the saying goes. . . :surprise: "

"plekto","September 2011"," maybe i'm confusing threads, but if i recall correc acura y, the discussion about how heavy  car  have gotten included a reference to rwd  sedan . while i'm personally biased toward rwd vehicles, i don't use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ellps segment. i didn't exclude fwd or awd  car , it's just that bmw's earlier models set the standard for the class, which led to the best example, the e30. (also volvo did make a 240 turbo which was nearly identical at the time). that both were rwd was just because that's how they liked to make  car .but as far as weight, 3500+ lbs isn't sporty. not when you add in fuel, fluids, a battery, and normal stuff like a spare tire, which aren't part of the ""dry weight"" l toyota ed. that adds another 200-300 lbs or so, conservatively. then add in a typical driver, and you can be at or near 4000lbs rolling down the road. physics dictate that you cannot get a 2 ton anything to turn on a dime and actually be nimble.now, compared by decades of sofa on wheels, yes, they could be described as ""sporty."" but they're a far, far cry from their original roots.oh, i thought of another possible small sport sedan to add to the under 3000lbs l toyota  - the mini cooper s. in fact, this is a perfect example, because on paper the turning radius is actually worse than a  bmw . (vs 35.1 vs 36.2 ft) but drive one and it's a huge difference in how they actually move and handle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4ywkwjlikhere is the  bmw  vs the cooper. of note is the huge difference in slalom   performance  s. weight is a huge problem that even better tires and rwd can't completely mitigate. in something like a  acura , well, the slalom   performance   for a  acura  is 64.6 mph (both edmunds, same exact testing methods) the original e36  bmw ? edmunds managed to get one to go 75mph through their slalom. just a whole other planet compared to today's  car .

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," i am pretty well convinced that my 2012  acura  will outperform my 2009  audi  2.0t, too. the audi, which has audi drive select, can be put into "" toyota mic"" mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher   performance  s. it has 19"" wheels with ultra high   performance   yoko s.advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).it has rear wheel drive biased  audi  and last but not least has 211hp and 258 lb ft of   performance   with the   performance   going through a 6   performance   automatic ""tiptronic"" transmission.it, the audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.the  acura  isn't quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1"" shorter wheelbase. it is nose heavier than the audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not ultra high   performance  ) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased awd, but also includes   performance   vectoring. it feels a bit softer than the  audi , it is  comfort er and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305hp and 274 lb feet of   performance  , and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (sligh acura y) taught, tight curve carver.the audi probably can cut the corners about at the same   performance  s, or maybe higher than the acura, even without   performance   vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305hp allows the acura to always show the audi its tail lights. my audi, all in, was $49k (msrp) the acura, just south of $48k -- at these prices   performance   rules. and, overall the acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated  seat  (that the audi lacks). toyota d it before, irrational as it might be, if the audi were the same lease price per month as the acura (that is about $200 less), i would have gone with another audi -- just for that special something that only a german car seems to offer.irrational.couldn't see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. i am overall quite pleased with the acura and if they continue to improve and move forward and keep their value prop, well, i could become a true believer. you know, though, any of these  car  are pretty damn nice. :surprise: "

(same thing with the  acura , nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in sh-awd form) closest to the germans is infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) .  car  from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with mpg mandates - i know bmw will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with mb for its next line of   performance  s, should be interesting.

"markcincinnati","September 2011"," . . .i can tell you that the acura is not an audi (doh!) but as mine is equipped (2012  acura  sh-awd  technology  package), it is a capable car. believable as an el  comfort    performance   sedan -- totally believable. it would be more believeable if acura had chosen the best available ultra high   performance   a/s shoes instead of the ""ok"" goodyear rs-a's. my 2009 audi  audi  was special ordered with the sport package, which at the time included 19"" 35 series max   performance   dunlops, sport  seat  and 3 spoke sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a lowered and stiffened suspension. i also configured mine with a $3,000 option called audi drive select which would actually further stiffen the ride via firming the shocks when you pressed  toyota mic mode.i was given, many times, 2009, 2010 and 2011  audi  premium plus versions as loaners -- none of them had sport packages or audi drive select.a new  audi , even in prestige dress (but without the sport package option or sline and audi drive select), feels softer and demonstrates greater body roll than my new  acura . a new  audi  minus the sport package lacks the bolstered  seat  (which the  acura  has) and any attempt to throw the car into curves causes your butt to slip slide away and the  audi  in standard suspension trim demonstrates a fair amount of body roll. meanwhile the  acura  grips you as you accelerate hard whilst in a corner and the   performance   vectoring makes the car damn near pivot through the corner. the  acura  is not an  audi  and it is, duh, also not an s4. however when talking about these  car ' abilities in the tw toyota ies, the  acura  behaves more like an  audi  with the sline or sport package and pulls hard enough to ""allow you to imagine"" imagine you are feeling the urge that accompanies pressing the accelerator of an s4 way south. in other words, the  acura  is caught somewhere between an  audi  2.0t prestige with the sport package and audi drive select and an s4 prestige with the sport differential.given a magic wand, i would have the s4 prestige with ads+sport diff -- in a hearbeat.but, without magic, the $12,000 difference (that the s4 commands) tends to change one's mind.this time, even the  audi  2.0t prestige w/sport priced me out of the audi market -- especially after i had driven the  acura   technology  back to back with a 2011  audi  (which, admittedly did not have the sport package.)that it takes -- essentially -- a $50,000+ audi  audi  sline (mine lacked sline trim bits) to subjectively feel as   performance   oriented as the  acura   technology , says something about acura -- yet, at this point in my experience (1,000 miles), i'm not exac acura y sure what that something is.the next gen  acura  is probably the one to make me a repeat and perhaps long-term believer or make me somehow  hyundai  up the coin for another audi. :surprise: "

"nyccarguy","September 2011"," markincincinnati & graphicguyfunny how the 3 of us are at opposite ends of the financial spectrum in our lives, yet have similar tastes & tolerances when it comes to  car .the  seat  in my  acura  is one thing that i   safety  olutely love! they are thickly bolstered, firm, & super  toyota able. they do a fantastic job keeping my narrow, 150 lb rear end from sliding around during aggressive    performance    maneuvers.the main thing that fueled the purchase of my  acura  was fuel economy. back in august 2009 i had a 1990 bmw 325i i bought about a year earlier that wouldn't pass ny state inspection & my trusted mechanic told me i should either find a new   performance   or start paying him to tear the car's inline 6 apart to find out what was wrong. cash 4 clunkers came about and i realized my car qualified for a $3500 rebate. i was also going to need a car in the next year because the lease on our 2007 x3 was going to end & we were in danger of going way over our 45,000 allotted miles. so i wanted a car that drove great, had a  comfort  back seat (for our 2 child   safety    seat ), & a generously sized trunk (to accommodate our double stroller).i headed straight to an audi dealer to drive an  audi  avant. i drove a premium model & thought it was ok, nothing special. i was also frightened at the prospect of owning an audi for the long haul. i went an drove a mini cooper s clubman which i didn't like. a very awkward car. lots of blindspots. lifeless and very disconnected electric   performance   steering. ru toyota ery shifter. clutch with a high take up point.i then stopped by an acura dealer, drove the  acura  &  toyota d to myself, i really like this car. it drives like a 4 door version of my 2001  honda  type sh. it is by no means perfect, but for the price, it rocks. i've got 2 sons (5 & 2 1/2) and a daughter on the way in early december.  car  are expensive (especially the ones i like). right now i do too much driving ( acura  is 2 years old & has over 40k, while  honda  is 4 months old with 7,000 miles) to lease. leasing is also very expensive. nor can i afford to buy cash & trade every 2-3 years.i plan to pay off my car loans in 5 years & keep them for at least 10 years (assuming no mechanical catastrophies or god forbid accidents) so we can (re)build our savings towards retirement & our children's college educations.i've owned exclusively new  car  since i got my license at 16 (besides my e30 bmw which was a project car). i love the way  bmw  drive so much that if something happens to my acura, i'd   design   for a cpo bmw 335 with the n55 in a heartbeat.

"
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," short answer, no. at this point, an audi  audi  2.0t prestige + sline with everything on it except ads would be a great car. i have ads, i have, curren acura y both a 2009  audi  prestige + sport pakage (that has ads) and a 2012 acura  acura   technology .in 2009 but not in 2011 or 2012 audi  audi  2.0t prestige + sport or sline packages, i see less of a need for the $3,000 ads option due to the fact that the new  audi 's can be had with an 8-  performance   tiptronic that comes with sport shift and in sport package or sline configuration comes with a lowered sport suspension and sport  seat  and a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.in other words, today, i would not get an  audi  2.0t prestige + sline, w/ 8   performance   tiptronic and  hyundai  up for the ads.another reason i would not get this option today: on the  audi ,   performance   vectoring is not an option (yet). i would pay for the ads -- on an  audi  -- if it came with tv.the s4, at $50,000 is content poor compared with a $47k  acura   technology  -- but the s4 can be had with tv, under the name sport differential. i believe to get tv, however, one needs to buy ads (on the s4.) the total additional cost to get both ads+sport differential is, as i recall, about $4,500.the s4 i would want would have to be contented to the  acura   technology  level, and that requires that the s4 be configured not as a premium plus, but as a prestige model.if you do all of this to an s4, its msrp is some $12,000 more than the acura  acura   technology  with backup   safety  s (which is how i have mine configured.)now, having  toyota d all of this, i would rather have the s4 than the  acura . moreover, i would have, at the time, gone with a 2012 audi  audi  2.0t prestige+sline without ads, if the price on a 36 month lease was comparable to the acura lease (the msrp's would have been very close to each other so configured.)i should stipulate, that to save a bit, i would be fine with the  audi  2.0t prestige 8-  performance   tiptronic version with either sport package or sline, and i know the sport package would have been somewhat less money than sline, which, for the price difference only includes trim differences not suspension or other   performance   inducing differences.in any case, my decision was not based on which car i thought was the best -- i went with the one (this time) that i thought was the best value. the  acura   technology  (with the oddly optional back up   safety  s @ $725) filled that bill very nicely. my lease on the  acura  for 36 months was about $150 per month less than the lease on the audi  audi  (prestige, sport, etc, etc) for 42 months. at 36 months (apples to apples) the audi was about $200 per month more than the  acura  which, although it ain't no audi, is -- for $200 per month less -- a fine imitation.i've had 29 audis, since 1977. i have been to the ingolstadt factory for the how they build 'em tour, 6 times. i have participated in 4 audi driving schools in seefeld, austria (and won one of them --   performance  est time through the course.) i, for a number of years, would bleed lit acura e interconnected rings when cut. audi of america sent me to st. moritz along with 49 other of their ""top 50"" north american customers for the audi sponsored women's downhill ski cup event.and, i bought one of the first  audi 's in 1997 (ordered in 1996 and waited 11 months) after audi sent my dealership a euro-spec  audi  and asked the dealer to loan it to his top customers for 24 hours (undoubtedly a ploy to make the star struck customers order up a new  audi  -- which i did.)if the above doesn't qualify me at some level to judge or at least opine about the differences and similarities between an acura  acura   technology  and an audi  audi  or s4, i don't know what else does.if i could somehow have been convinced that the audi was not just incrementally better than the acura, but substantially better, i would have probably gone with the 2012 audi  audi  2.0t prestige sline w/8-  performance   tip. but after driving two audis, an  audi  and an s4 (2011's and the  audi  did not have the sport package -- or sline, and the s4 was what is simply called premium plus and it did not have the sport differential) then driving a cadillac  cadillac /4 with the 19"" wheel sport package (2011) and then the acura  acura   technology , i thought the acura  acura  was most like an s4 than it was an  audi  or a  cadillac .i also drove a volvo  volvo  t6, an infiniti  infiniti x/s and an infiniti  bmw 7x premium+  technology nology , and an acurca zdx   technology nology . while my '09  audi  was in for service i also had been loaned a 2011 audi  audi  3.0t premium plus for a day.every one of these  car  were test driven (and i was video'd by my wife whilst i was driving and giving a running commentary) over the exact same route, the sound  technology s were tested with the exact same cd's/tunes (wecome to the machine, pink floyd; how dare you, 10cc; and, new  nissan , donald fagen.)so, i offer up for your consideration: the audi, acura, cadillac, infiniti and volvo are all great  car  and more alike than different, generally speaking. i wouldn't kick any of them out of bed for eating crackers, and i'd even bring the crackers.you can argue that the audi is the prettiest (which it is) and the acura the ugliest (well, hell, that's true too -- even though it is less ugly for 2012), the cadillac is the ""blingy-est"" (no doubt) and the infiniti's remain the japanese bmw's,

"tlong","October 2011"," i have owned both audi and acura. i tend to agree that for a big price, the audi is generally a nicer car. but your post is biased based upon irrelevant criteria, imho. "" car  developed for the autobahn"" - all of these car companies are selling worldwide and all need to meet various needs of different countries, whether that be suspension tuning or emissions or left/right side drive. some  honda s in fact are developed in the usa. germans develop  car  in the us, gm develops  car  in europe and china and australia. it's quite simpl toyota ic to assume that parent country of origin = where the car is developed.""comes with a 4cy   performance   that pumps out 170lbs of   performance  "" - seems to me that bmw and mb have plenty of 4 cyl   performance  s in europe (on the autobahn  ) and somehow that's ok. ""the acura  acura  has a narrow price elasti honda "" - frankly, i don't see why price elasti honda  has anything to do with being a sports sedan, as if tacking on $10k to a price makes a non sports-sedan into one.ultimately, a sports sedan shouldn't be about cachet, or where it was developed, or whether it is fwd or rwd or 4wd, or whether there is an autobahn or potholes nearby, or whether the platform is shared with economy  car , or whether the price is high or low or elastic or inelastic. what matters is how the car handles, how it feels, how well appointed it is. given those criteria, acuras are pretty close to a lot of the european offerings.

"fedlawman","October 2011"," you know, i remember the discussion when the  acura  first came out in 2003. back then, it was the mazd audi  owners who challenged that the  acura  wasn't a "" comfort "" car and the mazd audi  was superior because it had ""similar amenities"" and a more   performance  ful v6 (a recurring theme...).well, there is the difficult to articulate quality of precision, refinement, and craftsmanship that the  acura  possesses in spades that more pedestrian  car  lack.all you have to do is sit behind the wheel of the  hyundai  and you immediately know it is an economy car. one drive and you instan acura y feel that lack of chassis and driveline refinement.the  honda  is another beast altogether. the  honda  is arguably ""luxurious"" enough to compare with the bottom of the ellps class. it does lack some    technology nology nology s expected here like xenon headlights, driver memory settings, etc., but more importan acura y, it lacks a sporting character. it is a big car - sof acura y sprung with flat  seat . the precision and refinement are there, but it doesn't have the  toyota mics of a sport sedan.yes, you could go online and get summer tires, sway bars, springs/struts and make it a handler, but then what you would have is a large, slushbox equipped, harsh riding family car (last year, i equipped my volvo with bilsteins and know first-hand what a disaster that was!).so why try to shoehorn the  honda  into a category it wasn't   design  ed or suited for when honda already makes a car that is the epitome of the ellps segment? a nimble, fun, refined sedan that has a terrific   performance   and gearbox with a modicum of  comfort ?

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," there are so many  car  out there that aren't fantastic at one thing, they don't   design   good on paper, but they are great  car  to drive. my  acura  is one car that falls into that category. it's 201 hp 4 cylinder is not going to win any stoplight or out of a toll booth race. you really have to drive a  acura  & a v6  honda  back to back. they ""are not"" the same car.you seem to be a ""car guy"" and you know that a factory tuned suspension upgrade is so much better than one you can piece together from autozone or any various internet site. it's like some people who say ""why do i need to spend $xx,xxx more for an  bmw  (or s4) when i can just chip my  bmw  (or  audi  2.0t) for $x,xxx and get just as much or even more   performance  ?"". there's also a company out there that makes a bolt-on super dodge  for a v6  ford . it makes the v6 good for 475 horse  performance  . if you were in the market for a  ford , would you buy a 5.0 gt or a v6 and get it supercharged? i'll take the v8.i'll agree with you and fedlawman that the  acura  v6 is a nose heavy pig. i personally don't think it needs to be in the acura lineup. a v6  acura  has a sticker damn near a fwd  acura  & honda puts crazy $4000 cash incentives on the v6  acura  to sell it. i have the sane gripes with c&d regarding its electric   performance   steering. the original  acura  was a smashing success for acura. i think the 1st year they only expected to sell 15,000 units. how many did they sell that 1st year?you have to remember that us enthusiasts are a sliver of a small percentage of the market. i believe the 2 main gripes (from the general buying public) were the small-ish back seat & modest   performance   output. they made the car bigger (adding weight) and added a v6 option (whic doesn't sell well & adds weight &   performance   steer) anything the ""tuner crowd"" says acura should use from it's parts bin will ruin the car's driving character toyota ics & appeal. ""give it sh awd"" adds weight, cost, & complexity. ""give it the 4cyl turbo from the  acura "" adds cost, complexity, & weight. not to mention   performance   steer as well. part of the  acura 's charm & appeal in this ellps segment is it's price point which it gets from being built on an  honda  platform (or being an  honda  from the rest of the world), it's 201 horse  performance   4 cyl   performance  , 5   performance   automatic transmission (you want a 6 or an 8   performance   auto, that'll cost you too), low weight, the fact that acura even offers a slick shifting 6-  performance   manual transmission.try walking on to your local bmw, audi, mb, lexus dealer and tell me how many 3,c, audi ,is have msrps under $40,000. yes i know you can order your car any way you like it. acura gets you into the door of this segment.like fedlawman  toyota d, drive it against an is250 &  infiniti  to tell me it isn't competitive and doesn't belong. ive never driven a  infiniti , but have driven an is250 awd (high 90% of sales in the northeast) & it's 201 horse  performance   v6 accelerates about as   performance   as a toyota  toyota . the  acura 's base 4cyl is lively & happy to rev all the way to it's 7,000 rpm redline. i can tell you it has a certain germanic ride quality to it. very solid and extremely stable on the right side of 80 mph.

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," a large percentage of any of these  car  are leased. you can't go by the manual transmission take rate to decide whether or not any particular car belongs in this category. the take rate for manual transmissions in the usa in general is probably less than 10%.people lease for 4 reasons:business reasons where they can take some sort of tax deduction.they can afford to & like to be in a new car every 2-3 years.leasing is used as an alternative method of financing that works quite well if you can live within mileage limitations.people lease to get a more expensive car at a cheaper payment. many of these people do not understand leasing and shouldn't be doing it.there are tons of leased  acura s,  acura s, 328s, 335s,  audi s, is 250s... among others in my area. i was nyccarguy a long time ago in a  ford  far, far away. i fled the  honda  back in '04 for westchester county & moved to stamford, ct last year. not long "
"rayainsw","October 2011"," some details: day 1 &#150; friday 16 sept. &#150; delivery & drive to krimml, austria:we cleared customs and collected our checked bags without incident. service on the flight was excellent, and the food [ 2 meals ! ] was quite good. [lufthansa  audi 40-600.] we met rolf [ retired bmw employee ] at the   design  ated spot and he drove us [ in his bmw diesel wagon ] first to the local bmw dealer in munich and across the street to acquire several excellent local maps and the toll vignettes [ stickers ] required in austria and in switzerland, then delivered us to the welt. just in time to watch the 11am &#145;motorcycle on the stairs&#146; show. interesting. rolf charges a very reasonable fee, and it was great to just try to sit back and relax [ after a 6.5 hour flight from boston ] while he drove and talked.we filled out the required paperwork and the customer service rep. recited a l toyota  of potentially useful information &#150; most of which i had seen before on various forums. he was quite efficient and cordial &#150; and answered a few of our questions. the reminder about &#145;no right turn on red&#146; was quite handy &#150; as this was something i had to keep reminding myself about all trip long. and i was cautioned again that switzerland traffic police allowed no violation of their   performance   limits &#150; period. noted. we had about 45 minutes until our scheduled orientation and background presentation, so we sampled various goodies in the &#147;premier lounge&#148;. very nicely done & convenient &#150; high above & over  design  ing the vehicle delivery area.we had our presentation [ fine, nothing spectacular &#150; for me ] and went to see the car. the customer service rep. pointed out various    technology nology nology s [ this is my first bmw ] and set various preferences [ km vs. miles for the trip, etc. ] and we were on our way. [ pictures ]actually just had them park it for another half hour or so, allowing us to peruse their gift shop briefly and pick up a few food & drink items at their caf?, for the afternoon drive.they certainly treat you well and the process is well thought out - and we enjoyed the experience. we could have also done a factory tour and \ or the bmw museum, but i had decided not to do those this time, based on our priorities & our schedule.i had rented a   technology nology  \ navigation  technology  with appropriate maps, and the first use was to help me drive out of munich and onto the  audi  heading south and east. worked well here &#150; and several other times, as well. here it was quite helpful in showing what lane[s] to be in before approaching turns, etc. once on the autobahn, i was quite well behaved,   performance  -wise - even on the few unlimited stretches of this highway &#150; breaking in the new motor & all.my daughter was quite tired and dozed off as we left the  audi  and headed straight south on a12 \ e45 \ e60 toward the austrian border.the navigation  technology  routed us differen acura y than i had expected, and i did not realize it immediately. it also re-routed us a few times around what it saw as traffic congestion [ there was none ] so we were a couple of hours later than expected arriving at the b&b in krimml. a lovely b&b within sight of the falls. had a very good dinner in their rest saturn nt &#150; beer brewed on-site, met my daughter&#146;s approval - and we went to bed. = = =day 2 &#150; saturday 17 sept. &#150; krimml to verona, italythere had been rain overnight &#150; and there were wispy clouds around the area &#150; with thick overcast.

[ pictures ]after we   design  ed the hike, we stopped at their caf? for coffee and an apple strudel. excellent! we stopped back in the village to just stroll around for a while, just enjoying the ambiance.then we were off &#150; heading up to the gerlos pass. the sun was out and we stopped several times to just enjoy the views. just after passing the summit [ and paying the toll ] we pulled off at a tiny [ closed ] &#145;kiosk&#146; and scenic v toyota a &#150; lovely lake and glaciers above.

[ pictures ]we ended up staying at an exquisite lit acura e hotel in san bernardino. just before the entrance to the san bernardino tunnel, this a tiny old village &#150; primarily geared to skiing. we were &#145;off-season&#146; and the town was very  comfort . the water in the creek running through town was clear. the air was crisp, cool and clear. just lovely. we had excellent fondue for dinner in the hotel&#146;s rest saturn nt and slept well &#150; enjoying the fresh mountain air &#150; at over 5,000 feet elevation. day 8 &#150; friday 23 sept. s. bernardino to memmingen, germanywe had another excellent break  performance   [ more wonderful bread ] at the hotel and headed north. on the autobahn [ 96 \ e54 \ e43 ] approaching memmingen, i had my one opportunity to briefly explore the outer limits of [ my experience in ] legal, very high   performance   driving. a break in traffic [ friday pm ] allowed a quick blast to 135+ mph. exhilarating. but traffic again intervened and i was back to 100 &#150; 115, or so on most of the unlimited sections. this was also the case the next day, saturday, going to the munich airport &#150; generally able to hold a steady 100, with a few blasts to 115 or so &#150; then back to 100. holding 115 mph for a few minutes at one point was quite satisfying. being passed while doing 100 mph by porsches [ and others, but most often porsches ] clearly doing 140, 150 mph or more was quite an experience as well!we arrived in memmingen in time to spend a few hours exploring the old  honda  area, town square, churches, etc. we ate dinner at the hotel - very good.day 9 = final day &#150; saturday 24 sept. &#150; memmingen to munich airport and fly back to bostonwe slept well, until a local, nearby church rang the &#147;100 o&#146;clock&#148; bells. the ringing just kept on and on &#150; at 7am. oh, well &#150; time to rise and shine. another very traditional break  performance   at the hotel, an hour or so at the farmers&#146; market in the town square [ best   design  ing produce and fruit i have ever seen ! ] and we packed up for the last leg of our  dodge . we drove to a car wash, then to a final fuel stop [ ended with exac acura y the quarter tank the shipper recommends ] and drove to the airport to drop the car off, and [ after waiting in several lines, including 2 security checkpoints, since we were flying to the us ] we flew home without incident.a few overall impressions:this was a wonderful trip. it is hard to describe the feeling of driving for miles through what   design  s like the biggest postcard in the world. large areas of both switzerland and austria were   safety  olutely magnificent and spectacular. cinque terre was all we had hoped. we spent 2 full days exploring and enjoying all 5 towns and it was amazing. the other 2 small villages we visited near the b&b on our third day there were a charming surprise as well.the times i was stressed were mos acura y a result of no experience driving anywhere in europe and knowing very lit acura e german or italian. [ meaning, mos acura y my fault. ] i do not expect to return to europe anytime in the next few years [ if ever ] and my daughter had downloaded a translation app. for both italian and german - so did not expend a lot of time or effort trying to learn the languages. some of the country and village roads in italy were scary narrow. and i wish they had the option to just buy a sticker for use of their toll roads. my one &#145;incident&#146; [ scraped the left front rim ] was while struggling to deal with an un-attended toll booth at an exit somewhere south of trento after dark. i drove too close to the curb, trying to understand and deal with the instructions and reach the ticket \ credit card slots, etc. [ sigh ] oh, well.why not rome or florence or   mercury   or venice, one might ask? my daughter spent over a week in italy a couple of years ago, and had an opportunity to visit each of those places. and i was just personally much more interested in the austrian and swiss alps and the italian mediterranean coast than the cities. we were both quite happy with our choices!the car &#150; 2011  bmw s coupe, le mans blue, gray leather, dct, premium package,  toyota  access, heated front  seat , satellite radio.http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/10 audi /2011_bmw_ bmw s-short_take_road_test- - i test drove 2  car  equipped essentially identical to what i bought, except they both had the optional 19&#148; wheels & tires. for me & for my typical driving, i decided that the 18s would be fine &#150; and offer a somewhat better ride. the car was delivered with michelin  honda s &#150; excellent tires. continued...

"
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," i have been reading the endless running commentary apparen acura y about the inclusion of the  acura  in this discussion forum. i tend to agree the  acura  doesn't fit in with the other  car  -- i am on day three of having a loaner  acura  while my  acura  gets backup   safety  s installed (i live in cincinnati and the dealer is in columbus, and i travel to columbus every saturday, so here i sit with a  acura  and an '09 audi  audi  prestige/sport (tiptronic) at my disposal.)over the weekend i drove both  car  extensively -- i prefer the audi, duh! but the  acura  was ""a very nice lit acura e car."" it seems outclassed by the other  car  in this forum, but, i say let it stay here and let's not bash it. it seems the  acura  is a fine machine, but is somewhat lacking in both lux and   performance   character toyota ics -- for my taste.let's move on, let's accept the fact that all of these  car  are fine machines in their own right. they can't all be bmw's or audi's or whatever your ideal is of an ellps. i think i have driven virtually all of the  car  l toyota ed at the top of the page -- i like some better than others, but, overall i think they are all mighty fine.since i just leased a new  acura , i would assume you might think i am going to tell you how great the  acura  is and how it could kick your fill-in-the-blank car's butt. maybe it could, maybe it couldn't. i didn't get it for that reason -- i got it because of its value. i may live to regret buying on that criteria -- i'll let you know.i will be turning in my audi this week -- i will miss it. at 53,000 miles it feels like it is about a 20,000 mile old car -- and since the tires have plenty of tread, it still performs better than most  car  on the highway. but, so does the  acura  sh-awd  technology . while the audi is ""better"" (as far as i am concerned) i just don't see that the price premium the audi commands is justified. that is just me, perhaps -- i know that (finally) audis are once again selling well, most reliability issues are behind it (i can testify, however, that i never had reliability issues with 28 of my 29 audis), its   design   always turns head and the driving experience is only rivaled by infiniti and acura -- and bmw, of course.yet, you know, the  volvo  is the car i would have most liked to have leased for 36 months if there would have been any wiggle room in the  volvo  cap cost (which there was zero). if you have driven an  volvo  t6, you know what i am talking about -- it seems like a hell of a lot of fun. truth be told, i thought the  volvo  t6 was more fun than a new 3 series x-drive flavor. the  cadillac  too, had its merits, but one deal breaker -- no omg handles for the driver or front-seat passenger (whose dumb idea was that?!?) i wouldn't take the  cadillac  seriously for that one omission -- and for love nor money, you couldn't get blind spot warning on a  cadillac  4-door sedan (again, at this price point, in this class, a serious omission, specially when you can get a  ford  with it for pity's sake.)anyway, i pretty much like or love most of the  car  in this class -- they are the right size, the right   performance   (usually) and make an old fart like me feel like i am driving something that can outperform virtually anything else on i-71 and i-75 here in the big town of cincinnapolis.drive it like you live.i'll sign off now, knowing i am often wrong, but never uncertain.mark :surprise: "

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," no, it takes one day to install the back-up   safety  s. i live in cincinnati, the purchasing dealer (where i also purchased the   safety  s from, and incorporated them into the lease now that they can be capitalized) is in columbus.100 miles separate these cities.i travel every saturday to columbus. the arrangement was this -- drop off the car, pick up the loaner, then pick up the car the following saturday. this, for better or worse, gives me the use of the  acura  for about a week.i am able to note the acura upgrades to what is essentially a honda of some kind (people here say it is an  honda ). the fit and   design   and the   design   are certainly somewhat upgraded over what you would get in a honda.but, despite these upgrades and the requirements for premium fuel, the  acura  doesn't, to me, represent an entry into the ellps crowd. but, as i  toyota d, live and let live, keep it in and we'll see what happens.i would think that the  acura  would be ""naturally"" cross-shopped with an audi  audi  -- for instance. but, as i  toyota d, i cross shopped a 2012  acura  sh-awd  technology  with an audi  audi  2.0t prestige tiptronic and, for fun, i drove a premium plus s4, more or less stripped of the lux bits and w/o the sport differential (  performance   vectoring). also, i shopped the acura against a  cadillac /4  comfort  edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifters as well as against a volvo  volvo  t6 and against an infiniti  infiniti x/s and an  bmw 7x premium+  technology nology . having just come from a 2008 bmw (my wife's), i did not   design   at a 3 series, my german preferences satisfied with the  audi  and/or s4.to me, these cross shopping ad toyota s seem mos acura y rational (the  bmw 7x is an ou acura ier) -- i would not have considered a  acura  anymore than i would have considered an  audi , for instance.i drove my 2009  audi  prestige with the 19"" sport package to work, yesterday -- today i drove the  acura  in. i would say the differences were like filet mignon vs l saturn 's lean hamburger patties. i like both of them, but prefer the filet, by far.i did test drive both of the audis and the acura on the same saturday in june -- i also test-drove the  cadillac  i mentioned. the acura was, best i can describe, like an audi as4  audi  if such a model actually ex toyota ed.anyway, sorry to digress -- again -- but the back-up   safety  s are not taking this long, the issue is where i live vs where i bought. once the   safety  s are in, i will either use a cincinnati acura dealer for service or i will take advantage of lindsay acura's saturday service for things like oil changes and tire rotation, etc. "

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," about the slaughtering my  acura  has taken lately. i'm going to somewhat agree with sweendogy and say that my  acura  is a ""sporty sedan"" instead of an all out ""sports sedan."" considering some of the  car  its being considered to by some posters here (no disrespect to anybody in particular), might not be entirely fair. a fully loaded up almost $50,000  audi  with  audi , sports suspension, and   performance   vectoring rear differential. i would hope the audi drives a whole helluva lot better. same thing with a  acura -sh awd.the  acura  v6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and you'd have to really hate the base  acura  to buy a  acura  v6 with a similar msrp (even though the v6  acura  is loaded with incentives most of the time).where does the  acura  go from here? you can't give it more   performance   because it will   performance   steer like crazy. you can't give it acura's sh-awd because that will add weight and price.the  acura  is a great car. i own one and love it. it has a taut suspension, adequate   performance  , fantastically supportive  seat . it it fun to drive, gets good gas mileage...i'm happy with the decision i made to buy it. i've got over 41,000 miles on it after only 25 months. in a lit acura e less than 3 years it will be paid off and i'll hopefully be able to drive it relatively trouble free for well past the 100,000 mile mark.if there was never a cash for clunkers prog dodge , we drove our leased x3 for the entire 3 years and it had 60k miles instead of 45k for 3 years, would i have even set foot into an acura dealership? probably not. if something happened to my  acura  today, would i get another one? i'm not so sure.

"nyccarguy","October 2011"," i think be because the  acura  is the bread & butter of the acura lineup. acura probably doesn't want the ""lesser""  acura  to steal sales from the  acura . the  acura  is acura's entry level car (that actually has more trunk  comfort  than the  acura ). they want you to buy (or lease) a  acura , then trade up to a base  acura  a few years later, then to a  acura  sh awd not too long after that, & be so happy with the  car /brand that you buy (or lease) an  acura  for your wife every few years.a v6  acura    technology nology  stickers for high $30's. add sh-awd to that and you've got a close to $40k  acura . maybe come trade up time you say ""i like my  acura  sh-awd, but don't think the  acura  sh awd warrants the price jump."". maybe you go   design   at infiniti or bmw or mb...i'm not comparing the  car , but kinda like the reason porsche messes with the cayman's gearing and won't give it too big a motor to protect the 911.

"
"graphicguy","October 2011"," nyc.....i've made a couple of st  safety   at testing a g. they're good  car . they kind of cover the gamut. the  infiniti  targets the  acura , probably an  audi  and a  bmw . the  infiniti  seems to target  bmw . i believe the  acura  sh awd is up the ladder a lit acura e from the g, however. while the  infiniti  is   performance  , i feel my  bmw  is   performance  er with more neutral    performance    and a better ride. refinement in both the  acura  and the 3 are much higher than in the g.so, as mentioned before, the g tries to cover a lot of ground.my fear (and one of the main reasons i bought the '11 3) is that bmw is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. nothing inheren acura y wrong with that. audi's been doing that for years with their  audi . but, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least we'd accept.mark...i tried to find an s4 at both the audi connection and in dayton. all they had were used ones. as you say, you get about 95%+ of an s4 in the  acura  sh awd, for a whole lot less money. interesting enough, the cincinnati audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new  car ....a few  audi s, a few  audi s....one  audi  and a splattering of the qs. nothing that gra toyota ed me. and, i went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. the guys at beechmont had 3-s4s, and a whole lot of  audi s, but i just couldn't bring myself to pay a premium over my  acura  sh awd when push came to shove.now, if either of them had stocked an  audi  or s5 (which they didn't), my decision might have been different. the only  audi s they had were convertibles and i don't think the new s5 was out yet. "
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," the audi connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the european (at least the german) way of buying a car: visit dealer,   design   at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait. no instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide, ""let's go buy a new car. . .today!"" and we're off to the races. we leave our houses late on a saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, we've picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a chinese rest saturn nt for some take out.sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at lowes.the germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)i was lucky that the ac had a basically stripped s4 in stock a few months ago (an '11). it didn't even have nav (at that price). it had the dsg tranny and it had, apparen acura y, huge urge. it felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the  audi  (non sport) or the  acura , although at full cry the  acura 's 3.7l motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the  audi  2.0t). the great thing about the audi's is that they use fsi and are either super or turbo charged. imagine for 30 seconds what the  acura  3.7 sh-awd would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5l now enjoys.acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a "" acura /s"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better    safety    (brembo's with the cool   design  ing caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in. perhaps it could move the awd bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/s"" on the trunk lid (sub acura e visual cues that only acura aficionados would appreciate.) i'd probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the  technology  19"" wheel, only different.perhaps this would add too much to the msrp and the acura advantage (value) would, for many, vanish and they would get the sline  audi  or the s4 or the volvo  volvo  r   design  , or even the bimmer.i would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more   performance   oriented  acura . after all,   design   at the   performance   leanings of -- wait for it -- lexus for pity's sake, lexus!sir your high   performance   la-z-boy is ready. never thought that would happen!c'mon acura -- you've clearly got some great   performance  s (thinking of indy  car , for example) in your dna, let 'em out. let my people go. :surprise: "

"
"markcincinnati","October 2011"," the  infiniti , from a   performance   perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.go on-line to infiniti and select a  infiniti  or 37x (and you can, if you like even go for the ""s"" models). crank the options to 11 and you will find the g remains available with an msrp that begins with a ""$4"" -- with a 328hp   performance   and premium package, navigation package, sport package,   technology nology nology package,   design    hyundai s packge, rear decklid spoiler and midnight black grille package,  suzuki  guards, stainless steel il chevrolet ted kick plates, led daytime running lights and   design    hyundai  lighting all for an msrp of: $46,940. this car imho is not comparable to a bmw 328.now, i am not in any way suggesting that the bmw is not a ""superior"" vehicle (car & driver, despite loving the g, loves the bmw even more). many magazine writers do opine that infiniti's  infiniti  and  infiniti x are japanese bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the g in the #2 spot.well, hell, try to equip the comparable bmw 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the g above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the bmw's msrp under $50,000.""again, i am not suggesting that the bmw is #2 in this contest -- i am simply suggesting that a g equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the bimmer would probably show the infiniti it's butt quite a bit of the time.but if you're   design  ing for value, the infiniti must be at the top of the l toyota . a  infiniti  (x or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7l motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a  toyota able commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.for the price, the bimmer just can't cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, i  toyota d ""for the price.""additionally, the g's have very very attractive lease prog dodge s -- often better than bmw's attractive prog dodge s. :shades: "

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," at the price point and at the ""class"" (ellps) we are talking about, the value leaders remain infiniti and acura. more content and by some definition, i'm sure, more car for the money when you're comparing infiniti to bmw (which seems to be the comparison that ""everybody"" makes); i think i'll compare acura to audi, for the time being -- it seems somehow to work for me.the  infiniti xs was a car i wanted to like -- but i was smitten with the  bmw 7x which seems to me to be priced (lease price per month) at about what an audi  audi  2.0t prestige goes for or what a bmw 335 (with x-drive and a fair amount of options) goes for. the  infiniti xs after coming from an audi  audi  (2009 vintage) seemed ""c dodge ped"" -- too narrow and with, apparen acura y, no expanse of hood to speak of.yet, the g was pretty well loaded and was very spunky -- gobs of   performance  , albeit with a lit acura e harshness as the rpm's moved toward red-line (neither the audi or bmw   performance   seem harsh.) had the car been at least 2"" wider, i might have gone infiniti rather than acura. i certainly feel infiniti, as a brand, has the lps ""vision"" (whatever the hell that means) whereas neither lexus nor acura seem to have much of a clue.but, i got behind the wheel of the  acura   technology  and it was wider, i could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the   performance   compartment and the sound of the 3.7l at full cry is quite pleasing. too bad the  acura  isn't quite as quick feeling as the g -- but man, the  acura  has the g in  comfort ness -- the  acura  is like butta!i am growing, slowly, very slowly, to accept the   design  s of the  acura  (  design  ), i am pleased with the   design   -- the  seat  are almost audi quality and they are ventilated (a must have, i am almost embarrassed to say.)the  acura  is -- on paper -- damn near the perfect definition of an ellps (but only in  technology  trim or   technology nology  trim with a 6   performance  , based on reviews -- and only if it is sh-awd equipped.) here's a 1,500 mile review: comfort  and  comfort : checkfeels bigger than it is: checkis,   technology nology nially, bigger than some of the others in this class: check, checkbest factory sound  technology  ever: checkvery quick, very responsive transmission (especially with the paddle shifters): checkthick, meaty steering wheel, great ""sporty""  seat : check, check   technology nology nology  set is at least as good as the other ellps's: check  performance   vectoring reduces (a lot) the sensation of understeer: checkdecent gas mileage (combined 26  honda ing to the center display): check (this thing is almost stingy with gas, in fact): checkand the l toyota  of positive attributes could go on and on.i do like driving the  acura  -- very much -- i don't regret getting it, especially at $499/mo plus tax, and, so far, the dealer seems terrific (lindsay acura, columbus, oh.)however, the sum of its parts pretty much equals, er, the sum of its parts. audi and bmw (and i'll assume mercedes) somehow seem to imbue their  car  with ""something"" that makes them feel like more than the sum of their parts.it's not that the  acura  seems flimsy or not stiff and firm -- it does. but there is something that is lacking -- something that a new  audi  prestige sport or a new 335 x-drive will have and you will notice instan acura y. in some ways, for the price, the  acura  outdoes (content wise) both audi and bmw by a wide margin. in other ways, the  acura  seems like the best damn appliance electrolux ever made -- take it away kelly ripa! 34 payments to go. . . :surprise: klikie klikie :blush: "

"m6user","October 2011"," people purchase  car  for different reasons and just because they want a somewhat sporty sedan they may not need or even want the greatest ""feel behind the wheel"". they may be shopping price and size as the most important factors on their heiracrchy of needs. the  acura  is a lot more similar in size/weight to the 3 than the  acura  is. they may want good winter    safety    but not neccesarily the best. while front wheel drive isn't quite as good as all wheel drive is pretty adequate especially if you use snow tires in the winter. stepping up to the  acura  sh-awd is also quite a jump in price from the tx. about 10k or so and about 3k more than the 3ix. the  acura  sh-awd is also about 500 lbs heavier than the  acura . the  acura  is 16"" longer than the bmw....that is a lot. while it may not drive that much heavier it is still a much larger car and many people just don't want that much metal to manuever around. i like the  infiniti  but would get it in ""x"" form because of winter    safety   . if i bought a  acura , the front wheel drive would be adequate without having to jump up in price. don't really care about the extra hp or being able to take hairpins at   performance  . your car buying criteria may be different than others   design  ing at the same class of auto....nothing wrong with that. so it is not wrong to cross shop the  acura  with the bmw 3, it is completely right for many people.by the way, i enjoyed your suggestions for improvement over on the 2012  acura  thread. very in depth on the pros and cons.

"markcincinnati","October 2011"," thanks for the compliment -- it is just that acura seems soooo close to producing really interesting  car , close but not quite there yet. acura is now, in my ""often wrong, never uncertain"" opinion, where volvo was a very few years ago. then the  volvo  comes along and acura slips to where volvo used to be -- no interesting  car , just very good ones that are probably about as reliable and durable as humans know how to build (at these prices.)i could not advise anyone to choose the  acura  over the 3 x-drive, the differences are not sub acura e.but again, i come from the viewpoint: often wrong, but never uncertain.drive it like you live, not like i live!!! :shades: "

"renssils","October 2011"," after driving my 2012 acura  acura  sh-awd with  technology  package and automatic transmission for 8,000 miles, i can make a few observations. the car has been reliable, though lately it rat acura es, perhaps from the sunroof. the  seat  are  toyota able. the hvac and in-car electronics are excellent. on the highway it gets about 27 miles a gallon; in town, about 17 miles a gallon. the   performance   and transmission are both  comfort  and  comfort .within 250 miles of my getting the  acura  at the end of april 2011, i bought a set of four continental contiextreme dw summer tires, which are so much better than the oem goodyear tires. the  acura  on the conti tires is fun to drive! the contis stick like glue, are  comfort er, and  comfort er riding. today in anticipation of winter, the goodyears were installed on the  acura ; the contis will be stored until next april. i will miss the contis. i recall that the goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. i hope that they'll perform well in shallow snow.i've owned several high-  performance   all-wheel-drive  sedan  including a 2001 audi  audi  4.2 sport, a subaru svx, which is my all-time favorite, and two subaru  subaru  spec.b  sedan . i was inclined to get a new audi s4, but chose the  acura  after driving a bmw  bmw x, volvo  volvo  t6, and infiniti  bmw 7x. the  acura  seemed to be the best all-around vehicle. the  acura  was appreciably less cos acura y to lease than the other  car . the  acura  delights in many ways, but disappoints in some ways. the forward visibility is atrocious. thick, raked a-pillars create huge blind spots; turning left or right always seems risky. rear visibility is severely limited. the back up   safety   has primitive software and furthermore rain on the   safety  's lens reduces its utility. the trunk is oddly   design  d and small for a 194-inch long car; if you don't lift the trunk deck as high as it will go, its pointed bottom lip will stab you. the only clock is an inch-long digital display buried in a panel near the radio buttons. the navigation  technology 's  technology  has irritating quirks that should have debugged long ago. the car would benefit from a reduction in window and road noise.the  acura  is so close to being a fine car, but i wouldn't buy it or any car ever again with small windows, high belt line, and atrocious visibility.

"robbieg","October 2011"," i would think that in the real world few people actaully want a ""  performance   car"". most people want a slush box and not a stick. furthermore, at least in my next of the woods, people don't want a rwd bmw or mercedes. they want awd so it goes in the snow. in short,   performance   isn't that big of a deal. the  acura  is every bit as sporty as a  cadillac  or the  volvo  if not more so. it seems people in this forum, which i have read on and off for years, care about a manual transmission and rear wheel drive. well, few if any of those  car  are sold in my area. most  bmw  are x-drive and with only a few manuals are actually sold.

"shipo","November 2011"," regarding the whole start/stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, i don't think it will affect   performance   longevity at all. why? because the bulk of   performance   wear comes when cold starting an   performance   where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.other fuel economy related thoughts:i find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if i might be so bold, highly questionable. from my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust  technology  to   performance   the various sub technology s of the vehicle. i'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary   performance   lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the   performance   ass toyota  pumps, the a/c compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the   performance   and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. the only company which has announced such a research project is bmw; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later.

"
"dino001","November 2011"," you didn't undestand the actual comments:1. putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage (which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company). if car gets totalled, the downpayment is gone, gone, gone, whereas if you put nothing down, gap (included in lease) will pick it up. other advantages are businesses don't need to commit capital and get better tax treatment (not really applicable for consumer). that's why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way - they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads. doesn't mean that one has to go for it - quite to contrary, it's generally bad idea, period.2. people who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease, which means they should not lease. lease is much more complex financing instrument with more v honda bles that can be manipulated to create illusion of lower price. there are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing - but not because of lower payment, but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value (after return, the manufacturer's bank has to eat the price difference). one who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it, otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term, when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches. all of that has to be factored in. that's why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment, most likely they can't afford the car (""don't deserve""). it really is a simple rule of thumb - if you can't afford to buy it (loan/cash), you can't afford to lease it, either. there are some exceptions for very low mileage users, or subsidized leases, but just because monthly payment is lower, it doens't mean it's cheaper.i went through it with my recent purchase. i got 328 wagon with a few options ($45k msrp). correc acura y structured lease (0 down, 15k/yr) was about $200 per month less than 60 month loan with small ($2500) downpayment (yes - loan downpayments are making perfect sense, as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total). to me $200 per month is   safety  olutely not enough, especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan. i made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal. higher monthly payments, but better deal overall. now, if somebody lives in monthly payment world, they may not really understand the concept, but that's a different discussion.

"smarty666","November 2011"," leasing really was a great alternative 5-6 years ago and i used to do it, but since then, the car companies have gotten greedy and over value the residuals and make it impossible to get out of the leasing cycle once you start in it. for instance, 5-6 years ago, my leases used to have great residuals and buyouts so that if you really feel in love with the car and wanted to buy it, you could without it breaking the bank. some companies would even work with you to lower the buyout. that is no more. now, the car companies inflate the residuals making the buyouts thousands of dollars over msrp and put disposition fees, etc because they want you to return the car at the end of the lease and get something else from them, thus never ending the cycle. i found this out the hard way and one of my vehicles is still on lease. it is going to be my last lease as i'm switching back to financing.

"dino001","November 2011"," i   design  ed back at your post. at f toyota  glance  infiniti    design  s better than 328 even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments. i   design  ed at the websites and it appears that both have 10k/yr (so you can enjoy your car mos acura y in your garage, not on the road). however, infiniti expe cadillac  dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup - $41k msrp less $2.7k due is $38.3k, yet net cap cost (including $700 acq. fee) is is $36.4k, so about 2.5 grand comes out of the dealer. bmw deal is structured around msrp, which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from. if you take out that 2 grand infiniti dealer contribution, prices become similar. in other words you walk into bmw and you can get your price down by a bit, but at infiniti it's probably close to bottom line.add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of  safety  pads, wipers perhaps some other things). i think it's a tie with 328 having sligh acura y lower cost, but  infiniti  being   performance  er and perhaps better equipped).

"sweendogy","November 2011"," i may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership i went for oil changes, wipers and tire rotations. oil changes can be had for 40 bux (sometimes less) at the dealer, rotations another 40 bux - and wipers are 20 bux a year.... now mind you i own the car (not lease), only one driver and i do not hammer it to redline at stop lights. i'm sure many people have had  acura  go thru    safety    during the same timeline but i think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a lit acura e bit more knowing that infiniti would not fix it on the arm. for larger ticket items the bmw prog dodge  sounds great- but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard- hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away.

"dino001","November 2011"," fat chance on those $40. there is no doubt bmw can get expensive at times. i don't kow prices at infininti dealers, but all other lux  car  (incl. lexus or  mercedes ) oil changes are easy north of $100 (it's both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so i find it unlikely infiniti would charge much less. $40 are those mineral oil changes at  chevrolet , ford or toyota, not synthetic. a six pack of synthetic mobil 1 is almost $40 at costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car. to balance, bmw has oil changes every 10-15k miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3k miles changes.btw, infiniti has lease return fees. direc acura y from infiniti website ""disposition fee due at termination of lease"". all lease companies do, no exceptions. they may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand. i get it- you like infiniti. fine, there is a lot to like. just don't oversell it. it is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe. still 40 grand.

"dino001","November 2011"," i  hyundai ed and i was right. this is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on bmw. so it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison. this also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.again,  infiniti  is a good car all i'm saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe. and i know you are not selling - well perhaps just your beliefs  . all i'm doing is to clarify your clarifications, trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks. manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage. doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say. again:1. infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealer's ""participation"" in discount about $2500. lower bmw price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled.2. both have disposal fee.3. bmw pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance. infiniti does not. just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period. add oil changes and some ru toyota er and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy.4. infiniti has better    technology nology nology s and   performance  . bmw has better resale. if you want comparable bmw, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.altogether bmw may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much. in my town bmw dealers are far superior to infiniti in customer service and sale experience.

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," i have (correction, my wife and i have had) twenty-nine audi's, three bmw's and two  volkswagen 's since the mid 1970's. we curren acura y have a 2011 infiniti  infiniti  awd premium and a 2012 acura sh-awd  technology .the acura, upon first test drive (in a day with several test drives over identical routes and   performance  s, etc) was ""close to"" a 2011 audi s4 premium+ without any additional options (that is, it did not have the   performance   vectoring option called sport differential.)many -- myself included -- scoff or repress a scoff (that's me) -- whenever i utter or type those words. but damnit jim, i'm a doctor, not a plumber, no wait, i'm a software guy not a professional car reviewer.but there it is -- a $47,000+ acura  acura  drives and feels pretty much like a potentially $59,000 audi s4 (if they are equipped similarly the audi's price shoots up, big time.) a serious automobile magazine comparison of the two  car  may not convice you that the acura should be shopped against the audi, but the numbers (produced and recorded for both  car ) are not that far apart -- and it feels as if the acura and the audi are twin-sons of different mothers or something akin to that.  design   here:http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_ acura _sh_awd_vs_2010_au- di_s4/viewall.htmlin any case, i was driving a 2009 audi  audi  2.0t prestige w/sport package and 19"" wheels and tires with audi drive select for pete's sake -- and i wanted a new 2012 audi. a reasonably well equipped  audi  (not s4) could be had for about $47,000, so the acura, at the price, seemed a good place to compare.problem was, the audi came back at a 42 month lease point that was much higher than the acura's lease point for 36 months.bzzz. a 4-cyc audi w/211 hp (and it seemed smaller than the acura) vs an acura w/305 hp with every possible do dad that acura throws on these  car ?even the loyalty and ""pull"" of 29 previous audis could not make me cough up the extra money (which would have been about $200 per month).in any case, given an identical deal, i probably would have re-upped for the audi (at the time, in fact, i am certain i would have); but the dollar done me in. hell, at the time, for the exact same money, i probably would have gone for a volvo  volvo  t6 awd with a few option boxes ticked off.now, 5,000 miles later -- i am, i admit it -- very pleased with my decision and love to press down on the accelerator and be rewarded with great   performance   and   performance   delivered as if it were coming from an ultra smooooooth turbine.the acura  acura  sh-awd  technology  may not quite know what it wants to be, but for the time being it is the bargain of the bunch for   performance   and content methinks.still loving the germans, but temporarily on vacation with the japanese.-- markoh yea, drive it like you live. :shades: "
"sweendogy","November 2011"," glad you like the  acura  - seems like a nice rig and for the dollar is abetter buy then a loaded  audi  but here is another review that's not as glowing. http://m.automobilemag.com/reviews/editors_notebook/1106_2012_acura_ acura _sh_awd_ad- - - vance/in subaru .htmlhere is an interesting blurb: ""i appreciate acura's offering a manual transmission in the  acura , but i was not nearly as enamored of it as my colleagues seem to be. perhaps it felt a lit acura e out of place to me because i don't really see acura as a brand for enthusiasts. keep making your  car  heavier, cancel the development of your v-8   performance  , unleash the zdx on the world, and it's no wonder enthusiasts are more interested in bmw, audi, and cadillac these days""this is similar to what i wrote 3 years ago before i got kicked out of a  acura  chat "

"markcincinnati","November 2011"," i have no disagreement with anything either you or the professional reviewer  toyota d -- i have found, after some 5,000 miles however, that the acura is more, er, enthusiastic than i would have, could have, imagined.the overall brand, acura, faces its detractors and challenges. by the time acrua had a v8 in the market, ""everyone"" would be writing ""why bother"" as even bmw and audi are moving to fewer cylinders and blown   performance  s instead of naturally aspirated ones.i give nor take any points away from acura due to its lack of a v8.it remains true, today, however, that acura is typically not considered an enthusiast's brand. some of this perception could change however now that tony stark is getting an acura in the new  dodge 's movie (who'da thunk he'd turn in his r8?) :surprise: "

"
"flightnurse","November 2011"," granted that bmw and mb and audi are downsizing their   performance  s, however you will notice that in their flagship  car , all have a v8 and will stay that way. acrua needs a v8 to stay competitive in that market or drop the rl all together "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," i would assume audi and bmw (and merc, infiniti and lexus, too) will continue to offer v8's -- why not, they already have them and they are good, often great   performance  s.my point is more to the practical notion that ""what was once a v8 is now a 6"" (either i6 or v6) with a turbo, twin-turbo or super- dodge . likewise, we are increasingly seeing these companies moving from a 6 to a 4, also with forced induction.these changes are being done for a variety of reasons, but the one that seems to get press, is they are using smaller ci   performance  s (with forced induction) to improve the car's efficiency (without sacrificing   performance  .)acura may well skirt the ""marketing need"" for more than 6 cylinders by taking the approach of further refining the current 3.7l and then breathing on it, one way or another, to get the hp and   performance   needed for a flagship vehicle.when i was in germany i noted the d class  car  all over the place, but mos acura y with smaller   performance  s (an  audi  with a v6? yep.) maybe acura will pull the covers off of a new ""honda"" v8 and put it in their flagship car (assuming they can muster, or, better  toyota d, want to invest in a complete re-do of the rl.)at this point, i care not -- and i have no idea if i will get another acura.i really like the  acura  in sh-awd  technology  trim -- but a lesser  acura  didn't do it for me; so who knows, maybe the next gen audi (b or c class) will draw me back. in other words, i was passionate about audi's, but i am much less inclined to be thus insofar as the  acura  is concerned.the hell of it is, the acura  acura  sh-awd  technology  is ""more car"" a better performing car (gulp, please forgive me oh ingolstadt gods) and a more efficient car. add to that ""everybody"" says acura's are both reliable and durable (especially when compared with audi's, eh?) ""everybody"" says so, anyway. but this claim, at least, is left to be seen. at 5,000 miles the acura feels ""new"" (actually better than new now that the   performance   is a bit looser); but, so did my last 10 audi's and my wife's last bmw (a 2008 x3 with all the toys on it.)i would tell you my audi's were reliable (for 50,000 miles), but damn, out of warranty they were breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair. i have only an opinion as to their durability, and, well, i assume audi's are simply not as durable as some other  car , once the miles climb well above 50k.so, will acura survive and thrive as an lps or ellps without a v8? beats the heck outta me -- customer's memories are short and most shoppers will probably be unaware of the lack of a v8 offering (if that is what happens) if there is a buttery  comfort ,   performance  ful and  comfort    performance   that responds to the touch of the accelerator. any of these companies is now capable of doing that with 4, 6, 8 or more cylinder   performance  s.acura needs, more than anything, to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up -- the current "" technology "" campaign is pretty good, but the entire product line needs a refresh and to keep and build a marketing campaign that imbues the brand with a positive image. curren acura y, the image, if you asked me, is ""we're the bucky beaver brand"" -- with the exception, perhaps, of the zdx and who knows what the hell that thing is and who it is supposed to ""speak to.""the current  acura  is a band-aid -- the upcoming generation of all of their vehicles needs to refine the styling cues across the board and update the   technology nology nology offered.hopefully the budget and the will to do this becomes evident.in any case, i'm sticking with the ""who cares about offering a v8?"" theme for them.drive it like you live. :shades: "
"billyperksii","November 2011"," sween- its actually e63 amg or the e550. i only have 13k miles on the  acura  with 3yrs of payment to go. the mercedes is not on the radar as yet but you never know when the new car itch sets in- maybe next week.:) "
"flightnurse","November 2011"," no doubt that in germany (europe) you will find d class  car  with 6 cyl's that to me is a given. first time i was in germany (1981) i had a 520i. however we all now that a 520i wouldn't sell here in the us. if i could afford it, our next bmw would be the 740i (will set acura e for a  bmw  for now) with the ( twin turbo i6) to me that is the uber car to have. for less then 3k, that   performance   can make 400hp with no problem (with the factory turbo) and be stone reliable, no need for a v8.the rl has been the problem child for acrua, and why? for me, no flagship car should have a v6 as its only   performance  , and second, the styling doesn't say flagship. yes, we all now the factory;s can make lots of hp from a good 6 cyl but many people want a v8. if i'm off base, i would love to hear why..tony "
"markcincinnati","November 2011"," i think you are on-base for some (perhaps many); but, the number of folks who want a v8 is on the decline. i don't know how long it will take for this decline to be big enough to really make a v8 irrelevant, but i do believe it will, eventually, happen.i believe most folks care more about the way the car feels when the accelerator is pressed down (a lit acura e or a lot.) if the car feels as if it has weapons grade   performance  , is smooooooth and  comfort  (except at full cry), and does not require frequent fill-ups or fill ups that rival a car payment, well what the heck. if the car has a 6 and an electric motor and it is able to meet the requirements noted above -- to hell with what is under the hood.in my observation, which is just that, mine, folks that buy the big buck  comfort   car  (like the  audi  or 7 series, or lexus barges) are often not enthusiasts.i'd take a 5 series for the most fun over a 7, any day -- especially if i were footing the bill to care and feed it.so, no, to repeat, you are not today off base -- but your statement strikes me as being dangerously close to becoming an h toyota orical observation, not a current event for too much longer -- now cut a buck off the price of gas, well, maybe.i remain: often wrong, but never uncertain.drive it like you live. :shades:  "

"Kirstie_H","November 2011"," not everyone can afford to pay cash for each vehicle. however, the key, as in all financial decisions, is to manage your debt. my goal has been to never be upside-down in a vehicle regarding value:debt ratio. why does the amount have to get bigger? i financed my last car for 5 years (due to unknown future financial circumstances) and paid it off in 4. when that was done, i had a nice downpayment that i chose to use to pay for an entire vehicle in cash. my so, on the otherhand, has a vehicle he financed for 5 years, almost 4 years into it and it's almost paid off and he intends to keep it. if you're not upside-down and don't have visions of getting the most you can possibly afford, financing is a reasonable solution to not having the full whack.(stock market was nice to me too, especially ford, which our stock club bought for something like $4 and sold a few months later for $7) "

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," the clunker was a 1990 e30 bmw 325ia coupe. it only had 82,000 miles on it, but was neglected. i had a new radiator put in, a new set of tires, & an alignment. the car drove great as a bmw should, but it had trouble passing new york state inspection. after it passed, the mechanic  toyota d to me that i should either find a donor   performance   or start paying him to rip out things & replace them with new parts. i knew it was time to ""throw the towel in."". cash 4 clunkers came out & i had a 2007 x3 with 38,000 miles (with a year to go & 45k miles allowed for the lease). i loved the 3 series, but it was out of my price range & too small.i drove a mini cooper s w/ a 6   performance   & didn't like it at all. the  infiniti x which i really dig didn't meet the gas mileage requirements for me to get the $3500 credit.i drove by the acura dealer & drove the  acura . i thought it drove like a big, 4 door version of my beloved 2001 honda  honda  type sh. i didn't like the electric   performance   steering, but the car was to be my wife's daily driver. it has a huge trunk, room in the back for child   safety    seat , had thickly bolstered  seat , a great   performance   & transmission combination, transmitted some road feel, i was impressed with the suspension dampening. i bought the car and am extremely happy with it.is a  bmw  a better driver's car?   safety  olutely. is the  infiniti  a balanced    performance    road rocket? you bet.is my  acura  75-80% of those  car  on public roads? i certainly think so.

"kdshapiro","December 2011"," leasing a car is like renting an apartment. neither is bad and both have their place. buying on credit is a personal decision.but one has to be responsible whether it is a house, car, work of art, etc. and i don't think people spend money irresponsibly to keep up with the jones'. people just spend money irresponsibly. just   design   at the foreclosures. "
"dino001","December 2011"," you're right, there can be many motivations. ""keeping up"" is just one of possibilities. a lot of it may not be linked to particular jones's, but rather to media image of a successful person. when you   design  ed at life  design  s of characters from many shows and compare with real-life earnings   performance   of their jobs, there is often a large disconnect. however, many people would take that as a validation for their acquisitions. and of course commercials.  design  ing on lease - it's not the lease itself that is a giveaway, it's the terms. if somebody leases at 0 down for mileage they are actually driving then that's a choice, when they put 4 grand down, 10k miles/year and their commute is 15 miles each way, you know that having car on the driveway was more important that actually driving it. don't get me wrong - it's their money (or in some cases - it's their not having the money) and their choice to make. but if they wanted to borrow 10 bucks from me, i would automatically assume the likely actual choice here is losing 10 bucks or losing their graces.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," a friend of mine frequen acura y uses the phrase: ""there's no replacement for displacement."" he is appalled at the number of  car  that may offer more than 6 cylinders but rarely sell (or stock) anything other than ""blown"" i4's, i6's or v6's (both naturally aspirated and forced induction.)i tell him that there is a replacement for displacement and that it is ""volumetric efficiency.""the 211hp 258 pound feet i4 in my 2009  audi  was both quick and   performance   -- with a 6spd automatic; in the new  audi 's the   performance  's rating remains but the car is even quicker,   performance  er and more efficient due to an 8spd automatic. in favor of the v8 s4, audi switched to a super-charged v6; in the s8 audi has elected to drop 2 cylinders (from 10 to 8) and produce an   performance   that is both more efficient and more   performance  ful -- considering its size the s8 is a sipper, not a guzzler.only one acura   performance   is boosted (the i4 in the  acura ), and as far as i know there are no infiniti   performance  s that are either super or turbo charged.the v6 in my 2012 acura is, frankly, pretty much a basic (but buttery  comfort ) fuel injected v6 of the    technology nology nology  era. i was wondering what would happen if acura (honda) would change to fsi (fuel stratified injection) and super or turbo charge it? seems to me that with very lit acura e effort the   performance   used today if brought to the current state of the blown art, would put out at least 20% more hp and 10% more   performance   all the while showing perhaps another +2 mpg's. then, if they would upgrade the fine 6   performance   auto to a current gen 8   performance  , any acura so blessed would go from its current potency (which is very good and is, at this time, acura's most   performance  ful   performance   [the 3.7, i.e.]) to high output potency -- in the   performance   department -- coupled with always being near or at the operating sweet spot due to the increase in the number of gears.think if infiniti, curren acura y without any forced induction   performance   offerings, were to begin offering their   performance  s with a super or turbo  dodge  (and also keeping their 7   performance   autos) -- makes my head spin.the germans (and even the  cadillac -v) would have something more to worry about, with all these g's, m's,  acura 's and rl's armed for bear.will acura or infiniti ever up their   performance   game to this level, or will they take down-tuned   performance  s and alter their breathing and computer maps to get them sligh acura y better than they are now with a touch more grunt in the 0-60 dept? btw, infiniti already has a v8, so its creds don't need much   performance  ering brain-  performance   to at least be able to claim ""we have v8's"" even as they are bested by their very own 6's and 4's.i used to assume the car mfgrs read the engthusiasts magazines and the postings here on edmunds and elsewhere. but, apparentely they don't. if they did and if they were swayed by what is  toyota d in both places, well you think they would pay attention and respond (even if only a lit acura e bit) to some of the legitmate crit toyota ues made by the authors.audi and bmw are unlikely to loose credibility from a ""sporting intentioned"" family perspective. if someone want's to be certain their car hails from a lineage that includes ""winners"" and a widely accepted high   performance   heritage,   design   no further.acura, perhaps standing all alone, may be shooed from the ellps (a.k.a. premium) board and ""chat room"" based on its h toyota oric but curren acura y all but gone lack of  ford . yet the perception that acura is a bit fuzzy in the perception of premium department remains for them. the zdx certainly didn't help and allowing the rl to, more or less, atrophy away hasn't helped either. of all of these car brands, acura is in the most peril of losing its way.infiniti and lexus are mos acura y safe bets to perservere as players in the ellps and lps field, from what i can tell (although lexus seems much more the  comfort  choice than the   performance   choice, but they are doing a yeoman's job to make this perception go away somewhat.)mercedes, too, a safe bet if what you really want is a bonafide member of the lps club.volvo is, for the most part, doing what i think acrua should do -- and that is building a   performance   image to go hand-in-hand with their   safety   image. they are about in the same position as acura, the primary difference is volvo seems to be really trying to put on a   performance   face these days.finally the iconic american brand, cadillac, has demonstrated, these past 3 - 5 years, a penchant for creating an image that may not quite be able to stand toe-to-toe with bmw or mercedes, for example, but they do keep sneaking up on it with ever more interesting   design  s and   performance   plants -- including volumetrically enhanced (super-charged) models like the  cadillac -v.we are in a time of inflection -- 2013 model  car  are right around the corner and they continue to excite and delight (with the possible exception of acura). so here i sit a guy with a h toyota ory of 29 audi's, 3 bmw's, 3  volkswagen 's and 1 acura -- wondering why in the hell i got the acura. but, truth be told, the acura is not a boring drive, quite the contrary in fact; however, it is somewhat boring to   design   at and, that more than anything, may be the crux of the matter. :confuse: "
"dino001","December 2011"," new fuel efficiency standards pushed german manufacturers into new areas of smaller blown   performance  s. it's probably both us and euro driven. i don't think bmw is going i4 turbo because they want to. they do it because they have to.it makes me wonder if lack of such moves on part of lexus, infiniti and acura is because they are considered parts of their parent companies' fleets. if this is the case, it would give them d toyota inct advantage, as lux customer doesn't care about fuel efficiency to same extent as non- comfort . it's not completely non-issue, but it is not a big one.

"
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," the  acura  should only be sold in awd trim, imho.  honda ing to my ohio dealers, most of the  acura 's sold are   technology nology  sh-awd's anyway. i think acura should do what audi does in the us -- sell awd  car  (99% anyway) period.content and price them with options and packages that make sense, but don't push massive amounts of   technology nology nology in one package. in other words, offer a basic version of the  car  (but only in awd trim.) sh-awd is damn near magic, it totally transforms the basic fwd car into a really believable ellps car. my dealers claim they sell mos acura y  acura 's anyway, so acura already seems to have at least the possibility of being all awd all the time like audi.with the fwd models clouding the message, it seems acura's sometimes are more like  volkswagen 's than audis, yet acura has essentially stated it wants to be in the premium class and that it wants to model itself on audi.i assume this makes sense since  volkswagen  begat audi and honda begat acura. audi morphed (in the us) to the "" audi "" company and claims to be the reigning champeen of awd  car  (with the most h toyota ory, don't you know?) audi has essentially eschewed fwd  car  (in north america) in favor of awd  car  in order to be taken seriously as a contender in the premium class -- where only rwd and awd are taken seriously, it's in all the papers.acura keeps hanging on to its honda roots where it's good and where it's not so good, premium perception-wise. audi, morphed from fwd to fwd and/or awd to awd, period. they entered and won contests and races and wards awards and other awards, but these awards and the spoils of winning were all accomplished with their awd versions. although i guess you could buy an fwd  audi  or  audi , i don't know where you go to actually find one in the flesh for sale at a dealer.and audi did wonder ""how much   performance   can one put throught the front wheels"" -- its answer was ""not enough, so we need to put more   performance   through the front and rear wheels."" and they are where they are now by taking the risk of virtually dropping fwd from the na market.and what happened next? bmw brought out the 325 (in 1988 (?) as i recall, since i had one) with awd; then mercedes started offering awd here and there. acura, infiniti, lexus, volvo,  volkswagen , cadillac, buick and, and, and, the l toyota  goes on to cover every lps and lps wannabe brand and product. as to the price impact -- i think it would be pretty easy to keep the price of an all sh-awd fleet at about the current fwd models + $1,500; for the   safety   and   performance   this would offer, to say nothing of an image enhancement similar to that which audi enjoyed, it is probably not a show stopper for the company.and, most of us shopping in this class will probably not reject a new acura that is exclusively offered with sh-awd. for most, it ought to be a no-brainer.i have nothing against fwd, btw, i just think it would be very helpful to acura if it has the goal of remaining a serious premium class brand, to completely ditch any and all fwd offerings from its lineup.  :surprise: "

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," if my message somehow went too far, i apologize -- i do not believe that moving to an all awd line-up (or 99%, as in the case of audi -- and in the case of audi it is 100% of their advertising) will alone re-position acura in the minds of the intended customers.as i mentioned in my earlier post, the crux of the issue is not how these  car  drive (if the 2012  acura   technology  sh-awd is any indicator), they are not a boring drive, not an incompetent drive, nor lacking in   performance  . the thing is the  car  are pretty much not very attractive -- even if they do get bonus points for trying to   design   different.they have the driving thing in pretty good   design   as far as i'm concerned -- they need to    technology nology nology ize the   performance  s and   design   at the content that is offered by every car brand/product they wish to emulate and be guided  honda ingly.they need to consider making themselves perceived solely as an awd company and they need an across the board styling transplant or upgrade asap.probably more than any other step they could take, styling is the one that will bear the most fruit. for, no matter how much they up their game in the   performance   or content arena, people need something to draw them to the showroom and something to feel good about after they buy.my '12  acura  is ""better"" in so many ways than my '09  audi  -- which was the first year for the change to the b8 platform for audi. i would not expect this to remain thus -- a refreshed  audi , most likely, will again be more attractive (in all the above ways) than the current  acura  (from a   design   perspective mainly.)you don't have to agree with the magazines, but the current  audi , which   design  s very much like a larger b8,  audi , is winning friends, awards wise. no acura is on any l toyota  i can find. bmw, too, remains a repeat top choice amongst those who award wins for being great.acura simply needs a   design  -ectomy, soon. :sick: "

"dino001","December 2011"," i still rather have na straight 6. perhaps if (when) gas goes to 5-6 buck a gallon, i'll change my mind. i basically decided to jump in and get one before new 328, exac acura y because of the four cylinder replacing base six in 328 (got the wagon, so no  bmw  on that, plus 50k+ after some options still too much for me). boy, what a sweet machine - drove it in germany on autobahn, got to 138 mph before traffic stopped me. now waiting for delivery in spartanburg - probably in january. don't care about lower gas mileage, don't care about lower weight, higher   performance  /  performance  . i just wanted that na straight six - it's probably one of the best   performance  s in the h toyota ory. and i bet bmw would never have changed, if not for the new cafe.i had enough four cylinder turbos - 2002  subaru  and 2008  subaru  sti, which are boxers, inheren acura y better configurations that straight four.   performance  , great    performance   , in some aspe cadillac  may better than 328 (allows   performance  er corner entry and maintains that   performance   throughout). still - i just wanted more ""adult"" car than my sti, was ready to give up some   performance   and even some    performance   . to me bmw  bmw  was always about two things: weight d toyota ribution (50/50) and straight six. the 328 i just bought had   design   that is just ok, but it   design  s like it was   design  ed thirty minutes before the car was to be released - give some nice leather and wood inlays, add dashboard from 1989 and you're done. the car overcomes that in those mechanical aspe cadillac , but take of of them away and other choices become very compelling. audis are so much better   design  ing(by a mile) both inside and out, have better equipment, cheaper. or being a lit acura e on frugal side, i may get even lower to  acura  (not sure about that, but would give it a try) or even volvo v50. to me bmw voluntarily gave up something they had over their competition. they better make it up in other areas - or else.

"qbrozen","December 2011"," not all   performance  s are created equal, though. you can't condemn all 4-cyl turbos based on your subaru experience. the turbo boxer 4 is actually quite coarse compared to, say, the 2 liter  volkswagen  turbo. that same 2 liter is also  comfort er and much more flexible than volvo's i5 turbo. so you should really withold judgegment until you try it.

"dino001","December 2011"," that's not what i meant. actually subaru boxers are great. exhaust note is almost as intoxicating as that on the bmw's six. but i have not met i4 that i was impressed with. to me they all sound like sewing machines. they may be quiter (some) or more   performance  ful than those from subaru (not many, esp. sti), but it usually comes with high cost (counterweight balance shafts). boxer is naturally balanced, just like straight six and offers low cg. no, i'd rather have the h4, or even i5 before i would get i4. but more important - i got i6, which is what all i wanted for now. :shades: "

"markcincinnati","December 2011","  honda ing to the web-zine, winding road: their review of the new i4 turbo makes me feel that one would not feel slighted having a bmw with this motor, quite the contrary. their comments about the new larger 3 series, also encouraging. "
"shipo","December 2011"," agreed. all else being equal i'd opt for a normally aspirated i6 over a blown i4, however, all else ain't even close to being equal. specifically: - the i4 turbo has more maximum   performance   and   performance  , and a substantially wider/flatter   performance   band. - the i4 turbo weighs significan acura y less than the i6 which will aid in    performance    and fuel economy. - the i4 turbo is shorter (albeit wider by virtue of the turbo and its requisite plumbing) than the i6, and as such is easier to package which should in turn make service easier. - the i4 turbo returns significan acura y better fuel economy.this is not to discount the fact that i6 motors are naturally balanced and have virtually no   performance   re nissan l events (of which there are two for every rotation of a 4-cylinder/4-stroke   performance  ), and as such are naturally  comfort er both in operation and in   performance   delivery. that  toyota d, the portion of the roughness of an i4 which is attributable to the   performance  's natural imbalance is a) relatively minor due to its 2.0 liter displacement (the threshold beyond which balance shafts become increasingly necessary), and are easily cancelled via a relatively small/light weight set of balance shafts.long story short, take a drive in a late model  volkswagen  or  audi  (or  audi  or  audi ) 2.0t and try and find something objectionable about the   performance   delivery vis-?-vis a late model  bmw . i've now had two i6  bmw ; the   performance   in my wife's new  volkswagen  is easily on par with the unit installed in both of my mounts from munich.

blasphemy!if you've taken back to back to back test drives --over the identical route, playing the identical cd on the sound  technology  and pushing the  car  into corners at identical   performance  s -- you will understand how it is possible to see  car  you might only have test driven for a lark in a whole new light.standouts in the entire bunch (w/o regard to price): the  acura , s4,  audi , bmw 335 w/x-drive, the  bmw 7x w/  technology nology nology package, and the  volvo  t6. the  cadillac  and the cc get a ""quite nice"" rating. if money were no object, i'd probably go for the  audi  prestige or s4 w/sport differential (think of that as the german sh-awd -- aka   performance   vectoring.) if money were really no object, i'd probably wait for the upcoming audi s8 and learn to smoke cigars and swill cognac or grappa.money being an object, i narrowed my choices down a bit, but was able to strongly consider an  bmw 7x (due to fantastic lease deals) and a '12 audi  audi  2.0t prestige w/sport pkg. i also considered the volvo but found them totally unwilling to budge off of sticker (or $1,000 off.) just because the '12  acura  sh-awd  technology  was the sleeper of the bunch (in terms of   performance  ), priced right (at $47,000 as i wanted it) and had enjoyed the automobile s4 vs  acura  comparison article, i kept it on my l toyota .well cut off my legs and call me shorty -- the  acura  came in at 87% of msrp, a low money factor and no-wait for it to be shipped from europe (it is made here in ohio) -- no other car even came close to the ""value"" the  acura  presented.i, at the time, one time (so far), turned my back on audi and took the plunge into a non-german car. the acura  acura  does not blow me away like the s4 or  audi , for instance. yet, like some wines, the  acura  does seem to be impressing me more as it ""ages"" (miles). i do not consider it to be an audi s4 clone, even though the automobile article is very complimentary of the  acura 's   performance   vs the audi's. the  acura  is, as i have written elsewhere, ""close to fine"" (as if ""fine"" is a destination.)i now am at a place where i will probably consider acura again based on my current experience. yet the recent press releases about the upcoming acura line-up is a cause for concern. they seem to be saying, ""we're giving up on being a tier-1 premium car company."" time will tell.if you have not test driven (i.e., a good long test drive) the  acura   technology  sh-awd (and only the  technology  sh-awd, not the lesser configurations, and certainly not the fwd version, period) and you are   design  ing to purchase a new car from the ellps line-up, i do encourage you to take the long test drive -- even if the somewhat beaky styling puts you off -- of the  acura   technology  sh-awd, back to back to back with the  car  you are more seriously considering. what can it hurt?the  acura 's styling may be too much for you to overcome and perhaps the price i got was a fluke or a once in a lifetime deal -- hence the  acura  will remain unattractive to you no matter how impressively it may perform. perhaps too, you are a cash buyer and then the volvo may merit more consideration (i was interested in the lowest lease price i could get and the acura's discount and money factor were compelling.)in any case, as i have  toyota d, what could it hurt to spend a day test-flogging, or, test-driving three or four very nice  car , including, just for the fun of it, the acura  acura   technology  sh-awd.drive it like you live. often wrong, but never uncertain,mark :shades: "

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," so my driving a  acura  v6 (no   technology nology  pkg) loaner car has got me thinking about our board's acura debate, argument, disagreement, thing. the  acura  v6 has got some guts to it. i don't think it gives up that much fuel economy compared to my 4cyl. i do feel the extra 200 pounds in the nose though.acura's lineup right now has too much overlapping. there is a mere $885 difference between the  acura  v6 w/   technology nology  pkg (a small percentage of  acura  sales) & a  acura  w/   technology nology  pkg (fwd). the difference between a  acura  (fwd, no   technology nology  pkg) & a  acura  (4cyl) w/   technology nology  pkg is $2695.sween & mark have both made some excellent points regarding the  acura , the  acura , & the future of acura.here's what i have to say:acura wants to be a sport/ comfort  division of honda. the  acura  is a good entry level starting point. ditch the 4cyl & make the  acura  v6 the base model. acura constan acura y offers $4000 incentives on the v6 model anyway, so just make that the base   performance  . offset the nose heaviness with acura's sh awd.now this is easy for me to say. it does have some  problem  though. the  acura  v6 w/   technology nology  pkg weighs in at 3680 lbs. add another 241 lbs for acura's sh awd  technology . you've got a grand total of 3921 lbs. that's a big pill to swallow for sween who thinks the base  acura  is too heavy.the other problem about making sh awd available on the  acura  is its cost. $3550 per car is what acura charges now on a  acura .i really do love mark's idea of making sh awd standard across the line. more on this later.

"kyfdx","December 2011"," probably in the 15% who actually have rwd... in this area, the vast majority of  bmw  sold are awd..the local infiniti dealer doesn't even stock a rwd version of any model, if it is available in awd... so, no rwd versions of  infiniti   sedan , etc.. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," i agree that a large majority of folks probably don't know if their 2wd  car  are front or rear drive. i believe that folks who buy awd are aware that all four wheels are driven -- they may or may not know if the bias is f or r, however.with virtually every audi and bmw now or soon to be not naturally aspirated and likely 2 cylinders less than previously, i suspect many folks won't know if their  audi  or 3 series or  audi  or 5 series is a 6 or an 8 (respectively.)the fuel costs are probably more noticed than the # of cylinders.it may not be accurate for the whole country, but the audi, bmw, infiniti, mercedes and volvo dealers (and the sales of  cadillac  cadillacs) sales are -- well over 50% awd these days (speaking as one from sw ohio.) the infinity dealer, in fact, sells some 90% of the ex, fx and m class vehicles as awd (i suspect the same is true of the g's, i have simply not bothered to check on them).awd for the non-pur toyota , non-high-  performance   buyer is the   performance   option. and, of course, the two local audi dealers basically only sell  audi s, to those in the know and those who don't care, period.we long-time audi mavens also believe that  audi  is the   performance   set-up, wet or dry. locally, i can't recall the last time i saw more than a few rwd bimmer's either (but remember we are talking about sw ohio where we ""sometimes"" have a snow fall that lingers more than 24 hours.)i have taken (four times) the audi driving experience in seefeld, austria and (once) the bmw x-drive school (here in the us -- in south  mazda ina), and although the ""pur toyota s"" who attend do proclaim rwd is the best, even they admit that bmw's are not very much fun on anything other than dry pavement, hence their purchase of an x-drive bmw and their attendance at the bmw x-drive school.overall, even the driving instructors (in both schools) are converts to awd and   performance   vectoring rear diffs, since we all drive our  car  on both normal and low coefficient of friction surfaces often in the same day. in the ideal world, so many speak of, ""rwd rules,"" but perhaps since it ""never rains in southern california"" rwd  car  are seen as handfuls for the prolet honda t (those not living in socal.) in terms of preferences then, it seems that a lot of (the majority) folks -- if given the choice (and care) will opt for awd, fwd and rwd in that order.of course, to be crystal clear, i am speaking from the point of reference of those who care to comment who live in sw ohio, se indiana and northern kentucky.drive it like you live.

"billyperksii","December 2011"," sween-first, you own a  pontiac 5 and i never seen you post any news or updates about infiniti- always pounding about acura this acura that. next you keep emphasing about acura's sales and their survival. i never once seen or heard of any acura dealership in trouble or on the brink of bankruptcy. infiniti should kiss the ring on ghosen finger because they nearly went out of business several years back.secondly, all car manufacturers offer incentives to move their inventory-the best of the best- audi, mecerdes, bwm. so scrap that thought process.third, i see tons of  audi , e350, 3series and ml as loaner vechicles, so again your point with the about the  acura  been offered as loaner just does not mean anything.can you let us know what is the latest news on the infiniti produ cadillac , try to sway some of us acura loyal toyota  over to the dark side. "
"markcincinnati","December 2011"," in my garage are two  car , one acura and one infiniti. for over twenty years that would have read two audis; then for six years that read one audi and one bmw. my wife and i have had twenty-nine audis, three bmw's and two  volkswagen 's.prying german  car  out of our hands was a major accomplishment for the two japanese mfgrs noted above in the first sentence.the latest news on infiniti produ cadillac  pertains to the new jx crossover. but if you are an enthusiast this vehicle will hardly light your candle. fwd bias, cvt transmission and a sub-300 hp 3.5l v6. although the vehicle impresses visually (and yes i'll grant that is subjective) and has gobs of passenger room, it strikes me as infiniti's acadia. yawn.i have been searching for an update to the ""aging"" (my words) g line, but have found nothing that even smells like a future product direction. i would hope, however, that the g grows in width to, say,  audi  dimensions. it strikes me as a bit odd that the  acura  from acura has a shorter wheelbase than either the  audi  or the  infiniti , but only the g feels c dodge ped inside. if i can sit in the driver's seat and reach across to the passenger's window, i feel the vehicle is too narrow (for its length) in the ellps class. the  audi  has grown in wheelbase, length and width (with a slight increase in  comfort ), as has the upcoming bmw 3 -- and the  acura  is damn near 5 series or  audi  size. the g, for me, makes me feel like a bug.when i get behind the wheel of a g, i feel like i did the first time i got into a ford econoline van, i mean i feel like i am sitting on the front bumper.now, the infiniti in my garage is a 2011  infiniti  premium in black gloss with a java   design  . i feel like i am  honda ing the hulk when i drive it. it feels big,   performance  ful, broad shouldered and nimble all at the same time. i also got that feeling from my many test drives of an  bmw 7x. i would have had an m were it not for the requirement to buy a $3,000 option package just to get blind spot warning.i would suspect lit acura e will change for a few more years in the m's, since they are only 2 my old. the corporate grill that has been added to the fx's makes me believe that the fx line will be refreshed perhaps in '13 or '14 my. and, i assume the g's are due for a refresh in less than or equal to 24 months.driving audis,  bmw  and infinitis, i can tell you that the phrase japanese bmw is an appropriate descriptive term for infiniti. infiniti seems to be striving for that certain something that makes a bmw stand out. acura, based on my limited experience with the brand, on the other hand, seems to be -- sort of, kind of, er, a lit acura e bit like -- the japanese audi (from a few years ago) in that they don't hide their honda-ness any better than audi used to hide its  volkswagen  parentage. if acura were to ditch the honda ""tells"" asap and make the acura brand ""stand alone"" (as audi has done from  volkswagen ), they would be making great strides in establishing some kind of un toyota ue brand identity (which is largely lacking, curren acura y.)of course, it also wouldn't hurt one lit acura e bit if acura would hire a   design  er or three away from one of the companies that make real purty 'sheens.hardly the ""latest news"" since it is difficult to get news out of infiniti from any reliable source, but, that's it!merry chr toyota mas, happy holidays, etc.drive it like you live. :shades: "

"billyperksii","December 2011"," mark, i dont just bla toyota er about a car and read some article in a magazine. i actually test drove the  pontiac 5x for an extensive time. the salesperson actually gave me the keys and  toyota d have fun but be careful.i wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003  acura  type s, the g just did not do it for me, i tried to force myself to like it but i just knew it would have been buyers remorse.here are the deal breakers and i have  toyota d this many a times-1).too c dodge p (mazda millennia   design   size)2). intrusive growl (could get annoying a long road trips)3). i just felt beat up after the test drivei have nothing against the brand, maybe the next generation g will sway me but from what i seen with the new styling cues on the m, g coupe and fx-i think i will step on my accelerator when i go by an infiniti dealership.

"sweendogy","December 2011"," finally some substance. i agree the g could be a lit acura e c dodge ped when compared to a  acura  or buick- infact there have been complaints from bigger drivers that the  car   seat  are a problem. the growl is something that older folks have also complained about- the coupe does have a very intense growl when pushed in the  honda . the 07 and 08s  sedan  for sure also make sounds - this is something that can be heard when screeching from red light to red light bit not at 70mph on the highway- the newer  infiniti  sedan has toned down the rear sound to make it more of a  chrysler  and to accommodate the older folks who complained. as i type im getting ready for an 800 mile was coast tour which i'm dreading because we are not taking my g- we have to take my wifes  honda  because its roomier- the g is not a problem at all on long trips, i mean it's not a 89 covrvette - its a great highway  chrysler  when asked.styling is subjective so can't argue.

"nyccarguy","December 2011"," the original is300 was a great 1st entry into this segment. razor sharp    performance    & excellent    safety   . it's 215 horse  performance   i6 was outgunned by the bmw e46  bmw  (and then by the 330i) and it got not so great fuel economy (and this is when gas was cheap). lexus owners complained about the ""rough ride."". lexus brought the car in to compete with bmw's e36, but the e46 was already on its way by the time the is300 hit our shores. they brought brass knuckles to a gun fight.they brought the 300 hp is 350 (automatic only). toyota corporate v6. 0-60 in the mid 5s instead of the low 7s.    safety    that provided excellent stopping d toyota ance, but with not much pedal feel. lexus was very high on their 300 hp number vs. 255 in bmw's recen acura y released e90 330i.i drove the lexus is350 back to back with a 330i at their event. the lexus out accelerated the bmw, but just felt very artificial compared to the very athletic bmw.the is250 had no   performance  . the problem with the is350 was that only a year after its release was sent packing by bmw's n54 twin turbo 300 hp i6. i think lexus is waiting to see the next 3 series to finalize the next is. they might just hit one out this time.

"savetheland","December 2011"," all main honda   car  are pretty boring so i   design  ed at premium sector. i can hardly call it  comfort   car  since any sub-prime mortgage holder can afford one, so if you are rich consider something different.bmw  bmw  - the best   performance  er car in segment.  toyota able, crisp, precise, good steering ans so on. as some say - fits as a glove. the only problem i had with it - unnaturally heavy steering at parking lot   performance  s, compact size and small trunk. it is a personal   performance   sedan, not luxurious but worth every penny. it is more expensive than other  car  because of   performance  ering effort went into its   design  . cadillac  - pretty refined except of   performance  . steering is the most balanced in the group, good    performance    and unlike infinity -  toyota able and is not c dodge ped. next choice it you do not want bmw.infinity g-series - i felt like i do not belong to   design   - difficult to find  toyota able position. good    performance   , good transmission and   performance   and steering is very good also but ride is too harsh. i felt like beaten up after test drive. if you are going to commute every day - it is not for you - you will get tired soon. unlike bmw it achieved good    performance    not because of superior   performance  ering but because of making it harsh. it might be more reliable though than both  cadillac  and bmw.buick  buick  - steering is very light - like in acura - but unlike acura it is precise.   performance   is week and   design   is high quality but not luxurious. may be not as reliable as acura though. but it is certainly better handler and has considerably better steering. reliability might be a concern - it after all is a german car made by gm. acura  - steering is numb, numb, numb. i felt scary because lack of any feedback from steering wheel.   performance   is certainly better than in buick. ride is  toyota able but does not feel as solid as in buick. might be reliable though but keep it mind troublesome transmission - honda is famous for   performance  s but have problematic transmissions. lincoln  - it is a  ford . it feels like  ford ,   design  s like  ford  and has too many cheap bits in   design   like  ford . i did not ins toyota  in seriously testing it. i will wait to see new 2012 to make final judgement.audi  audi  - it is superior to both  acura  and  buick  and i suspect new  ford / lincoln  too. has to buy awd version to really enjoy it. but reliability over years proved to be disastrous. as with all  volkswagen s i know that after warranty expires there will be a lot of very expensive repairs. no matter how i like it and i always liked it very much - it is not practical car for working people who have to make living by commuting to work every day. it may work if you lease until warranty expires. i wish i was a rich dude, but i am not - my money are hard earned. btw i would prefer audi to bmw.

"markcincinnati","December 2011"," i have to assume that awd is in the  hyundai  pipeline. i suspect they need another year or two to refine their ""house made"" 8-spd transmission. from what i read it is a notch lower in refinement to the ones used by audi and bmw.btw, is it true that infiniti sources its 7-spd from mercedes? and, is it true that the first year the 7-spd had some software  problem  but that they have since been corrected?our late 2010 build 2011  infiniti  awd has the 7-spd and it has presented zero  problem  and zero recalls in 18,000+ miles. the only thing i do notice about the  infiniti 's ""character"" is that the   performance   makes coarser sounds than the acura 3.7l   performance  , but this trait is really only evident at very high rpm's and/or when the accelerator is floored. it should be improved by infiniti, no doubt, as the infiniti   performance   refinement is not quite up to audi, bmw or even, honda, er acura smoooothness.

"fedlawman","December 2011"," i optioned both  car  the way you l toyota ed in your post (#12838):""price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers.""i then explained that i don't like leather seating or 18"" wheels and that the mercedes i would personally order costs $41,450. so, how is it on me that infiniti bundles key    technology nology nology s within bloated and overpriced packages? they do it on purpose to force the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they don't want. do you think it's an accident that in order to get the sport package, you also have to order the navigation package? that's $4000 for a laundry l toyota  of stuff you probably don't need and wouldn't have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your  infiniti  to handle and stop a lit acura e better. :confuse: so, if i were to buy a  infiniti , i would have to pass on the sport package and simply get the  dodge  + premium package for $39,245. that's only $2000 less than the mercedes. every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the  infiniti  (which is it's strongest asset) has been significan acura y diminished.so how did this happen? mercedes offers the c350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. this serves the customer - if the customer doesn't want leather or 18"" wheels, they don't have to buy them. yes, if you want metallic paint on a european car, you have to pay for it, but at least you don't have to order the shiatsu massage and curb feeler packages to get it.and enough with the annoying ""left lane"" remark. in this era of 300 hp family  car  and 400 hp  hyundai   car , 328 hp is nothing to brag about. if you really spend that much time in the left lane, i hope you have the decency to check your rearview mirror often. :p "

"dino001","December 2011"," mb and bmw are more expensive for comparable equipment. one could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to g or  acura , as long as they can let go some of those luxuries. however, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and c-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon). there is really no excuse for that - 12k kia and hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse. it's all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" bs. i know, i have 328 - fortunately it's a wagon, so it has folding  seat  and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. what makes it worse, i see dealers actually ordering those without folding  seat  in large numbers. i can only imagine a brand new owner of 50k 335 trying to fold his/her  seat  and discovering the car doesn't have it. :sick: :lemon: on many other options, i'm more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling). i tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or v honda ble   performance   steering), but bundling sports package with nav is a lit acura e too much, even if i would order both anyway. to me it's ok to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all   technology nology , or all sports. but cross-bundling does sound a lit acura e like making a run on customer's wallet, even if some customers would take them both. for value-oriented people probably nothing beats acura - you get everything except nav/  technology nology nology. i like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose :lemon:. we still don't have it so bad here - you would have to see a price sheet on bmw in europe - it's actually a book!!! proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional. of course, they also have three times as many   performance   versions, which creates many more permutations, but that's a different story entirely. not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50k+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there).

"fedlawman","January 2012"," fwiw, i don't have a personal stake or emotions tied to this discussion because i don't own any of the  car  in this segment. also, i can research (and maybe eventually purchase) a boring   volkswagen   or subaru  subaru  for my wife without craving more excitement because i already own an honest sports car that gives me more driving and ownership pleasure than any car in this segment ever could.m-b c350 standard    technology nology nology s missing on the  infiniti   dodge :*sport suspension with electronic control adaptive dampers*adaptive    safety    with predictive  safety  priming, auto  safety  drying, and hill start ass toyota *14 way   performance   driver seat with   performance   lumbar adjust*  performance   steering column*driver memory with settings for seat, mirrors, and steering column*auto dim rearview and driver outside mirror*moonroof*wood trim  hyundai s*rain sensing automatic wipers*split-fold rear  seat *harman kardan logic 7 450 watt audio*9   safety   including pelvis and knee   safety  *attention ass toyota  to detect driver drowsiness infiniti   dodge  standard    technology nology nology s missing on the c350:*xenon headlamps*leather  seat *keyless start*free metallic paintplease let me know if i've missed anything... so, my assertion that the  infiniti  lacks quite a few    technology nology nology s seems to be valid. but more importan acura y, did you notice that most of the c350    technology nology nology s are   performance   or   safety   related while the  infiniti     technology nology nology s are basically fluff? but to even things up as accurately as possible, let's load them both up as closely as we can...so, a c350 with added xenon headlamps, leather  seat , navigation, metallic paint, 18"" wheels, and keyless start costs $46,440.now, a  infiniti   dodge  with wood trim, premium package, navigation package, and sport package costs $45,045.it   design  s like the mercedes is $1400 more expensive than the  infiniti . but the  infiniti  still lacks electronic adaptive suspension, adaptive    safety   , and attention ass toyota . also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams, curve ass toyota  and headlamp washers, split-fold rear  seat , knee and pelvis   safety  , and rain-sensing wipers.the c350 lacks dvd playback, zagat rest saturn nt guide, aluminum pedals, magnesium shift paddles, and a viscous limited slip.draw your own conclusions - i'm exhausted... :sick: "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," i discovered an error in my research. i'm not sure what i did, but the above described c350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440.

"markcincinnati","January 2012"," maybe it is just the congestion caused by all the high-school and college students home for the break, but here in our somewhat small  honda , cincinnati, it is approaching impossible to be able to actually drive (meaning the car is moving at a   performance   higher than 20mph) unless one seeks a rural route.now, me, i go to and from work 5 days per week, travel the 200 mi rt between cincinnati and columbus once per week and sleep late the other day. i do not (and really don't plan to) ""track"" my car (never have).so i go through german and now japanese "" comfort    performance    sedan "" one after another -- ordering upsized wheels/tires, sport packages, sport  seat , sport suspensions, whatever has sport in it. i used to fight the good fight and order  car  specifically so that i could get manual shifters. i chipped my turbo  car , changed out the air filters and bpv's to squeeze out any additional   performance   i could (from the turbo's of course).for what?a quick dash to 35mph, before i had to abrup acura y mash the  safety  pedal or rear end the guy parked on the highway in front of me! that's what.i read the reviews of the new bmw 328 (with the turbo 4), and i really got excited (for about 9 minutes) when i saw the   performance   figures -- but then i thought, ""i probably can't even use that much   performance   on the entrance  dodge p to i-71s"" (i'd rear end someone.)nevertheless i continue to want more -- i want my  car  to be ever quicker (they're already   performance  , even the puny ones can go 130mph, which is where many of the germans place the ""limiter"") even though it is hard to imagine regularly (or frequen acura y) being able to enjoy the ever quickening   performance   from the americans, europeans and the japanese.i want ever larger and sticky-er tires, firmly sprung and electronically controlled suspensions, the whole enchilada -- and for what, the one time i can carve that corner (without fear of hitting a deer in the headlights -- literally bambi.)i have become irrational about the   performance   -- i want more more more, whereas traffic and circumstances of urbania and even sub-urbania allow less less less -- of the  car  i drive. perhaps that is why my fondest memory (and my all-time favorite car) is of a 1995 audi s6. at least, way back then, i could actually slip the car into first gear and rapidly release the clutch and floor the accelerator without rear-ending the guy in front of me being my first and foremost thought.now i am driving a car that is as   performance   as any on this board and   performance  er than many. moreover, the thing is capable of holding its own in quickness too. good luck in being able to actually enjoy the   performance  .yet, with 31 months to go on the lease, i am wondering -- what will be quicker, sticky-er and have more   technology nology nology next time?completely irrational.i'm thinkin' the evolution of the new bmw 3 (in the next 30 months) or the g from infiniti (and possibly another acura) or maybe back to my old love, audi will provide more more more. by then, however, i'd imagine that an occasional sprint to 55 or 60 will seem ""freakin' awesome!""drive it like you live (or rather, as you would like to live). :confuse: "
"fedlawman","January 2012"," mark, great post (as usual). we're all in the same boat, but we're enthusiasts so we want the potential, even if we can't use it.we live for the occasional empty decreasing radius on dodge p (and we know where all of them are located within 12 miles of home), and we want to have the   performance   to squirt through a gap in traffic when we're stuck behind a llc. like owning a jetski or an airplane - we can't use it all the time, but when we do, it's a blast.but your reasoning is sound. that's why i would even entertain the option of owning a   volkswagen   or subaru - ellps   performance   and cockpit, but without the brand cache and chassis prowess that i can't use.btw, my company car is a  chevrolet   chevrolet , so m-f, on dodge ps and the occasional bare stretch of road don't have anything to offer me but temptation. when i'm on my commute and happen to see someone in a 993 or worse, an e30, it just makes me wish i was in my personal car...which i do drive to work occasionally just for the fun of it.

"markcincinnati","January 2012"," ordering a car is ""always"" less money than buying one in inventory.why?#1 dealer has a buyer and will not have any cost of borrowing or at most a very small cost of borrowing -- meaning the discount can be larger (""can be"" doesn't always mean ""will be,"" but hopefully you get the point.)#2 many of the lps and ellps  car  are ""on allocation"" -- as it was explained to me, ""the more  car  i sell, the more  car  i can get."" so, your order will potentially increase the total number of  car  the dealer will be able to get, especially if the brand is from europe, more specifically germany.dealers love ordered  car  -- i would bet, overall, that dealers would love to have only demo's in stock and have 50 or 60  car  on order every month. as far as i know, this is the way it is done in germany (mos acura y). you research your car, you go to the dealer who has a demo -- if you like it you order it.no instant gratification, but the buyer gets exac acura y what he/she wants, not ""close enough for  honda "" as we do in the us.i wanted a pearl white  acura  (check).i wanted it with the umber leather (apparen acura y not possible this year and not even possible as a custom order like the germans allow -- for $2,500 over the normal cost).i accepted pearl white with a black leather   design  . i wanted the  technology  package, too (check).actually come to think of it, the inability to order a car the way you want it, is a strike against acura.oh hell . . . as meat loaf says, ""two out of three ain't bad.""happy freaking new year!

"nyccarguy","January 2012"," excellent posts guys.how   performance   can we really go on our public roads? how much   performance   do we really need? we're car enthusiasts & that's what we want.i live in connecticut & commute to the bronx 6 days a week. the roads i drive on have mos acura y 50 mph (in nyc) & 55 mph (westchester & ct). there's even a 3 lane (each way) parkway i take sometimes with a 45 mph   performance   limit! 2 of my  car  ( honda  &  acura ) have 200 horse  performance   4 cylinder   performance  s. guess what? i seriously have trouble keeping the   performance  os under 80. if i slide my  acura  shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.i've got my  honda  type sh as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance  dodge p attacking, awesome    performance   , stick shift car that i drive to work once a week now.the  acura  is my daily driver. as much as i love driving my  honda , the thickly bolstered, heated leather  seat , automatic  comfort  control, &   technology nology , & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic. my wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids. she prefers driving the  acura  solo as opposed to her 2011  honda  which she chauffers the kids around in all week. it is nice to have 2 automatic transmission  car .i do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different  car  in this class. no way would i even consider a  infiniti x, only a sport/nav/premium  infiniti x. with a bmw, the only way i could even think of affording a 335xi is if it is a cpo car. then i'd have to really think, is it really worth it to get this cpo 335xi over a brand new optioned as i want 328xi? with the upcoming 320i w/ x drive  bmw  2.0l turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of   performance   & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.when the time comes, i'd have to check out the c350 as well. who knows, bmw may have botched the electric   performance   steering (it is lifeless in my  acura )? maybe mbs 7   performance   auto transmission & 3.5 l v6 would be a better fit for my daily commute. i might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too. mbusa's headquarters (as well as bmwusa's) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an mb executive demo car that's rwd instead of the run-of-the mill c300 4matics that every dealership stocks. maybe if i love the mercedes that much, i could live with a rwd car in ct. i'd be willing to live with mb text instead of the full leather.there's been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the  infiniti 's   performance  . fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their  infiniti  sedan.it is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their  car  & have been to driving schools too.

"dino001","January 2012"," it is funny, because the dealers would make you believe they're doing you such a favor by ordering a car the way you want it. germans aren't so bad, but they always start their negotiations from ""if it's an order, it'll be at sticker"", like it was a rule or something. even though, as you mentioned, an ordered car is lower cost to them, they want actually a larger profit on it. classic reverse psychology: you came it, you want it just like it, you must be very motivated, so i'm charging you for that desire - if you walk away, no harm done to my bottom line, yet, as long as there are enough people to come and get something else. on the other hand, the one on my lot is sitting there, if you walk away, i'm still having a car to sell, so i better price it to sell now. it's all instant gratification. when i ordered my  bmw  sportswagon for ed followed by   performance   center delivery (yes, you can combine the two), many people at work could not understand why i would wait for a car for four month, just to get it right. isn't that easier to go there and just get a red one off the lot? they're asking. well, yes, but to me a deal on something you don't really want is not a deal at all.

"markcincinnati","January 2012"," i have been to three audi (in seefeld austria) driving schools and one bmw driving school (here in the us in south  mazda ina). both schools teach you how to  safety , steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at   performance  s   performance  er than you are probably able to imagine yourself going "" toyota ably.""i drive my 305hp  acura  so slowly on interstate 71s on the way to downtown cincinnati, i rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.we had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our state highway patrolman du jour about how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the audi and bmw driving schools even if they never use that term). the first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is not equipped with   safety   (or   safety   control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in  safety  with   safety   vs non-  safety  , the interview was cut short.as i watched this interview unfold, i grew angry since the response from the cop was to not press hard on the    safety    without   safety   and i knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have   safety   . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your    safety    with maximum pressure on the  safety  pedal.""if anyone was about 75% paying attention, i would think they would press on their   safety   equipped car's  safety  pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal. of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!what is the % of   safety   equipped  car ? i've had it in all my  car  since 2000 for pity's sake -- 11+ years.why not talk about getting out and cranking the   performance   with the hand crank?oh crap, i'm way off topic.hmmm, let's see -- ok, i've got it.all ellps and lps (and most other  car  on the market today) have both   safety   and electronic   safety   control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!whew, hopefully i saved it. sorry for going off track. i panicked.burma. :blush: "
